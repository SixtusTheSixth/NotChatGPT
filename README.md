# NotChatGPT

welcome to our DL final project :)

## Generating data on Oscar
SSH into oscar:  
`ssh -X <username>@ssh.ccv.brown.edu`  

The first time you do this, you must clone this repo and install all necessary packages etc. I tihnk the easiest way to do this is by creating the same `csci1470` conda environment we used for all the HWs by following HW0, since it has most of the packages we need. Once you do this and have activated the environment, install these additional packages:  
OpenAI: `conda install -c conda-forge openai`
