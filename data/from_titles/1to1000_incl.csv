"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to learn vector representation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance than conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing procedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since this procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information propagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the higher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global structural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN models suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local information, which would be essential for good model performance, through many message passing steps. In this study, we propose multi-level attention pooling (MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both local and global structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling layer for each message passing step and computes the final graph representation by unifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows models to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of localities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due to oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture improves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline architectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph representations suggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of localities indeed has the potential to improve the discriminability of learned graph representations.",0
"This paper proposes a novel method for graph neural networks (GNN) that utilizes multi-level attention pooling to capture multiple localities within each node in a graph. The proposed approach unifies different graph representations by considering each layer as a separate attention head and combining them using attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in both transductive and inductive settings. Our findings suggest that multi-level attention pooling provides a powerful tool for capturing complex relationships across nodes and improving GNN predictions.",1
"Deep networks and decision forests (such as random forests and gradient boosted trees) are the leading machine learning methods for structured and tabular data, respectively. Many papers have empirically compared large numbers of classifiers on one or two different domains (e.g., on 100 different tabular data settings). However, a careful conceptual and empirical comparison of these two strategies using the most contemporary best practices has yet to be performed. Conceptually, we illustrate that both can be profitably viewed as ""partition and vote"" schemes. Specifically, the representation space that they both learn is a partitioning of feature space into a union of convex polytopes. For inference, each decides on the basis of votes from the activated nodes. This formulation allows for a unified basic understanding of the relationship between these methods. Empirically, we compare these two strategies on hundreds of tabular data settings, as well as several vision and auditory settings. Our focus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent a large fraction of scientific and biomedical datasets. In general, we found forests to excel at tabular and structured data (vision and audition) with small sample sizes, whereas deep nets performed better on structured data with larger sample sizes. This suggests that further gains in both scenarios may be realized via further combining aspects of forests and networks. We will continue revising this technical report in the coming months with updated results.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important over recent years due to advances in machine learning techniques such as decision forest models and deep neural networks. These methods have proven to be highly accurate in many fields, but their performance can vary greatly depending on the dataset size. In particular, decision forest models tend to perform well even with small sample sizes, while deep neural networks often require large amounts of data. The authors investigate the conceptual similarities and empirical differences between these two types of models using experimental results from simulations and real datasets. They find that both models have advantages and disadvantages, with decision forests tending to perform better on smaller datasets and deep neural networks performing better on larger ones. Their results provide insight into which model may be more suitable for different applications and shed light on how the choice of model affects accuracy.",1
"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful tools for graph-structured data. However, they have been recently shown to be vulnerable to topological attacks. To enhance adversarial robustness, we go beyond spectral graph theory to robust graph theory. By challenging the classical graph Laplacian, we propose a new convolution operator that is provably robust in the spectral domain and is incorporated in the GCN architecture to improve expressivity and interpretability. By extending the original graph to a sequence of graphs, we also propose a robust training paradigm that encourages transferability across graphs that span a range of spatial and spectral characteristics. The proposed approaches are demonstrated in extensive experiments to simultaneously improve performance in both benign and adversarial situations.",0
"Graphs play an essential role in encoding many real-world data types such as social networks (Facebook friendships), knowledge graphs (WordNet synonym relations), biochemical interaction maps (protein– protein interactions) and others. In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular for mining graph structured data, thanks largely to the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Since 2017, GNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark datasets across different domains including social network analysis and link prediction, biosequence classification, drug activity prediction and more. While these models have shown powerful representation capabilities on complex node relationships within graphs, they are still susceptible to noise and outliers that can disrupt their accuracy. This study proposes a novel model architecture called Graph Powering Networks (GPNeT) which incorporates explicit control over local receptive fields by applying power operations. We show through rigorous experiments on several publicly available benchmarks, including synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmark datasets from the DeepGraphBenchmark suite and a challenging multi-graph biological dataset, that our proposed method significantly improves predictive accuracy under conditions where traditional GCNs struggle with robustness due to noisy inputs and irregular connectivity patterns. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that GPNeT exhibits better noise tolerance, improved generalization ability over competitive baselines and most importantly maintains high levels of effectiveness throughout various regimes of hyperparameter tuning settings. Our approach enables deeper insight into handling various architectures designed for graphs while providing a clear pathway towards developing new methods fusing power operations into existing ar",1
"With the increasing popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in several sensitive applications like healthcare and medicine, concerns have been raised over the privacy aspects of trained GNNs. More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox access to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy has emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets. Following the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE), recent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models. These teachers are trained on disjoint subsets of private data and are employed to transfer knowledge to a student model, which is then released with privacy guarantees. However, splitting graph data into many disjoint training sets may destroy the structural information and adversely affect accuracy. We propose a new graph-specific scheme of releasing a student GNN, which avoids splitting private training data altogether. The student GNN is trained using public data, partly labeled privately using the teacher GNN models trained exclusively for each query node. We theoretically analyze our approach in the R\`{e}nyi differential privacy framework and provide privacy guarantees. Besides, we show the solid experimental performance of our method compared to several baselines, including the PATE baseline adapted for graph-structured data. Our anonymized code is available.",0
"Title: Enabling Private Deep Learning on Graph Data  Deep learning has revolutionized many fields and empowered applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. However, deep learning models often require large amounts of sensitive data, such as medical records, social network interactions, or financial transactions, which raises privacy concerns. In particular, graph data, widely used across disciplines like computer vision, natural language understanding, bioinformatics, and recommender systems, must be protected while enabling efficient training and inference. Our work introduces novel methods that guarantee differential privacy, ensuring strong protection against reidentification attacks. We propose two algorithms using graph neural networks (GNNs) trained under different levels of constraints. First, we introduce RGDN, a randomized GNN architecture equipped with local sensitivity analysis, making it feasible for real-world deployments. Next, we develop the Sensitive Degrees of Freedom algorithm incorporating knowledge distillation techniques to reduce model complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches compared to state-of-the art private GNN techniques, demonstrating their applicability to diverse domains including drug discovery, personalized medicine, marketing predictions, and fraud detection. These groundbreaking advancements provide a key step towards democratizing machine learning by addressing critical challenges surrounding transparency, security, and accountability in artificial intelligence.",1
"Machine learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays widely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and accountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus, there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature contributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic interpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models that are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks. In this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the decision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by unique fixed points while introducing a deterministic learning method to compute the tunable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art white and black-box models.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to explainable pattern classification using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are specifically designed to incorporate time dependencies into their internal representations. We propose a new architecture called a ""long-term cognitive network"" (LTCN), which uses a combination of RNN cells and convolutional layers to model sequences of data while taking advantage of the strong expressive power of these two types of layers. LTCNs are trained on sequential tasks that require maintaining a memory state over long periods of time, allowing them to learn temporal patterns that would be difficult or impossible for traditional feedforward models to capture.  The key innovation of our method lies in its ability to explicitly represent recurrences within deep architectures without resorting to specialized techniques such as cycle consistency loss or attention mechanisms. By doing so, we achieve more efficient training and better generalization performance compared to prior methods based on attentional or generative models.  Our experiments demonstrate that LTCNs significantly outperform several baseline models on four challenging datasets: MIMIC III, HAR, PAMAP2, and Physionet/CinC Challenge. Moreover, we show that LTCNs provide interpretable explanations of their decision making process by visualizing the evolution of activation patterns throughout each layer over time. Our analysis reveals interesting insights into how different parts of the network contribute to making predictions at various stages during sequence processing.  Overall, this work represents a step forward towards developing recurrence-aware neural networks capable of solving real-world problems in areas such as healthcare informatics where understanding the underlying patterns and dynamics is crucial for improving patient outcomes.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models for many graph-structured tasks. Existing models often assume that a complete structure of a graph is available during training, however, in practice, graph-structured data is usually formed in a streaming fashion, so that learning a graph continuously is often necessary. In this paper, we aim to bridge GNN to lifelong learning by converting a graph problem to a regular learning problem, so that GNN is able to inherit the lifelong learning techniques developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To this end, we propose a new graph topology based on feature cross-correlation, called the feature graph. It takes features as new nodes and turns nodes into independent graphs. This successfully converts the original problem of node classification to graph classification, in which the increasing nodes are turned into independent training samples. In the experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of feature graph networks (FGN) by continuously learning a sequence of classical graph datasets. We also show that FGN achieves superior performance in human action recognition with distributed streaming signals for wearable devices.",0
"Here is a sample abstract:  Lifelong learning has been an active area of research in recent years as machine learning models face increasingly dynamic environments where they need to adapt to new tasks on their own. One approach that has gained popularity in addressing this challenge is graph neural networks (GNNs). However, current GNN methods focus mainly on single task learning and can suffer from performance degradation when faced with multiple tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a lifelong graph learning framework called GLGNN (Graph Learning and Generalization Network), which integrates graph structured knowledge distillation with regularization techniques to achieve continuous adaptation across different tasks. Our method enables better generalization by utilizing task similarities and shared structures among graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning GNN methods on benchmark datasets and real-world applications. This study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating both model transferability and capacity for handling multiple tasks during the training process.  Abstract: ""Learning to Adapt Across Tasks: Graph Neural Networks Meet Transfer Learning""  In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the use of graph neural networks (GNN) for continual learning under varying task conditions. We begin with a thorough analysis of the challenges presented when deploying traditional GNN architectures in these scenarios before introducing several strategies designed to mitigate against overfitting and promote generalizability. These techniques leverage insights drawn from classical machine learning literature while remaining true to the core principles of message passing and attention mechanisms at the heart of contemporary graph-based deep learning solutions. Through extensive experiments spanning multiple domains, we show that each component of our system can bring meaningful improvements to existing workflows in isolation but together lead to marked enhancements in overall performance. Ultimately, our findings suggest that the marriage of advanced neural network components alongside well-established concepts from transfer learning holds significant promise for researchers looking to build robust systems capable of thriving under uncertainty",1
"Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, have long been applied to image and multi-media tasks, particularly those with structured data. More recently, there has been more attention to unstructured data that can be represented via graphs. These types of data are often found in health and medicine, social networks, and research data repositories. Graph convolutional neural networks have recently gained attention in the field of deep learning that takes advantage of graph-based data representation with automatic feature extraction via convolutions. Given the popularity of these methods in a wide range of applications, robust uncertainty quantification is vital. This remains a challenge for large models and unstructured datasets. Bayesian inference provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification of model parameters for deep learning models. Although Bayesian inference has been used extensively elsewhere, its application to deep learning remains limited due to the computational requirements of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Recent advances in parallel computing and advanced proposal schemes in MCMC sampling methods has opened the path for Bayesian deep learning. In this paper, we present Bayesian graph convolutional neural networks that employ tempered MCMC sampling with Langevin-gradient proposal distribution implemented via parallel computing. Our results show that the proposed method can provide accuracy similar to advanced optimisers while providing uncertainty quantification for key benchmark problems.",0
"Title: ""Bayesian Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Using Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo."" Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying machine learning techniques to complex scientific problems. One promising approach is the use of graph convolutional neural networks (CNN), which can leverage both spatial and spectral features of data on graphs. However, training these models often requires large amounts of annotated data, which can be difficult to obtain in many applications. To address this issue, we propose using tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to train Bayesian CNNs that efficiently estimate uncertainty in their predictions. Our approach allows us to effectively regularize our model by incorporating prior knowledge through probabilistic inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms standard variational approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our work paves the way for more reliable and accurate predictions in real-world scenarios where annotation data may be limited.",1
"A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) stacks several layers and in each layer performs a PROPagation operation (PROP) and a TRANsformation operation (TRAN) for learning node representations over graph-structured data. Though powerful, GCNs tend to suffer performance drop when the model gets deep. Previous works focus on PROPs to study and mitigate this issue, but the role of TRANs is barely investigated. In this work, we study performance degradation of GCNs by experimentally examining how stacking only TRANs or PROPs works. We find that TRANs contribute significantly, or even more than PROPs, to declining performance, and moreover that they tend to amplify node-wise feature variance in GCNs, causing variance inflammation that we identify as a key factor for causing performance drop. Motivated by such observations, we propose a variance-controlling technique termed Node Normalization (NodeNorm), which scales each node's features using its own standard deviation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of NodeNorm on addressing performance degradation of GCNs. Specifically, it enables deep GCNs to outperform shallow ones in cases where deep models are needed, and to achieve comparable results with shallow ones on 6 benchmark datasets. NodeNorm is a generic plug-in and can well generalize to other GNN architectures. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/miafei/NodeNorm.",0
"Title: Uncovering Factors Causing Performance Decline in Graph Convolutional Networks  As graph convolutional networks (GCN) gain increasing popularity due to their outstanding performance on semi-supervised tasks involving irregularly structured data such as social network graphs, understanding the factors causing performance decline becomes crucial. While existing GCN models have demonstrated impressive results, researchers still struggle to fully comprehend why certain modifications might lead to poorer outcomes, hindering progress in developing cutting-edge architectures that consistently deliver improved accuracy. This study seeks to shed light on those issues by analyzing key aspects impacting GCN performance. By scrutinizing architectural components, data characteristics, training strategies, and hyperparameter configurations, we unveil root causes underlying degraded model outputs. Our findings offer valuable insights into constructing efficient models tailored to specific use cases while helping practitioners diagnose common problems encountered during implementation. With extensive experimental validation and detailed discussion, our work provides a well-rounded examination of performance bottlenecks in GCN models, serving both academics and industry professionals alike.",1
"Transformer neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results for unstructured data such as text and images but their adoption for graph-structured data has been limited. This is partly due to the difficulty of incorporating complex structural information in the basic transformer framework. We propose a simple yet powerful extension to the transformer - residual edge channels. The resultant framework, which we call Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (EGT), can directly accept, process and output structural information as well as node information. It allows us to use global self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and comes with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the edge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer, and prediction tasks on edges/links can be performed directly from the output embeddings of these channels. In addition, we introduce a generalized positional encoding scheme for graphs based on Singular Value Decomposition which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which relies on global node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared to Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks, which rely on local feature aggregation within a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in a supervised learning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our findings indicate that convolutional aggregation is not an essential inductive bias for graphs and global self-attention can serve as a flexible and adaptive alternative.",0
"This sounds like an interesting study on graph transformers! Here is a potential abstract for your paper:  ""In recent years, there has been growing interest in using deep learning techniques such as graph transformers to model complex relationships between data points. However, one common challenge faced by researchers working with graph transformers is how to handle edge information in addition to node features. Some approaches have proposed augmenting graph transformer models with additional layers specifically designed for processing edges, but these can lead to increased computational complexity and may not always outperform simpler methods. In this work, we explore whether global self-attention mechanisms alone can effectively capture important edge information, without needing specialized edge-specific layers. Our experiments show that indeed, relying solely on global attention is sufficient for achieving strong performance on benchmark datasets across a variety of tasks.""

"Link prediction is one of the key problems for graph-structured data. With the advancement of graph neural networks, graph autoencoders (GAEs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) have been proposed to learn graph embeddings in an unsupervised way. It has been shown that these methods are effective for link prediction tasks. However, they do not work well in link predictions when a node whose degree is zero (i.g., isolated node) is involved. We have found that GAEs/VGAEs make embeddings of isolated nodes close to zero regardless of their content features. In this paper, we propose a novel Variational Graph Normalized AutoEncoder (VGNAE) that utilize L2-normalization to derive better embeddings for isolated nodes. We show that our VGNAEs outperform the existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/VGNAE.",0
"In recent years, graph normalization has emerged as an important technique in deep learning, allowing for improved performance on tasks such as image generation and semantic segmentation.

Our approach involves training an encoder network to learn both an estimate of data density and a mapping from input variables to lower dimensional latent code, while also leveraging graph attention mechanisms to enable flexible, adaptive normalization during training and inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments comparing against state-of-the-art baselines, showing significant improvements on key metrics across a range of challenging tasks. Overall, VGNAEs provide a powerful new tool for deep learning researchers seeking to develop high-performing generative models using modern graph normalization techniques.",1
"Data augmentation has been widely used in image data and linguistic data but remains under-explored on graph-structured data. Existing methods focus on augmenting the graph data from a global perspective and largely fall into two genres: structural manipulation and adversarial training with feature noise injection. However, the structural manipulation approach suffers information loss issues while the adversarial training approach may downgrade the feature quality by injecting noise. In this work, we introduce the local augmentation, which enhances node features by its local subgraph structures. Specifically, we model the data argumentation as a feature generation process. Given the central node's feature, our local augmentation approach learns the conditional distribution of its neighbors' features and generates the neighbors' optimal feature to boost the performance of downstream tasks. Based on the local augmentation, we further design a novel framework: LA-GNN, which can apply to any GNN models in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments and analyses show that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement for various GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Soughing0823/LAGNN.",0
"Recently there has been a surge of interest in developing models that can leverage graph structures within machine learning tasks such as node classification, edge prediction and graph generation. In particular, attention mechanisms have gained traction due to their ability to adaptively select which elements of a structured input to focus on at any given time step during training or inference. However, while these methods have shown great promise in many scenarios, they often suffer from scalability issues arising from the high computational cost of applying global attention operators over entire graphs. Here we explore local augmentations to address these limitations by adapting attention mechanisms to operate independently around small substructures of individual nodes and edges within larger graphs. These techniques significantly reduce the number of matrix multiplications required by traditional attention networks while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling faster model evaluation and inference on smaller hardware devices. We empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets across diverse domains including social network analysis, bioinformatics and chemical compound optimization. Our results show consistent improvements both in terms of execution time and test set performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in improving the efficiency of graph neural networks without sacrificing their overall performance.",1
"Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial competitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed learning paradigm, provides possibilities to solve this challenge while preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and contains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models, and FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains, including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as hERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs perform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not maintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more research efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs. Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN system is computationally efficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets. We maintain the source code at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedGraphNN.",0

"Interpreting deep neural networks from the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) perspective has inspired many efficient and robust network architectures. However, existing ODE based approaches ignore the relationship among data points, which is a critical component in many problems including few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning. In this paper, inspired by the diffusive ODEs, we propose a novel diffusion residual network (Diff-ResNet) to strengthen the interactions among data points. Under the structured data assumption, it is proved that the diffusion mechanism can decrease the distance-diameter ratio that improves the separability of inter-class points and reduces the distance among local intra-class points. This property can be easily adopted by the residual networks for constructing the separable hyperplanes. The synthetic binary classification experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion mechanism. Moreover, extensive experiments of few-shot image classification and semi-supervised graph node classification in various datasets validate the advantages of the proposed Diff-ResNet over existing few-shot learning methods.",0
"Deep learning has revolutionized many application domains, but designing deep models that can handle few-shot tasks remains challenging. While recent methods based on meta learning have achieved remarkable results, they still suffer from limitations such as lack of stability and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In our work, we propose a new approach for few-shot learning using diffused residual networks (Diff-ResNets). Our method employs ODEs to model complex data relationships without relying on explicit representations like neural networks. Instead, we learn interpretable basis functions that capture task-specific information, allowing us to achieve better generalization and robustness across diverse tasks. We evaluate our method on standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the art performance while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of ODE-based approaches for few-shot learning and open up new directions for future research.",1
"The success of machine learning stems from its structured data representation. Similar data have close representation as compressed codes for classification or emerged labels for clustering. We observe that the frequency of the internal representation follows power laws in both supervised and unsupervised learning. The scale-invariant distribution implies that machine learning largely compresses frequent typical data, and at the same time, differentiates many atypical data as outliers. In this study, we derive how the power laws can naturally arise in machine learning. In terms of information theory, the scale-invariant representation corresponds to a maximally uncertain data grouping among possible representations that guarantee pre-specified learning accuracy.",0
"Machine Learning (ML) has been used successfully across many applications over the last decade. As datasets grow larger and more complex, scaling up ML models becomes important to meet growing demand for performance. Unfortunately, as these models scale up there is often a corresponding increase in computational complexity. This makes deployment difficult as well as increasing costs. In addition, current techniques for scaling up ML require significant retraining time on existing models, even if one only wishes to change parameters of those models. Researchers at Company have developed a method that allows them to scale the size of data without incurring the same increase in model size and training cost which enables improved model performance while simultaneously reducing latency. The new technique can be applied retroactively to previously trained neural networks without having to go back through all previous layers of computation making it possible to achieve high accuracy models within minutes rather than hours. This research helps pave the road towards realtime large language processing capabilities using deep learning methods such as natural language understanding. Additionally, the research shows promise for developing explainable versions of other classes of large language models as the architecture utilized by the new approach was found highly interpretable during internal experiments allowing for more transparent systems design. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards applying deep learning techniques to problems where rapid feedback is required and achieving state of the art results quickly",1
"Sensitive medical data is often subject to strict usage constraints. In this paper, we trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) on real-world electronic health records (EHR). It was then used to create a data-set of ""fake"" patients through synthetic data generation (SDG) to circumvent usage constraints. This real-world data was tabular, binary, intensive care unit (ICU) patient diagnosis data. The entire data-set was split into separate data silos to mimic real-world scenarios where multiple ICU units across different hospitals may have similarly structured data-sets within their own organisations but do not have access to each other's data-sets. We implemented federated learning (FL) to train separate GANs locally at each organisation, using their unique data silo and then combining the GANs into a single central GAN, without any siloed data ever being exposed. This global, central GAN was then used to generate the synthetic patients data-set. We performed an evaluation of these synthetic patients with statistical measures and through a structured review by a group of medical professionals. It was shown that there was no significant reduction in the quality of the synthetic EHR when we moved between training a single central model and training on separate data silos with individual models before combining them into a central model. This was true for both the statistical evaluation (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0154 for single-source vs. RMSE of 0.0169 for dual-source federated) and also for the medical professionals' evaluation (no quality difference between EHR generated from a single source and EHR generated from multiple sources).",0
"Electronic health records (EHRs) contain vast amounts of data that can be used to improve patient outcomes, develop new treatments, and inform public health policy. However, accessing these records can be difficult due to privacy concerns and limited accessibility. To address these challenges, we propose using federated learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic EHRs that preserve the statistical properties of real EHRs while protecting individual patient identities.  Our approach involves training a GAN on a subset of de-identified EHRs from multiple institutions. The generator network produces synthetic EHRs, which are then evaluated by a discriminator network that determines if they are real or fake. Through iterative training, the generator learns to create more realistic synthetic EHRs that closely mimic real EHRs. These synthetic EHRs can then be shared among researchers without compromising patient privacy.  We evaluate our method through experiments involving two datasets containing over one million de-identified EHRs from different hospitals. Our results show that our model effectively generates synthetic EHRs that match the distribution of real EHRs across various clinical measures such as age, gender, admission type, length of stay, and mortality rate. We further demonstrate that these synthetic EHRs maintain patient privacy by conducting differential privacy analysis and showing low disclosure risk under simulated attacks.  Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of federated GANs in generating synthetic EHRs that could revolutionize medical research and practice while preserving patients’ privacy. Our future work includes expanding the dataset size and diversity, evaluating the performance of the generated records in downstream tasks such as disease diagnosis and treatment recommendations, and exploring additional applications such as personalized medicine and drug development.",1
"Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), the most prominent Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this paper, we conduct a structured study of the effect of sparsification on the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature, the sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks while containing significantly fewer trainable parameters. In experiments with matching parameter numbers, our benchmark models outperform the state-of-the-art GNN models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ChangminWu/ExpanderGNN.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results across numerous applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. However, the high computational complexity and memory requirements hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. One key component responsible for the high computation cost and large memory footprint of GNNs is the update step, which performs convolution operations over neighborhood structures, leading to redundant computations and dense representations. To address these issues, we propose sparsifying the graph structure before applying the GNN models to reduce unnecessary calculations while preserving most of the important features. Our method leverages random edge sampling techniques combined with pruning algorithms based on statistical analysis of the graphs’ edge importance.

"Graph feature extraction is a fundamental task in graphs analytics. Using feature vectors (graph descriptors) in tandem with data mining algorithms that operate on Euclidean data, one can solve problems such as classification, clustering, and anomaly detection on graph-structured data. This idea has proved fruitful in the past, with spectral-based graph descriptors providing state-of-the-art classification accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, these algorithms do not scale to large graphs since: 1) they require storing the entire graph in memory, and 2) the end-user has no control over the algorithm's runtime. In this paper, we present single-pass streaming algorithms to approximate structural features of graphs (counts of subgraphs of order $k \geq 4$). Operating on edge streams allows us to avoid keeping the entire graph in memory, and controlling the sample size enables us to control the time taken by the algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our descriptors by analyzing the approximation error, classification accuracy, and scalability to massive graphs. Our experiments showcase the effect of the sample size on approximation error and predictive accuracy. The proposed descriptors are applicable on graphs with millions of edges within minutes and outperform the state-of-the-art descriptors in classification accuracy.",0
"In recent years, graph descriptors have become increasingly important in many applications such as computer vision and data mining. These descriptors aim to capture the topological properties of graphs that can effectively summarize their structure in a scalar value. However, computing these descriptors efficiently over large graphs remains challenging due to their quadratic computational complexity. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a new method for computing graph descriptors on edge streams, which are sequences of edges in a graph that arrive incrementally over time. Our approach leverages the inherent parallelism offered by stream processing engines to significantly reduce the computation cost while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on real-world datasets that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both scalability and efficiency. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of our framework by applying it to different types of graph descriptors and streaming settings, including one-pass and multi-pass processing. Our work paves the way towards enabling efficient graph analysis over dynamic and evolving graphs with high-throughput requirements.",1
"Networks are ubiquitous in the real world such as social networks and communication networks, and anomaly detection on networks aims at finding nodes whose structural or attributed patterns deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes. However, most of the traditional anomaly detection methods neglect the relation structure information among data points and therefore cannot effectively generalize to the graph structure data. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model of Deep Dual Support Vector Data description based Autoencoder (Dual-SVDAE) for anomaly detection on attributed networks, which considers both the structure and attribute for attributed networks. Specifically, Dual-SVDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute autoencoder to learn the latent representation of the node in the structure space and attribute space respectively. Then, a dual-hypersphere learning mechanism is imposed on them to learn two hyperspheres of normal nodes from the structure and attribute perspectives respectively. Moreover, to achieve joint learning between the structure and attribute of the network, we fuse the structure embedding and attribute embedding as the final input of the feature decoder to generate the node attribute. Finally, abnormal nodes can be detected by measuring the distance of nodes to the learned center of each hypersphere in the latent structure space and attribute space respectively. Extensive experiments on the real-world attributed networks show that Dual-SVDAE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0
"In recent years, data mining has become increasingly important as more businesses and organizations collect large amounts of data on their operations and customers. However, making sense of all that data can be difficult without the proper tools and methods. One approach that has gained popularity recently is anomaly detection - identifying unexpected patterns or behaviors in the data that could indicate potential problems or opportunities. This paper presents a new method called ""Deep Dual Support Vector Data Description"" (DDSVD2) for detecting anomalies in attributed networks.  Attributed networks have nodes that represent objects or entities and edges that describe relationships or interactions between them. Many real-world systems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks, can be modeled using attributed networks. Detecting anomalies in these networks is crucial for understanding system behavior and improving decision-making processes.  The proposed DDSVD2 method uses deep learning techniques to identify anomalies by modeling the structure and properties of attributed networks. Specifically, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a low-dimensional representation of network structures based on node attributes and graph topology. We then apply a robust multi-task optimization framework to obtain sparse representations of both normal and abnormal samples, which allows us to separate anomalous patterns from normal ones effectively. Finally, we introduce a novel regularizer to constrain the solution space during training, further enhancing performance and stability.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines across several benchmark datasets representing different types of anomalies in attributed networks. Our approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.  Overall, this work contributes to the field of anomaly de",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great power in modeling graph structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs may make biased predictions w.r.t protected sensitive attributes, e.g., skin color and gender. This is because the training data often contains historical bias towards sensitive attributes. In addition, we empirically show that the discrimination in GNNs can be magnified by graph structures and the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. As a result, the applications of GNNs in high-stake domains such as crime rate prediction would be largely limited. Though extensive studies of fair classification have been conducted on i.i.d data, methods to address the problem of discrimination on non-i.i.d data are rather limited. Generally, learning fair models require abundant sensitive attributes to regularize the model. However, for many graphs such as social networks, users are reluctant to share sensitive attributes. Thus, only limited sensitive attributes are available for fair GNN training in practice. Moreover, directly collecting and applying the sensitive attributes in fair model training may cause privacy issues, because the sensitive information can be leaked in data breach or attacks on the trained model. Therefore, we study a novel and crucial problem of learning fair GNNs with limited and private sensitive attribute information. In an attempt to address these problems, FairGNN is proposed to eliminate the bias of GNNs whilst maintaining high accuracy by leveraging graph structures and limited sensitive information. We further extend FairGNN to NT-FairGNN which can achieve both fairness and privacy on sensitive attributes by using limited and private sensitive attributes. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGNN and NT-FairGNN in achieving fair and high-accurate classification.",0
"Abstract: Artificial neural networks have become increasingly important tools for analyzing data, making predictions and enabling decision-making processes. However, using these models can raise privacy concerns as they may require access to sensitive personal attributes that users would prefer to keep confidential. To address this challenge, we propose a new methodology called ""Fair Graph Neural Network"" (fGNN) which enables training machine learning algorithms on datasets containing limited and private attribute information. This approach is based on graph convolutional networks and uses node features as well as their neighborhood relationships to infer missing values. We demonstrate through experimental evaluations that our model achieves high accuracy while maintaining strict privacy requirements. The proposed solution has applications across various domains including medical research, financial analysis, social network analysis, among others. Overall, fGNN provides an effective means to balance the need for accurate prediction models against the desire for privacy and data security.",1
Learning distributions over graph-structured data is a challenging task with many applications in biology and chemistry. In this work we use an energy-based model (EBM) based on multi-channel graph neural networks (GNN) to learn permutation invariant unnormalized density functions on graphs. Unlike standard EBM training methods our approach is to learn the model via minimizing adversarial stein discrepancy. Samples from the model can be obtained via Langevin dynamics based MCMC. We find that this approach achieves competitive results on graph generation compared to benchmark models.,0
"Advances in deep learning have made generative models more versatile than ever before, enabling a wide range of applications across numerous domains. However, many existing approaches remain limited by their reliance on simplified mathematical models that fail to capture key aspects of real-world systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on adversarial training to overcome these limitations and develop graph energy models (GEMs) capable of generating high-fidelity data samples. Our method leverages adversarial techniques to optimize GEM parameters, producing highly accurate and efficient models suitable for complex tasks such as drug discovery and protein structure prediction. We demonstrate our model’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives through extensive experimentation, showcasing its ability to achieve remarkable accuracy while maintaining interpretability and robustness. This research paves the way for broader adoption of generative methods in scientific inquiry, opening up new possibilities in fields where precise predictive models are crucial.",1
"UMAP is a non-parametric graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithm using applied Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology to find low-dimensional embeddings of structured data. The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1) Compute a graphical representation of a dataset (fuzzy simplicial complex), and (2) Through stochastic gradient descent, optimize a low-dimensional embedding of the graph. Here, we extend the second step of UMAP to a parametric optimization over neural network weights, learning a parametric relationship between data and embedding. We first demonstrate that Parametric UMAP performs comparably to its non-parametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a learned parametric mapping (e.g. fast online embeddings for new data). We then explore UMAP as a regularization, constraining the latent distribution of autoencoders, parametrically varying global structure preservation, and improving classifier accuracy for semi-supervised learning by capturing structure in unlabeled data.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize the deep neural networks to graph-structured data, have achieved great success in modeling graphs. However, as an extension of deep learning for graphs, GNNs lack explainability, which largely limits their adoption in scenarios that demand the transparency of models. Though many efforts are taken to improve the explainability of deep learning, they mainly focus on i.i.d data, which cannot be directly applied to explain the predictions of GNNs because GNNs utilize both node features and graph topology to make predictions. There are only very few work on the explainability of GNNs and they focus on post-hoc explanations. Since post-hoc explanations are not directly obtained from the GNNs, they can be biased and misrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of self-explainable GNNs which can simultaneously give predictions and explanations. We propose a new framework which can find $K$-nearest labeled nodes for each unlabeled node to give explainable node classification, where nearest labeled nodes are found by interpretable similarity module in terms of both node similarity and local structure similarity. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for explainable node classification.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in handling graph structured data which appears pervasively across various domains. However, despite their successes, explaining why GNNs produce certain outputs remains difficult because the intrinsic nonlinearity and parallel nature of these models makes it hard to ascertain their reasoning process. In our proposed methodology, we provide a way towards self-explainability through a novel model architecture called Diffusion GCN, wherein we design explainable units that capture relevant features from different neighborhood areas within the input graphs. These mechanisms allow us to accurately interpret how each node contribution impacts the final prediction outcome and thus furnish insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on real world benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of Diffusion GCN against other state-of-the art methods by achieving competitive accuracy while providing meaningful explanations, making it appealing for applications demanding transparency, such as social network analysis and drug discovery.",1
"Representation learning on static graph-structured data has shown a significant impact on many real-world applications. However, less attention has been paid to the evolving nature of temporal networks, in which the edges are often changing over time. The embeddings of such temporal networks should encode both graph-structured information and the temporally evolving pattern. Existing approaches in learning temporally evolving network representations fail to capture the temporal interdependence. In this paper, we propose Toffee, a novel approach for temporal network representation learning based on tensor decomposition. Our method exploits the tensor-tensor product operator to encode the cross-time information, so that the periodic changes in the evolving networks can be captured. Experimental results demonstrate that Toffee outperforms existing methods on multiple real-world temporal networks in generating effective embeddings for the link prediction tasks.",0

The methodology has promising applications in domains where temporal dynamics play important roles, including social science, transportation systems, and finance. The code is made publicly available to foster future research.",1
"Graph structured data have enabled several successful applications such as recommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and edges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order adjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data holders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder will only own either the node features or edge information), different data holders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly transfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on the edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features will first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency information. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint information and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to provide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test nodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via influence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via designing adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller is able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming existing baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an existing algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP GCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these DP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under mild privacy guarantees ($\varepsilon5$). Our studies will shed light on future research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models; in the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between GCN model utility and robustness against potential privacy attacks.",0

"Spatio-temporal forecasting is of great importance in a wide range of dynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19 spread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of spatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning characteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics laws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions. One of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate the perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through the distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of machine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for model training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is objectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human intervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics of the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints, an active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most informative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable environment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit that the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal accuracy with substantially fewer instances.",0
"Abstract: In this work we present a novel framework called ""Physics-Coupled Spatio-Temporal Active Learning"" (PCSAL) that enables data-efficient learning of nonlinear dynamical systems by actively sampling their spatiotemporal states under uncertainties. Unlike existing methods, which often rely on predefined uncertainty metrics and fixed sampling strategies, PCSAL adapts the spatio-temporal distribution of sampling points based on both state estimations from physical simulations and model predictions. This ensures more accurate representation of dynamics along critical regions such as phase transitions or bifurcations, while also enabling efficient exploration of large datasets using minimal resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various examples ranging from linear chaos circuits to nonlinear thermoacoustic systems and a turbulent flow system. Our results indicate significant improvements in accuracy compared to prior active learning techniques, highlighting the advantages of incorporating physics constraints into data acquisition and exploitation processes.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been popularly used in analyzing graph-structured data, showing promising results in various applications such as node classification, link prediction and network recommendation. In this paper, we present a new graph attention neural network, namely GIPA, for attributed graph data learning. GIPA consists of three key components: attention, feature propagation and aggregation. Specifically, the attention component introduces a new multi-layer perceptron based multi-head to generate better non-linear feature mapping and representation than conventional implementations such as dot-product. The propagation component considers not only node features but also edge features, which differs from existing GNNs that merely consider node features. The aggregation component uses a residual connection to generate the final embedding. We evaluate the performance of GIPA using the Open Graph Benchmark proteins (ogbn-proteins for short) dataset. The experimental results reveal that GIPA can beat the state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy, e.g., GIPA achieves an average test ROC-AUC of $0.8700\pm 0.0010$ and outperforms all the previous methods listed in the ogbn-proteins leaderboard.",0
"In recent years, graph learning has emerged as a powerful tool in fields such as machine learning and data analysis. However, existing algorithms suffer from drawbacks including high computational complexity, poor scalability, and limited generalizability across different types of graphs.

Our approach relies on a diffusion model combined with a smart neighborhood selection strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. This work contributes to the development of effective and efficient graph learning techniques applicable to real-world problems in diverse domains.",1
"Structured text understanding on Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) is a crucial part of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in VRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing studies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity linking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at both token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the solutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels. This paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and effective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer, we introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling and entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we design a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn a richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language Modeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction tasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and layout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at segment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and EPHOIE datasets.",0
"This paper presents ""StrucTexT"", a new model architecture that aims to improve text understanding by allowing models to learn from multiple sources of data such as images, videos, audio etc along with the traditional text data. Our approach uses multi modal transformer architectures which have achieved state of art performance on several natural language processing tasks but lack the ability to take advantage of extra modalities available at training time. In particular we propose extending these architectures to explicitly consider structure within input data and use them for jointly representing structured knowledge across different modalities. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets including both standard NLP benchmarks like GLUE as well as more specialized ones focused on multi modal fusion and show significant improvements compared to the previous state of art methods using only textual representation of knowledge. As one concrete application, we present results showing how our trained model can generate descriptions of object scenes directly conditioned on video inputs, improving over strong baselines.",1
"One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to trigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning normally otherwise. Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous data (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary; input-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic -- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of security-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA. We further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss potential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning representations from graphs, achieving state-of-the-art results on a wide range of tasks including node classification, edge prediction, and community detection.

This work examines the threat posed by graph backdoors to GNNs and presents new techniques that improve robustness against such attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over existing defenses. Our findings highlight the importance of developing effective defense mechanisms to protect machine learning models from adversarial inputs.",1
"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in the task of semantically segmenting images. Applying the same methods on 3D data still poses challenges due to the heavy memory requirements and the lack of structured data. Here, we propose LatticeNet, a novel approach for 3D semantic segmentation, which takes raw point clouds as input. A PointNet describes the local geometry which we embed into a sparse permutohedral lattice. The lattice allows for fast convolutions while keeping a low memory footprint. Further, we introduce DeformSlice, a novel learned data-dependent interpolation for projecting lattice features back onto the point cloud. We present results of 3D segmentation on multiple datasets where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also extend and evaluate our network for instance and dynamic object segmentation.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great promise in solving many challenges related to point cloud segmentation. Many state-of-the-art methods use either graph neural networks (GNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task, but these approaches can suffer from high computational complexity or limited scalability due to their memory requirements. To address this issue, we propose LatticeNet, which utilizes permutohedral lattices as feature spaces to learn global features across point clouds while maintaining local geometry information during the training process. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark datasets while offering superior runtime performance on CPUs. In summary, our work demonstrates that using lattice representations can significantly improve point cloud segmentation accuracy without sacrificing speed. By leveraging permutohedral lattices, we provide a fast and efficient solution capable of handling large-scale datasets and enabling real-time applications. The proposed approach represents an important step toward realizing real-world applications for autonomous driving, robotics, and other fields where point cloud data is commonly used. This work has significant implications for advancing research in computer vision and offers opportunities for future exploration into lattice representations and deep learning techniques applied to spatial data structures. Overall, we believe that LatticeNet paves the way for more effective solutions in spatio-temporal point cloud segmentation, opening up new possibilities for emerging technologies relying on perceptual input like self-driving cars or industrial robots.",1
"Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) on the graph with real-life applications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of finding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised learning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The underlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN) for encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured data in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is followed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and make an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution. Recent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial problems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed model aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective function. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a classical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep RL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard problems. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that existing RL-based model may not generalize to QAP.",0

"Deep learning's performance has been extensively recognized recently. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to deal with graph-structural data that classical deep learning does not easily manage. Since most GNNs were created using distinct theories, direct comparisons are impossible. Prior research has primarily concentrated on categorizing existing models, with little attention paid to their intrinsic connections. The purpose of this study is to establish a unified framework that integrates GNNs based on spectral graph and approximation theory. The framework incorporates a strong integration between spatial- and spectral-based GNNs while tightly associating approaches that exist within each respective domain.",0
"This paper proposes a unified framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) that bridges the gap between spatial and spectral domains. Traditionally, GNNs have been limited by their reliance on either spatial or spectral representations alone, which can lead to suboptimal performance and limitations in model expressivity. Our proposed approach addresses these issues by combining both types of representations into a single, coherent framework. We showcase how our method achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness at handling complex relationships within graphs. By introducing novel hybrid convolutional layers, we enable more efficient message passing among neighboring nodes, leading to improved accuracy. Additionally, through ablation studies and visualization techniques, we provide insights into the working mechanisms behind our unified framework. Ultimately, our work represents a step towards developing robust and generalizable GNN models capable of tackling a wide range of graph data challenges.",1
"Decision forests (Forests), in particular random forests and gradient boosting trees, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other methods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, Forests dominate other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured, so that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices. However, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and speech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks (ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the reason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature magnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest approach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random matrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of Networks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes corresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one can choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature locality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live on three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we demonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show superiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting movement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions. In all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF) algorithm outperforms approaches that ignore feature space structure and challenges the performance of ConvNets. Moreover, MORF runs fast and maintains interpretability and theoretical justification.",0
"Machine learning has made significant strides over the past few years, driven by advancements in algorithms, hardware, and data availability.

This paper proposes using MORF as an alternative to CDNs for computer vision applications. We compare our proposed method to several state-of-the-art CDN architectures on four popular benchmark datasets and show competitive results while being significantly faster and less memory-intensive. Our experimental results suggest that MORF can effectively bridge the gap between simpler machine learning methods and CDNs, opening up new possibilities for efficient and accurate image recognition systems. Overall, we believe that MORF represents a promising direction for future research in computer vision and other high-dimensional data problems.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great success in learning from graph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as recommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions of edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training GNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the Deep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL distributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings) across the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational decomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous training approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include non-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed computations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph partitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows it to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations. It further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using sparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows DistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency and memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and transductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup without compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a training epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a cluster with 16 machines. DistDGL is now publicly available as part of DGL:https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/python/dgl/distributed.",0

"Data selection methods, such as active learning and core-set selection, are useful tools for improving the data efficiency of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. However, recent deep learning models have moved forward from independent and identically distributed data to graph-structured data, such as social networks, e-commerce user-item graphs, and knowledge graphs. This evolution has led to the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that go beyond the models existing data selection methods are designed for. Therefore, we present Grain, an efficient framework that opens up a new perspective through connecting data selection in GNNs with social influence maximization. By exploiting the common patterns of GNNs, Grain introduces a novel feature propagation concept, a diversified influence maximization objective with novel influence and diversity functions, and a greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee into a unified framework. Empirical studies on public datasets demonstrate that Grain significantly improves both the performance and efficiency of data selection (including active learning and core-set selection) for GNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to bridge two largely parallel threads of research, data selection, and social influence maximization, in the setting of GNNs, paving new ways for improving data efficiency.",0

"The geometric structure of an optimization landscape is argued to be fundamentally important to support the success of deep neural network learning. A direct computation of the landscape beyond two layers is hard. Therefore, to capture the global view of the landscape, an interpretable model of the network-parameter (or weight) space must be established. However, the model is lacking so far. Furthermore, it remains unknown what the landscape looks like for deep networks of binary synapses, which plays a key role in robust and energy efficient neuromorphic computation. Here, we propose a statistical mechanics framework by directly building a least structured model of the high-dimensional weight space, considering realistic structured data, stochastic gradient descent training, and the computational depth of neural networks. We also consider whether the number of network parameters outnumbers the number of supplied training data, namely, over- or under-parametrization. Our least structured model reveals that the weight spaces of the under-parametrization and over-parameterization cases belong to the same class, in the sense that these weight spaces are well-connected without any hierarchical clustering structure. In contrast, the shallow-network has a broken weight space, characterized by a discontinuous phase transition, thereby clarifying the benefit of depth in deep learning from the angle of high dimensional geometry. Our effective model also reveals that inside a deep network, there exists a liquid-like central part of the architecture in the sense that the weights in this part behave as randomly as possible, providing algorithmic implications. Our data-driven model thus provides a statistical mechanics insight about why deep learning is unreasonably effective in terms of the high-dimensional weight space, and how deep networks are different from shallow ones.",0
"Developing robust models that can effectively handle complex data sets is a challenging task faced by researchers working on artificial intelligence (AI). In recent years, many studies have shown promising results using data-driven approaches such as deep learning (DL) algorithms. Despite these advancements, there are still limitations regarding their reliability, scalability, and interpretability. Addressing these concerns requires innovative techniques capable of adapting to diverse data types while maintaining high performance levels. This study presents a novel DL approach called ""liquid deep learning"" (LL), which combines key features from both traditional machine learning methods and modern DL architectures. Our experiments demonstrate that LL offers significant improvements over state-of-the-art DL models in terms of accuracy, speed, and efficiency. Additionally, our proposed methodology ensures stability under varying conditions, making it suitable for real-world applications requiring reliable predictions across multiple domains. By addressing important considerations like generalization ability and robustness, we aim to bring forward a step change in AI research, paving the way for more accurate, dependable DL systems, essential for future progress in many fields.",1
"Despite the remarkable success of deep learning, optimal convolution operation on point cloud remains indefinite due to its irregular data structure. In this paper, we present Cubic Kernel Convolution (CKConv) that learns to voxelize the features of local points by exploiting both continuous and discrete convolutions. Our continuous convolution uniquely employs a 3D cubic form of kernel weight representation that splits a feature into voxels in embedding space. By consecutively applying discrete 3D convolutions on the voxelized features in a spatial manner, preceding continuous convolution is forced to learn spatial feature mapping, i.e., feature voxelization. In this way, geometric information can be detailed by encoding with subdivided features, and our 3D convolutions on these fixed structured data do not suffer from discretization artifacts thanks to voxelization in embedding space. Furthermore, we propose a spatial attention module, Local Set Attention (LSA), to provide comprehensive structure awareness within the local point set and hence produce representative features. By learning feature voxelization with LSA, CKConv can extract enriched features for effective point cloud analysis. We show that CKConv has great applicability to point cloud processing tasks including object classification, object part segmentation, and scene semantic segmentation with state-of-the-art results.",0
"CKConv: Learning Feature Voxelization for Point Cloud Analysis presents a novel approach for converting high-resolution point cloud data into volumetric representations that can be used by computer vision algorithms.

Experiments on a diverse set of benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy and robustness against input resolution. Overall, we believe that CKConv has significant potential for advancing research in computer vision and robotics applications where high-quality point cloud analysis is crucial. -----",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exploded onto the machine learning scene in recent years owing to their capability to model and learn from graph-structured data. Such an ability has strong implications in a wide variety of fields whose data is inherently relational, for which conventional neural networks do not perform well. Indeed, as recent reviews can attest, research in the area of GNNs has grown rapidly and has lead to the development of a variety of GNN algorithm variants as well as to the exploration of groundbreaking applications in chemistry, neurology, electronics, or communication networks, among others. At the current stage of research, however, the efficient processing of GNNs is still an open challenge for several reasons. Besides of their novelty, GNNs are hard to compute due to their dependence on the input graph, their combination of dense and very sparse operations, or the need to scale to huge graphs in some applications. In this context, this paper aims to make two main contributions. On the one hand, a review of the field of GNNs is presented from the perspective of computing. This includes a brief tutorial on the GNN fundamentals, an overview of the evolution of the field in the last decade, and a summary of operations carried out in the multiple phases of different GNN algorithm variants. On the other hand, an in-depth analysis of current software and hardware acceleration schemes is provided, from which a hardware-software, graph-aware, and communication-centric vision for GNN accelerators is distilled.",0
"Abstract:  The rapid increase in the size of graph data sets has fueled interest in developing fast and efficient methods for computing graph neural networks (GNN). These models can effectively capture complex relationships among nodes in graphs but their training demands significant computational resources due to iterative nature of GNN computation. In addition to the high resource consumption, there have been several advancements in both hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs specifically designed to perform tensor operations that power machine learning applications including those based on GNNs. In recent years, numerous efforts have focused on proposing novel algorithms for scaling up GNN inference, and further optimizing existing architectures by leveraging these hardware accelerators. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress made in designing algorithms and mapping them onto various acceleration platforms. We first present an introduction to the basics of deep learning on graphs, followed by a detailed description of popular GNN model architectures. Next we elaborate on two important components of GNN computations - feature propagation and aggregation, along with the associated scalability challenges. Finally, we discuss the most promising directions towards addressing these challenges via specialized hardware and algorithmic techniques. We hope that our review will serve as a reference guide for researchers interested in exploring opportunities within this exciting interdisciplinary field.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success as a framework for deep learning on graph-structured data. However, GNNs are fundamentally limited by their tree-structured inductive bias: the WL-subtree kernel formulation bounds the representational capacity of GNNs, and polynomial-time GNNs are provably incapable of recognizing triangles in a graph. In this work, we propose to augment the GNN message-passing operations with information defined on ego graphs (i.e., the induced subgraph surrounding each node). We term these approaches Ego-GNNs and show that Ego-GNNs are provably more powerful than standard message-passing GNNs. In particular, we show that Ego-GNNs are capable of recognizing closed triangles, which is essential given the prominence of transitivity in real-world graphs. We also motivate our approach from the perspective of graph signal processing as a form of multiplex graph convolution. Experimental results on node classification using synthetic and real data highlight the achievable performance gains using this approach.",0
"Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved tremendous success in handling complex graph structured data. However, these models ignore certain types of dependencies existing within graphs such as ego structures, which can significantly affect their performance on downstream tasks. To address this problem, we propose Ego-GNNs - a novel approach that explicitly considers ego structures in GNN architecture by extending each node’s neighborhood to include itself. Our proposed method introduces an additional degree of freedom in learning representations for nodes, enabling the model to capture essential first-order proximity relationships within ego structures. We evaluate our approach across diverse benchmark datasets comprising social networks, knowledge graphs, and bioinformatics domains. Results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating ego structures into Graph Neural Network architectures. Additionally, we present qualitative analyses and ablation studies to further substantiate the benefits offered by our methodology. This study advances our understanding of capturing local and global contextual information in Graph Neural Networks, paving the way for improved applications ranging from recommender systems, fraud detection, drug discovery, etc.",1
"Graph representation learning plays a vital role in processing graph-structured data. However, prior arts on graph representation learning heavily rely on labeling information. To overcome this problem, inspired by the recent success of graph contrastive learning and Siamese networks in visual representation learning, we propose a novel self-supervised approach in this paper to learn node representations by enhancing Siamese self-distillation with multi-scale contrastive learning. Specifically, we first generate two augmented views from the input graph based on local and global perspectives. Then, we employ two objectives called cross-view and cross-network contrastiveness to maximize the agreement between node representations across different views and networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform empirical experiments on five real-world datasets. Our method not only achieves new state-of-the-art results but also surpasses some semi-supervised counterparts by large margins. Code is made available at https://github.com/GRAND-Lab/MERIT",0
"Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNN) have led to significant improvements in graph data representation learning, particularly in unsupervised domain. However, most existing methods perform well only on homogeneous graphs where each node has the same type or class label and limited attention has been given towards heterogeneous graphs which contain nodes belonging from multiple classes. In this work we introduce a new contrastive learning approach that enables multi-scale neighborhood reasoning and improves self-supervised learning performance. Our proposed method is a Siamese network architecture designed to capture high level semantic representations at different scales, enabling it to generalize better across domains. We evaluated our model on four benchmark datasets consisting of both homogenous as well as heterogeneous graphs against state-of-the art competitors, showing marked improvement in accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. Overall, our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of utilizing multi-scale contrastive learning for self-supervised graph representation learning across diverse graph domains.  This paper presents the use of multi-scale contrastive learning in self-supervised graph representation learning. Recently there has been progress in applying graph neural networks for learning graph structures but current approaches often struggle with graph classification tasks. This research proposes the use of a Siamese network which models the high-level relationship between two graphs and leverages this to build up graph embeddings. With the goal to improve upon current self-supervised learning techniques for graph representation, they demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework using four real world graph datasets. Their contributions outperform previous state-of-the-art results indicating the merit of the proposed methodology. By enhancing graph representation learning in a self-supevised manner, future applications could leverage these more accurate learned graph embeddings for improved downstream prediction tasks.",1
"Recent achievements in end-to-end deep learning have encouraged the exploration of tasks dealing with highly structured data with unified deep network models. Having such models for compressing audio signals has been challenging since it requires discrete representations that are not easy to train with end-to-end backpropagation. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning approach that combines recurrent neural networks (RNNs) within the training strategy of variational autoencoders (VAEs) with a binary representation of the latent space. We apply a reparametrization trick for the Bernoulli distribution for the discrete representations, which allows smooth backpropagation. In addition, our approach allows the separation of the encoder and decoder, which is necessary for compression tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first end-to-end learning for a single audio compression model with RNNs, and our model achieves a Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR) of 20.54.",0
"This paper proposes using deep neural networks (DNN) for end-to-end learning to achieve high quality audio compression at low bitrates. We evaluate our approach on popular music datasets such as MIDI and WavNet and show that DNNs can outperform traditional methods like linear prediction coding and discrete cosine transform coding in terms of both objective metrics like signal fidelity and subjective human listening tests. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using end-to-end learned models for low bitrate audio compression while maintaining high audio quality and preserving important musical characteristics. Additionally, we discuss potential future directions for improving these systems even further. Finally, we provide extensive experimental results including comparisons against state-of-the-art audio codecs like Opus and FLAC. Ultimately, our work shows great promise towards achieving highly efficient, high quality audio encoding via deep learning approaches.",1
"Graph convolutional networks are becoming indispensable for deep learning from graph-structured data. Most of the existing graph convolutional networks share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function. In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which only work as low-pass filters.",0
"New models have been developed that use graph convolution filters automatically learned from data, which can provide performance better than traditional manual design methods. We propose herein a novel approach to image processing on graphs using these automatic filters learned by a GCN architecture; we call it the 'Graph Convolutional Neural Operator'. By taking advantage of automated filtering techniques through our methodology, significant performance improvements are realized over existing low pass filter approaches, with comparisons made to current state-of-the art image processing architectures like ResNet and DenseUNet. With real world image datasets considered, results show that our proposed model outperforms competing models. As such, our work sets a new standard for future image processing research within the domain of graph signal analysis.",1
"Multi-relational graph is a ubiquitous and important data structure, allowing flexible representation of multiple types of interactions and relations between entities. Similar to other graph-structured data, link prediction is one of the most important tasks on multi-relational graphs and is often used for knowledge completion. When related graphs coexist, it is of great benefit to build a larger graph via integrating the smaller ones. The integration requires predicting hidden relational connections between entities belonged to different graphs (inter-domain link prediction). However, this poses a real challenge to existing methods that are exclusively designed for link prediction between entities of the same graph only (intra-domain link prediction). In this study, we propose a new approach to tackle the inter-domain link prediction problem by softly aligning the entity distributions between different domains with optimal transport and maximum mean discrepancy regularizers. Experiments on real-world datasets show that optimal transport regularizer is beneficial and considerably improves the performance of baseline methods.",0
"This paper focuses on inter-domain multi-relational link prediction (IMLP), which involves predicting links that exist across multiple domains and relationships within these domains. IMLP has important applications in fields such as recommendation systems, social network analysis, and natural language processing. However, existing approaches have limited performance because they rely solely on intra-domain relationships, ignore important contextual factors, or require large amounts of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on embedding learning and deep neural networks. Our method can effectively capture complex relational dependencies among different entities by utilizing inter-domain knowledge transfer through pre-training. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. We discuss potential future directions and the importance of IMLP research. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward towards building more intelligent and effective information systems.",1
"Graph representation learning has attracted a surge of interest recently, whose target at learning discriminant embedding for each node in the graph. Most of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily depend on label information. However, annotating graphs are expensive to obtain in the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it needs the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To approach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution for graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Graph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation of graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error, while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant representation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to preserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data simultaneously. Extensive experiments indicate MLGCL achieves promising results compared with the existing state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods on seven datasets.",0
"This study introduces a novel method for multi-level graph contrastive learning, which involves representing graphs as matrices and using these representations to learn from differences across levels within each graph. Our approach uses a combination of matrix factorization techniques and random walks on graphs to extract features that capture both local and global structure. We then train a deep neural network on pairs of positive examples (i.e., corresponding nodes at different levels) and negative examples (i.e., non-corresponding nodes), leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data to enforce consistency across multiple levels of abstraction. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous approaches for graph representation learning, including both linear and nonlinear models. Additionally, we showcase the utility of our learned representations by applying them to downstream node classification tasks and achieving strong results. Overall, our work advances the state of art in graph neural networks and underscores the importance of developing novel methods for multi-level contrastive learning.",1
"Various non-trivial spaces are becoming popular for embedding structured data such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces, more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration. Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup, where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be significant in large-scale applications.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to representing graphs compactly while still preserving important structural properties such as connectivity and clustering coefficient. Our method leverages overlapping spaces, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of graph data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on real world datasets, showing that we can achieve significant improvements in both space utilization and query time compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, our method has applications in many areas including database systems, machine learning, and network analysis. By providing a more concise representation of complex graphs, we enable faster processing times and improved scalability for large scale data analysis tasks.",1
"Relational databases are the de facto standard for storing and querying structured data, and extracting insights from structured data requires advanced analytics. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved super-human prediction performance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may not produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is that there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute values in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be easily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is combinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore, the deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also highlighted the need for interpretability, especially for high-stakes applications, which remains another issue of concern to DNNs.   In this paper, we present ARM-Net, an adaptive relation modeling network tailored for structured data, and a lightweight framework ARMOR based on ARM-Net for relational data analytics. The key idea is to model feature interactions with cross features selectively and dynamically, by first transforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining the interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross feature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate the interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model cross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively. Then during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used for each prediction for higher accuracy and better interpretability. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ARM-Net consistently outperforms existing models and provides more interpretable predictions for data-driven decision making.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated promising results for data modeling tasks. However, most existing models were trained without considering relationships among structured elements (e.g., human relations from knowledge graphs) which can provide valuable insights into downstream applications. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called ARM-Net that incorporates adaptive relation modeling across layers.  Our model first learns to encode rich features using a preliminary layer then processes them through multiple adaptation layers that refine representations based on relational signals. By integrating these two parts, our method balances the need for efficient feature extraction and targeted relationship mining. Experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins while offering better interpretability due to its modular design. We hope that our work encourages future research exploring more complex interactions within structured data.",1
We propose a model for hierarchical structured data as an extension to the stochastic temporal convolutional network. The proposed model combines an autoregressive model with a hierarchical variational autoencoder and downsampling to achieve superior computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed model on two different types of sequential data: speech and handwritten text. The results are promising with the proposed model achieving state-of-the-art performance.,0
"Deep learning has revolutionized numerous fields by providing powerful tools that can automatically learn complex patterns from raw data. In particular, deep neural networks have proven highly successful at modeling sequential dependencies in time-series data. However, most datasets consist not just of individual points but rather high-dimensional hierarchies where each level exhibits some form of temporal structure. For example, climate records come as grids in both space and time. Hierarchical structures like these pose unique challenges for machine learning due to their intricate relationships. We present methods for training deep autoregressive (AR) models on hierarchically structured data through two key innovations: weight sharing and dilated convolutions. These modifications allow our network to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics while leveraging abundant supervision found in coarser levels during fine-scale prediction. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement over strong baselines across multiple domains, including large-scale atmospheric science simulations and geospatial satellite imagery analysis tasks. By unlocking the ability to effectively model sequential and spatial hierarchy jointly via deep AR models, we open doors towards tackling many other real-world problems requiring similar representation power.",1
"Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message passing.",0
"In recent years, representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. One important aspect of representation learning is how to effectively capture structural relationships among data points, which can greatly enhance the performance of downstream models. Hypergraphs offer a more expressive framework than graphs to represent these structures due to their capability of handling multiple edge types and varying degrees of connectedness. This paper presents an approach that leverages hypergraph representations to improve the quality of learned embeddings and significantly boost the performance on several benchmark datasets. Our method adopts random walks over hypergraphs to efficiently encode local neighborhood contexts while utilizing meta paths to integrate global structure information into the process. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods on several tasks, including node classification, link prediction, clustering, and question answering. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-quality embeddings, achieving superior performance across all evaluated benchmarks, and offering improved interpretability through hypergraph visualization techniques.

"In the world where big data reigns and there is plenty of hardware prepared to gather a huge amount of non structured data, data acquisition is no longer a problem. Surveillance cameras are ubiquitous and they capture huge numbers of people walking across different scenes. However, extracting value from this data is challenging, specially for tasks that involve human images, such as face recognition and person re-identification. Annotation of this kind of data is a challenging and expensive task. In this work we propose a domain adaptation workflow to allow CNNs that were trained in one domain to be applied to another domain without the need for new annotation of the target data. Our method uses AlignedReID++ as the baseline, trained using a Triplet loss with batch hard. Domain adaptation is done by using pseudo-labels generated using an unsupervised learning strategy. Our results show that domain adaptation techniques really improve the performance of the CNN when applied in the target domain.",0
"Title: ""Domain Adaptation for Person Re-Identification Using AlignedReID++""  Abstract: One of the key challenges facing person re-identification (Re-Id) algorithms is domain shift, which refers to differences in camera parameters, scene layouts, and lighting conditions between source and target domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes AlignedReID++, a pre-trained deep learning model designed specifically for Re-Id tasks. Our method leverages the power of transfer learning and fine-tuning to adapt existing models to new, unlabelled data from different domains. By aligning feature representations across multiple datasets through knowledge distillation, our algorithm can effectively learn more robust features while preserving identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in rank-1 accuracy and mAP metrics. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of person Re-Id, helping overcome domain shift issues in practice.",1
"In representation learning on the graph-structured data, under heterophily (or low homophily), many popular GNNs may fail to capture long-range dependencies, which leads to their performance degradation. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we propose a graph convolutional networks with structure learning (GCN-SL), and furthermore, the proposed approach can be applied to node classification. The proposed GCN-SL contains two improvements: corresponding to node features and edges, respectively. In the aspect of node features, we propose an efficient-spectral-clustering (ESC) and an ESC with anchors (ESC-ANCH) algorithms to efficiently aggregate feature representations from all similar nodes. In the aspect of edges, we build a re-connected adjacency matrix by using a special data preprocessing technique and similarity learning, and the re-connected adjacency matrix can be optimized directly along with GCN-SL parameters. Considering that the original adjacency matrix may provide misleading information for aggregation in GCN, especially the graphs being with a low level of homophily. The proposed GCN-SL can aggregate feature representations from nearby nodes via re-connected adjacency matrix and is applied to graphs with various levels of homophily. Experimental results on a wide range of benchmark datasets illustrate that the proposed GCN-SL outperforms the stateof-the-art GNN counterparts.",0
"Title: ""Graph Neural Networks with Structure Learning""  Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to graph convolutional networks (GCN) called GCN-SL that incorporates structure learning into the network architecture. In many real-world applications, graphs exhibit heterophily, meaning that different nodes have varying degrees of connectivity and can belong to multiple communities simultaneously. Existing GCN methods assume homophilous graphs where each node belongs to only one community, which limits their ability to capture complex relationships in heterophilous graphs.  To address this limitation, we propose a novel methodology to learn the optimal weights for both intra-layer and inter-layer connections in the GCN model by leveraging structural priors, such as degree distribution and community membership probabilities. We demonstrate that our proposed method improves performance over state-of-the-art baseline models on several benchmark datasets including Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. Our experimental results show that the learned weights adapt well to various types of data distributions and are able to extract more accurate representations of graph structures even with limited training samples. Overall, our work represents a significant advance towards building more robust GCN architectures that can handle challenging heterophilous graphs commonly found in the wild.",1
"Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged with promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its counterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data augmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to be in general aligned with previous ""best practices"" observed from handcrafted tuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we propose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route output features through different projection heads corresponding to different augmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on augmentation selection. We release the code at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL_Automated.",0

"Data augmentation is a key element of deep learning pipelines, as it informs the network during training about transformations of the input data that keep the label unchanged. Manually finding adequate augmentation methods and parameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular, while intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of augmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as neuroscience signals. Moreover, label independent strategies might not be suitable for such structured data and class-dependent augmentations might be necessary. This idea has been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, while it is quite intuitive: changing the color of a car image does not change the object class to be predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange does. This paper aims to increase the generalization power added through class-wise data augmentation. Yet, as seeking transformations depending on the class largely increases the complexity of the task, using gradient-free optimization techniques as done by most existing automatic approaches becomes intractable for real-world datasets. For this reason we propose to use differentiable data augmentation amenable to gradient-based learning. EEG signals are a perfect example of data for which good augmentation policies are mostly unknown. In this work, we demonstrate the relevance of our approach on the clinically relevant sleep staging classification task, for which we also propose differentiable transformations.",0
"Data augmentation has emerged as a popular technique for improving machine learning models by increasing their training set size. However, traditional data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling may not be suitable for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals due to specific characteristics such as sensor placement and signal frequency content. This study introduces a novel class-wise automatic differentiable data augmentation (CADDA) method specifically designed for EEG signals. CADDA uses a twofold approach that includes time-domain and frequency-domain transformations. Time-domain transformations involve shuffling and permutating the order of sample points within each epoch, while frequency-domain transformations include adjusting amplitude values along different frequency bands using trigonometric functions. Both types of transformation operations were made compatible with gradient descent via auto-differentiation tools available in deep learning frameworks. Experiments showed improved generalization performance across several classification tasks compared to standard augmentations and no augmentation. CADDA also exhibited superior results over other state-of-the art methods. Therefore, our proposed approach represents a significant contribution to the field of EEG signal processing and machine learning. In conclusion, CADDA provides a new tool for researchers and practitioners working on EEG applications to enhance model accuracy without requiring large amounts of labeled data.",1
"Temporal graph signals are multivariate time series with individual components associated with nodes of a fixed graph structure. Data of this kind arises in many domains including activity of social network users, sensor network readings over time, and time course gene expression within the interaction network of a model organism. Traditional matrix decomposition methods applied to such data fall short of exploiting structural regularities encoded in the underlying graph and also in the temporal patterns of the signal. How can we take into account such structure to obtain a succinct and interpretable representation of temporal graph signals?   We propose a general, dictionary-based framework for temporal graph signal decomposition (TGSD). The key idea is to learn a low-rank, joint encoding of the data via a combination of graph and time dictionaries. We propose a highly scalable decomposition algorithm for both complete and incomplete data, and demonstrate its advantage for matrix decomposition, imputation of missing values, temporal interpolation, clustering, period estimation, and rank estimation in synthetic and real-world data ranging from traffic patterns to social media activity. Our framework achieves 28% reduction in RMSE compared to baselines for temporal interpolation when as many as 75% of the observations are missing. It scales best among baselines taking under 20 seconds on 3.5 million data points and produces the most parsimonious models. To the best of our knowledge, TGSD is the first framework to jointly model graph signals by temporal and graph dictionaries.",0
"Here is an example abstract:  A key challenge in analyzing graph signals is their intrinsic high dimensionality. In practice these signals often admit a natural decomposition into simpler components that can then be interpreted by domain experts. This article introduces a novel method called temporal graph signal decomposition (TGSD) which extends traditional graph signal processing techniques to accommodate time varying signals. TGSD builds on spectral clustering methods and is motivated by recent results from algebraic signal processing related to sparse representations of multi-dimensional signals using graphs. We describe the TGSD framework and demonstrate through numerical examples how it can reveal structure in a variety of synthetic and real data sets that cannot be easily seen otherwise. These applications span social networks, biological networks, and sensor network data where we show that our approach leads to meaningful insights and interpretations of the underlying system dynamics.",1
"We introduce the Graph Mixture Density Networks, a new family of machine learning models that can fit multimodal output distributions conditioned on graphs of arbitrary topology. By combining ideas from mixture models and graph representation learning, we address a broader class of challenging conditional density estimation problems that rely on structured data. In this respect, we evaluate our method on a new benchmark application that leverages random graphs for stochastic epidemic simulations. We show a significant improvement in the likelihood of epidemic outcomes when taking into account both multimodality and structure. The empirical analysis is complemented by two real-world regression tasks showing the effectiveness of our approach in modeling the output prediction uncertainty. Graph Mixture Density Networks open appealing research opportunities in the study of structure-dependent phenomena that exhibit non-trivial conditional output distributions.",0

"Hypergraphs are used to model higher-order interactions amongst agents and there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To enable efficient processing of hypergraph-structured data, several hypergraph neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties and structure, with a special focus on node classification. However, almost all existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal performance on many datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently learned for each task and each dataset. Furthermore, AllSet draws on new connections between hypergraph neural networks and recent advances in deep learning of multiset functions. In particular, the proposed architecture utilizes Deep Sets and Set Transformer architectures that allow for significant modeling flexibility and offer high expressive power. To evaluate the performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The results demonstrate that AllSet has the unique ability to consistently either match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested datasets. Our implementation and dataset will be released upon acceptance.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNN) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships among entities, where each entity can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. However, most existing frameworks focus on handling binary attributes, which limits their expressiveness and applicability in real-world scenarios involving multi-label data. To address this limitation, we propose AllSet, a novel multiset function framework that extends HNN by allowing edges to represent any number of elements within different sets. With AllSet, our models learn more generalized features, enabling better performance across tasks while reducing the risk of overfitting. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to traditional binary HNNs and other multi-labeled baselines. Overall, AllSet provides a simple yet effective solution for efficient representation learning, expanding HNN capabilities towards more complex multi-set patterns.",1
"Deep neural networks, while generalize well, are known to be sensitive to small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models. With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad actors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them. Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\% for GCN and other three models.",0
"This paper presents a study on universal adversarial attacks (UAA) that target graph learning models such as GNNs. UAAs aim to find small perturbations that can fool any classifier regardless of model architecture and input space. Our contributions show that only a few bad actors in the graph cause significant degradation in accuracy for these classifiers. We evaluate two popular attack methods, Sparse PCA and DeepFool, which perform well even against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. In addition, we propose a new attack algorithm based on iterative edge removal that outperforms existing methods by more effectively utilizing the limited number of adversarial edges available during inference. Lastly, we discuss potential applications of our work towards improving robustness and reliability of real-world systems that employ graph learning techniques.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been extensively used for mining graph-structured data with impressive performance. However, traditional GNNs suffer from over-smoothing, non-robustness and over-fitting problems. To solve these weaknesses, we design a novel GNN solution, namely Graph Attention Network with LSTM-based Path Reweighting (PR-GAT). PR-GAT can automatically aggregate multi-hop information, highlight important paths and filter out noises. In addition, we utilize random path sampling in PR-GAT for data augmentation. The augmented data is used for predicting the distribution of corresponding labels. Finally, we demonstrate that PR-GAT can mitigate the issues of over-smoothing, non-robustness and overfitting. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on 5 out of 7 datasets and competitive accuracy for other 2 datasets. The average accuracy of 7 datasets have been improved by 0.5\% than the best SOTA from literature.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for improving attention mechanisms in graph neural networks (GNN) using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units. GNNs have shown great success in many applications ranging from natural language processing to computer vision; however, they still suffer from limitations such as oversmoothing effects where node representations become homogeneous across layers. To address this challenge, we propose Graph Attention Networks with LSTM-based Path Reweighting (GAT+), which reweights attention paths based on their importance derived from node features and learned by a separate path selection subnetwork built with LSTMs. Our proposed method enhances attentiveness towards important nodes while preserving crucial structural relationships among them, thus achieving better performance than existing methods. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different components of our design on results, demonstrating that GAT+ indeed captures long-term dependencies effectively. Overall, our work makes a meaningful contribution to the field of graph machine learning and paves the way for future research on enhancing attention models in GNNs.",1
"This paper presents a new approach for assembling graph neural networks based on framelet transforms. The latter provides a multi-scale representation for graph-structured data. We decompose an input graph into low-pass and high-pass frequencies coefficients for network training, which then defines a framelet-based graph convolution. The framelet decomposition naturally induces a graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and high-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the graph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with the proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art performance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose shrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds high-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage activation improves model performance on denoising and signal compression: noises in both node and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately cutting off the high-pass coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the signal can be compressed to less than half its original size with well-preserved prediction performance.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing structured data such as graphs, networks, and trees.

This paper presents experimental results showing how incorporating framelets into GNN architectures leads to significant improvements in accuracy and stability across multiple datasets and tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that our methodology effectively reduces the sensitivity of the models to input perturbations while achieving better generalization on unseen test sets compared to state-of-the-art GNN approaches. Our findings suggest that framelet augmentation represents a promising new direction for advancing the field of graph learning.",1
"The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.",0
"This paper examines the performance of transformer models on graph representation tasks and finds that they may not perform as well as previously thought. While transformers have proven successful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their ability to handle complex graph structures has been less thoroughly evaluated. To investigate this gap, we conduct experiments using several popular datasets and baseline models, comparing traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) with state-of-the-art transformer architectures like GPT-2 and T5. Our results show that while some transformer models can achieve competitive results on simpler graph problems, they tend to underperform compared to GNNs on more complex data, where knowledge about structure and topology is crucial. We conclude by discussing potential reasons behind these findings and proposing future research directions towards enhancing the capabilities of transformers for handling graphs.",1
"Graphs are versatile tools for representing structured data. As a result, a variety of machine learning methods have been studied for graph data analysis. Although many such learning methods depend on the measurement of differences between input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for graphs remains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric learning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a subgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each subgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can provide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is also proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a transportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the computational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several benchmark datasets and provide some illustrative examples of how IGML identifies important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.",0
"Here's an example of an abstract for ""Distance Metric Learning for Graph Structured Data"":  The problem of graph structured data arises frequently in many applications such as image processing, natural language processing, social network analysis, etc. Traditional methods for learning a distance metric on graphs rely heavily on handcrafted features which often lead to suboptimal results. This work proposes a deep learning based method that learns a neural network model capable of predicting pairwise distances directly from raw input tensors. Our proposed algorithm adopts a contrastive loss function for supervised training and can also incorporate additional unsupervised regularization terms, leading to improved performance compared to competitive baseline methods. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our approach across multiple application domains including visual correspondence search, node classification, and clustering tasks, validating the generality of our framework. Additionally, we analyze different components of our algorithm and provide theoretical insights into why our method works well in practice.",1
"An outlier is an observation or a data point that is far from rest of the data points in a given dataset or we can be said that an outlier is away from the center of mass of observations. Presence of outliers can skew statistical measures and data distributions which can lead to misleading representation of the underlying data and relationships. It is seen that the removal of outliers from the training dataset before modeling can give better predictions. With the advancement of machine learning, the outlier detection models are also advancing at a good pace. The goal of this work is to highlight and compare some of the existing outlier detection techniques for the data scientists to use that information for outlier algorithm selection while building a machine learning model.",0
"In recent years, outlier detection has become increasingly important due to the abundance of structured data available in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and business. Traditional unsupervised learning methods have been used to identify outliers but they often lack sufficient accuracy. This study evaluates three commonly used outlier detection techniques: local outlier factor (LOF), one-class SVMs, and isolation forest (IF). We assess their performance on benchmark datasets, comparing each method’s effectiveness at identifying both known outliers and unknown anomalies in structured data. Our results show that LOF consistently achieves high precision and recall rates, while IF performs better than traditional classifiers like support vector machines. Additionally, we found that combining multiple algorithms can improve overall outlier detection accuracy. Our research concludes by recommending appropriate usage scenarios for each technique based on specific application requirements.",1
"The spatio-temporal graph learning is becoming an increasingly important object of graph study. Many application domains involve highly dynamic graphs where temporal information is crucial, e.g. traffic networks and financial transaction graphs. Despite the constant progress made on learning structured data, there is still a lack of effective means to extract dynamic complex features from spatio-temporal structures. Particularly, conventional models such as convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks are incapable of revealing the temporal patterns in short or long terms and exploring the spatial properties in local or global scope from spatio-temporal graphs simultaneously. To tackle this problem, we design a novel multi-scale architecture, Spatio-Temporal U-Net (ST-UNet), for graph-structured time series modeling. In this U-shaped network, a paired sampling operation is proposed in spacetime domain accordingly: the pooling (ST-Pool) coarsens the input graph in spatial from its deterministic partition while abstracts multi-resolution temporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on previous settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the original structure of spatio-temporal graphs and resumes regular intervals within graph sequences. Experiments on spatio-temporal prediction tasks demonstrate that our model effectively captures comprehensive features in multiple scales and achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods on several real-world datasets.",0
"In order to achieve state of art results in graph structured time series modeling we propose new architecture called ST-Unet. By utilizing both spatial and temporal context our network can outperform other methods by significant margin. Unlike traditional architectures that use only one type of convolutions we have two main branches - Spatial branch that captures static features and Temporal branch that encodes temporal dependencies between consecutive input samples. This design enables us to learn fine grained spatiotemporal representation which in turn leads to better performance on benchmark datasets like M4, BAQ, SARCOS, and UTIAOD. We provide ablation study that demonstrates importance of each component as well as comparison against strong baselines such as GCN, LSTM, TCN and several others popular models. Finally we provide extensive analysis of learned representations using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method showing that our learned embeddings contain meaningful information and capture underlying structure of data. Overall this work presents important contribution in graph structured deep learning area and provides future research directions in this exciting domain.",1
"The Wasserstein distance provides a notion of dissimilarities between probability measures, which has recent applications in learning of structured data with varying size such as images and text documents. In this work, we analyze the $k$-nearest neighbor classifier ($k$-NN) under the Wasserstein distance and establish the universal consistency on families of distributions. Using previous known results on the consistency of the $k$-NN classifier on infinite dimensional metric spaces, it suffices to show that the families is a countable union of finite dimension sets. As a result, we show that the $k$-NN classifier is universally consistent on spaces of finitely supported measures, the space of Gaussian measures, and the space of measures with finite wavelet densities. In addition, we give a counterexample to show that the universal consistency does not hold on $\mathcal{W}_p((0,1))$.",0
"This paper investigates the theoretical properties of the Wasserstein $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($W_k$NN) algorithm, which has recently emerged as a promising approach to nonparametric classification tasks. We prove that under mild assumptions, the Bayes error rate can always be achieved by selecting a sufficiently large value of k. Moreover, we show that the choice of k that achieves universality depends only on the underlying probability distribution and the metric space structure of the data. These results provide insight into the design and selection of $W_k$NN algorithms for different applications and shed light on their relationship to other popular distance-based methods such as $\epsilon$-$k$NN and kernel density estimators. Overall, our findings indicate that $W_k$NN offers a flexible and powerful alternative for nonparametric regression and classification problems while maintaining strong statistical guarantees.",1
"Recent years have witnessed tremendous interest in deep learning on graph-structured data. Due to the high cost of collecting labeled graph-structured data, domain adaptation is important to supervised graph learning tasks with limited samples. However, current graph domain adaptation methods are generally adopted from traditional domain adaptation tasks, and the properties of graph-structured data are not well utilized. For example, the observed social networks on different platforms are controlled not only by the different crowd or communities but also by the domain-specific policies and the background noise. Based on these properties in graph-structured data, we first assume that the graph-structured data generation process is controlled by three independent types of latent variables, i.e., the semantic latent variables, the domain latent variables, and the random latent variables. Based on this assumption, we propose a disentanglement-based unsupervised domain adaptation method for the graph-structured data, which applies variational graph auto-encoders to recover these latent variables and disentangles them via three supervised learning modules. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets in the graph classification task reveal that our method not only significantly outperforms the traditional domain adaptation methods and the disentangled-based domain adaptation methods but also outperforms the state-of-the-art graph domain adaptation algorithms.",0

Additionally, we provide qualitative analyses of the generated data to validate that the method creates meaningful representations that better capture underlying structure across tasks. This research has applications in industries where fast adaptation to changing conditions is crucial, including robotics, medical diagnostics, and self-driving vehicles.",1
"While the advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has greatly improved node and graph representation learning in many applications, the neighborhood aggregation scheme exposes additional vulnerabilities to adversaries seeking to extract node-level information about sensitive attributes. In this paper, we study the problem of protecting sensitive attributes by information obfuscation when learning with graph structured data. We propose a framework to locally filter out pre-determined sensitive attributes via adversarial training with the total variation and the Wasserstein distance. Our method creates a strong defense against inference attacks, while only suffering small loss in task performance. Theoretically, we analyze the effectiveness of our framework against a worst-case adversary, and characterize an inherent trade-off between maximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing information leakage. Experiments across multiple datasets from recommender systems, knowledge graphs and quantum chemistry demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a robust defense across various graph structures and tasks, while producing competitive GNN encoders for downstream tasks.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing structured data represented as graphs.

Our approach involves adding noise to edge weights and node degrees based on their importance to downstream tasks, as well as utilizing adversarial training to further disrupt inference of sensitive attributes. Empirical evaluation shows that our method effectively reduces information leakage without significantly affecting predictive accuracy across several benchmark datasets and application domains. Overall, our work demonstrates a promising direction toward enhancing privacy preservation in GNNs while maintaining strong model performance.",1
"Link prediction is an important learning task for graph-structured data. In this paper, we propose a novel topological approach to characterize interactions between two nodes.

Here we introduce a novel algorithm based on persistent homology that can predict links by extracting intrinsic topological features from complex network datasets. We further enhance our approach with interactive visualizations designed to enable users to interactively explore predicted links, observe their effect on persistence diagrams, and analyze how different parameters affect link predictions. Our experimental results demonstrate both the accuracy of our method as well as the usability of our interface. This work holds significance in providing new insights into data analysis beyond traditional feature extraction techniques and opening up future research directions at the intersection of algebraic topology, computer graphics, and data science.",1
"Deep neural networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in power systems, ranging from pattern recognition to signal processing.

"HyperGraph Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCNNs) have demonstrated their potential in modeling high-order relations preserved in graph structured data. However, most existing convolution filters are localized and determined by the pre-defined initial hypergraph topology, neglecting to explore implicit and long-ange relations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose the first learning-based method tailored for constructing adaptive hypergraph structure, termed HypERgrAph Laplacian aDaptor (HERALD), which serves as a generic plug-in-play module for improving the representational power of HGCNNs. Specifically, HERALD adaptively optimizes the adjacency relationship between hypernodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on various popular hypergraph datasets for node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our approach obtains consistent and considerable performance enhancement, proving its effectiveness and generalization ability.",0

"Supervised machine learning has several drawbacks that make it difficult to use in many situations. Drawbacks include: heavy reliance on massive training data, limited generalizability and poor expressiveness of high-level semantics. Low-shot Learning attempts to address these drawbacks. Low-shot learning allows the model to obtain good predictive power with very little or no training data, where structured knowledge plays a key role as a high-level semantic representation of human. This article will review the fundamental factors of low-shot learning technologies, with a focus on the operation of structured knowledge under different low-shot conditions.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one of the most popular approaches to using deep learning on graph-structured data, and they have shown state-of-the-art performances on a variety of tasks. However, according to a recent study, a careful choice of pooling functions, which are used for the aggregation or readout operation in GNNs, is crucial for enabling GNNs to extrapolate. Without the ideal combination of pooling functions, which varies across tasks, GNNs completely fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, while the number of possible combinations grows exponentially with the number of layers. In this paper, we present GNP, a $L^p$ norm-like pooling function that is trainable end-to-end for any given task. Notably, GNP generalizes most of the widely-used pooling functions. We verify experimentally that simply replacing all pooling functions with GNP enables GNNs to extrapolate well on many node-level, graph-level, and set-related tasks; and GNP sometimes performs even better than optimal combinations of existing pooling functions.",0
"In this work we describe a new method for using graph neural networks (GNN) that can allow them to extrapolate beyond their training data. Our key insight is that GNNs usually learn to aggregate neighborhood information into a fixed size vector, but if they could learn to pool different subsets of nodes then more complex models would become feasible. We show how to train such pooled GNNs, which allows us to build models that can generalize well on many real world datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR, even though our model architecture is very simple. These results may lead to future progress on difficult problems like natural language understanding.",1
"HyperGraph Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCNNs) have demonstrated their potential in modeling high-order relations preserved in graph structured data. However, most existing convolution filters are localized and determined by the pre-defined initial hypergraph topology, neglecting to explore implicit and long-ange relations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose the first learning-based method tailored for constructing adaptive hypergraph structure, termed HypERgrAph Laplacian aDaptor (HERALD), which serves as a generic plug-in-play module for improving the representational power of HGCNNs. Specifically, HERALD adaptively optimizes the adjacency relationship between hypernodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on various popular hypergraph datasets for node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our approach obtains consistent and considerable performance enhancement, proving its effectiveness and generalization ability.",0
"In order to make your job easier I have attached a draft of the abstract. --- Draft Abstract: This work introduces the Learnable Hypergraph Laplacian (LHL), which enables learning on hypergraphs via a parameterized linear algebraic framework. LHL generalizes classical graph Laplacians to allow interactions among multiple nodes, making it well suited for capturing nonlinear dependencies in data. Our method learns a local filtering operator that preserves smoothness while minimizing the rank deficiency of the Hessian matrix to improve optimization efficiency. We demonstrate LHL’s effectiveness by applying our method to several key hypergraph applications including hyperedge replacement problem, image demosaicking, sparse representation and super resolution reconstruction from compressive measurements. Extensive experimental results show that LHL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. ​ The introduction of the Learnable Hypergraph Laplacian (LHL) represents a significant step forward in the field of hypergraph learning. This innovative approach utilizes a parameterized linear algebraic framework to enable more effective capture of nonlinear dependencies in data through generalized interactions among multiple nodes.

"Graph is an usual representation of relational data, which are ubiquitous in manydomains such as molecules, biological and social networks. A popular approach to learningwith graph structured data is to make use of graph kernels, which measure the similaritybetween graphs and are plugged into a kernel machine such as a support vector machine.Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) based graph kernels, which employ WL labeling scheme to extract subtree patterns and perform node embedding, are demonstrated to achieve great performance while being efficiently computable. However, one of the main drawbacks of ageneral kernel is the decoupling of kernel construction and learning process. For moleculargraphs, usual kernels such as WL subtree, based on substructures of the molecules, consider all available substructures having the same importance, which might not be suitable inpractice. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the weights of subtree patterns in the framework of WWL kernels, the state of the art method for graph classification task [14]. To overcome the computational issue on large scale data sets, we present an efficient learning algorithm and also derive a generalization gap bound to show its convergence. Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for learning the weights of subtree patterns.",0
"Graphs have been used as data structures because they can capture both qualitative and quantitative aspects of many real world problems such as chemical compounds and social networks. Since graphs often contain repeating patterns which might not need distinct node labels, labelless graph kernels may learn better representations than their labeled counterparts. In particular, the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (WLK) has recently gained attention as an efficient and effective way to compute pairwise similarities on graphs using only information at a fixed depth of neighborhood. However, since there may exist redundant or irrelevant substructures that could harm WLK performance, we must consider how to determine their significance. This work presents a methodology based on mutual information to estimate the importance of different sized subtrees on graph similarity computation. Our experimental results demonstrate that pruning smaller and less relevant patterns from the feature space leads to improved accuracy across different datasets.",1
"Event forecasting is a challenging, yet important task, as humans seek to constantly plan for the future. Existing automated forecasting studies rely mostly on structured data, such as time-series or event-based knowledge graphs, to help predict future events. In this work, we aim to formulate a task, construct a dataset, and provide benchmarks for developing methods for event forecasting with large volumes of unstructured text data. To simulate the forecasting scenario on temporal news documents, we formulate the problem as a restricted-domain, multiple-choice, question-answering (QA) task. Unlike existing QA tasks, our task limits accessible information, and thus a model has to make a forecasting judgement. To showcase the usefulness of this task formulation, we introduce ForecastQA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 10,392 event forecasting questions, which have been collected and verified via crowdsourcing efforts. We present our experiments on ForecastQA using BERT-based models and find that our best model achieves 60.1% accuracy on the dataset, which still lags behind human performance by about 19%. We hope ForecastQA will support future research efforts in bridging this gap.",0

These challenges span topics such as political violence, disease outbreaks, and natural disasters where timely and accurate forecasts can have significant real-world impacts. Our evaluation process involves crowdsourcing human annotations to determine system outputs ground truth labels which we make publicly available through our website https://forecastqa.com/evaluation. Through these efforts, we aim to foster community engagement in this research area by providing a comprehensive benchmark to compare different approaches and spur progress towards more advanced predictive models.",1
"Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with non-Euclidean structural data. Both spatial-based and spectral-based GNNs are relying on adjacency matrix to guide message passing among neighbors during feature aggregation. Recent works have mainly focused on powerful message passing modules, however, in this paper, we show that none of the message passing modules is necessary. Instead, we propose a pure multilayer-perceptron-based framework, Graph-MLP with the supervision signal leveraging graph structure, which is sufficient for learning discriminative node representation. In model-level, Graph-MLP only includes multi-layer perceptrons, activation function, and layer normalization. In the loss level, we design a neighboring contrastive (NContrast) loss to bridge the gap between GNNs and MLPs by utilizing the adjacency information implicitly. This design allows our model to be lighter and more robust when facing large-scale graph data and corrupted adjacency information. Extensive experiments prove that even without adjacency information in testing phase, our framework can still reach comparable and even superior performance against the state-of-the-art models in the graph node classification task.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for analyzing complex data structures such as graphs. While GNNs can capture rich representations of input data through their message passing mechanisms, these mechanisms can suffer from high computational cost and overfitting due to the large number of parameters involved. To address these issues, we propose Graph-MLP, a novel approach that utilizes MLP layers on each node in a graph instead of performing explicit message passing operations. This allows us to learn effective representations while significantly reducing computation time and preventing overfitting. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets across a variety of domains including social network analysis, computer vision, and biology, and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our findings provide important insights into the potential of MLP-based architectures for graph classification tasks and offer new opportunities for developing more scalable and efficient approaches to deep learning on graph data. Overall, Graph-MLP represents an exciting step forward in the field of graph analytics and offers promising solutions for tackling real-world problems involving complex relational data structures.",1
"Various classes of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been proposed and shown to be successful in a wide range of applications with graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework able to compare the expressive power of these GNN architectures. The current universality theorems only apply to intractable classes of GNNs. Here, we prove the first approximation guarantees for practical GNNs, paving the way for a better understanding of their generalization. Our theoretical results are proved for invariant GNNs computing a graph embedding (permutation of the nodes of the input graph does not affect the output) and equivariant GNNs computing an embedding of the nodes (permutation of the input permutes the output). We show that Folklore Graph Neural Networks (FGNN), which are tensor based GNNs augmented with matrix multiplication are the most expressive architectures proposed so far for a given tensor order. We illustrate our results on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (a NP-Hard combinatorial problem) by showing that FGNNs are able to learn how to solve the problem, leading to much better average performances than existing algorithms (based on spectral, SDP or other GNNs architectures). On a practical side, we also implement masked tensors to handle batches of graphs of varying sizes.",0

"This paper presents Gem, a model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for any GNNs on various graph learning tasks. Specifically, we formulate the problem of providing explanations for the decisions of GNNs as a causal learning task. Then we train a causal explanation model equipped with a loss function based on Granger causality. Different from existing explainers for GNNs, Gem explains GNNs on graph-structured data from a causal perspective. It has better generalization ability as it has no requirements on the internal structure of the GNNs or prior knowledge on the graph learning tasks. In addition, Gem, once trained, can be used to explain the target GNN very quickly. Our theoretical analysis shows that several recent explainers fall into a unified framework of additive feature attribution methods. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that Gem achieves a relative increase of the explanation accuracy by up to $30\%$ and speeds up the explanation process by up to $110\times$ as compared to its state-of-the-art alternatives.",0
"Graph neural networks have gained increasing popularity due to their ability to learn from structured data such as graphs, which are ubiquitous across many application domains. However, interpretability remains one of the primary challenges for these models, particularly when attempting to explain how they arrived at a certain decision.

Our method can generate synthetic counterfactual examples that demonstrate how specific input factors impact model predictions, allowing users to better understand why particular decisions were made. We evaluate our proposed approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating accurate and meaningful explanations of graph neural network behavior. By providing transparency into complex machine learning systems, our method has the potential to enhance trustworthiness and reliability of artificial intelligence applications, ultimately benefiting endusers.",1
"Learning the representation of data with hierarchical structures in the hyperbolic space attracts increasing attention in recent years. Due to the constant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and captures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic embeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many real-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree networks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not ubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To address this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex hyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation learning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically structured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The unit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity to capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the hyperbolic embedding models significantly.",0
"This work presents a new mathematical model for embedding hierarchical structures into complex hyperbolic space. The unit ball model provides a methodology for mapping high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional representations while preserving their structural characteristics. By exploiting the geometry of complex hyperbolic spaces, we demonstrate that our approach results in more accurate embeddings compared to traditional methods such as Euclidean and spherical maps. Our findings have important implications for fields ranging from machine learning to computational neuroscience, where understanding complex hierarchical relationships is essential. In summary, our research contributes to the development of more effective tools for exploring and visualizing high-dimensional datasets.",1
"Imbalanced classification on graphs is ubiquitous yet challenging in many real-world applications, such as fraudulent node detection. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on many network analysis tasks. However, most existing GNNs have almost exclusively focused on the balanced networks, and would get unappealing performance on the imbalanced networks. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a generative adversarial graph network model, called ImGAGN to address the imbalanced classification problem on graphs. It introduces a novel generator for graph structure data, named GraphGenerator, which can simulate both the minority class nodes' attribute distribution and network topological structure distribution by generating a set of synthetic minority nodes such that the number of nodes in different classes can be balanced. Then a graph convolutional network (GCN) discriminator is trained to discriminate between real nodes and fake (i.e., generated) nodes, and also between minority nodes and majority nodes on the synthetic balanced network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world imbalanced network datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method ImGAGN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for semi-supervised imbalanced node classification task.",0
"In recent years, imbalanced learning has become increasingly important in machine learning due to the prevalence of class skewness in many real-world datasets. This paper presents a novel approach to addressing the problem of imbalance through the use of generative adversarial graph networks (GAGN). GAGN can effectively model complex relationships between classes by leveraging both intra-class dependencies as well as inter-class discrimination signals within graphs constructed from features extracted using deep neural networks. Our proposed method, called ""ImGAGN,"" offers several advantages over existing techniques, including improved stability during training, enhanced performance on both majority and minority classes, and applicability across different domains such as image classification, natural language processing, and medical diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and visualization quality metrics. Overall, ImGAGN provides a promising new technique for tackling the challenges posed by class imbalances in modern machine learning applications.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the first choice methods for graph machine learning problems thanks to their ability to learn state-of-the-art level representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to user-side privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial competition. Federated Learning is the de-facto standard for collaborative training of machine learning models over many distributed edge devices without the need for centralization. Nevertheless, training graph neural networks in a federated setting is vaguely defined and brings statistical and systems challenges. This work proposes SpreadGNN, a novel multi-task federated training framework capable of operating in the presence of partial labels and absence of a central server for the first time in the literature. SpreadGNN extends federated multi-task learning to realistic serverless settings for GNNs, and utilizes a novel optimization algorithm with a convergence guarantee, Decentralized Periodic Averaging SGD (DPA-SGD), to solve decentralized multi-task learning problems. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a variety of non-I.I.D. distributed graph-level molecular property prediction datasets with partial labels. Our results show that SpreadGNN outperforms GNN models trained over a central server-dependent federated learning system, even in constrained topologies. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/FedML-AI/SpreadGNN",0

Ultimately, we conclude that SpreadGNN represents a significant step forward in unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of machine learning, networking, computer architecture, security, privacy, and human behavior. By developing powerful algorithms capable of solving complex problems in these areas, we pave the way for achieving truly intelligent technology that can positively impact society as a whole.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used deep learning models that learn meaningful representations from graph-structured data. Due to the finite nature of the underlying recurrent structure, current GNN methods may struggle to capture long-range dependencies in underlying graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a graph learning framework, called Implicit Graph Neural Networks (IGNN), where predictions are based on the solution of a fixed-point equilibrium equation involving implicitly defined ""state"" vectors. We use the Perron-Frobenius theory to derive sufficient conditions that ensure well-posedness of the framework. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we derive a tractable projected gradient descent method to train the framework. Experiments on a comprehensive range of tasks show that IGNNs consistently capture long-range dependencies and outperform the state-of-the-art GNN models.",0
"Abstract: Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have greatly improved their ability to model complex relationships between data points in graphs. However, existing GNN architectures often struggle with capturing implicit relationships that cannot be directly inferred from the node attributes themselves. To address this limitation, we propose Implicit Graph Neural Networks (IGNN), which can learn both explicit and implicit relationships by leveraging techniques like attention mechanisms and meta learning. In our experiments on several benchmark datasets, IGNNs achieved state-of-the-art results and showed significant improvements over traditional GNN architectures in terms of accuracy and interpretability. Our work demonstrates the potential of using implicit relationships in graph neural networks for improving predictions across diverse domains, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. We believe that our research opens new opportunities for developing more powerful models that capture both explicit and implicit dependencies among data points, leading to even better predictive performance and deeper insights into real-world phenomena.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully employed in a myriad of applications involving graph-structured data. Theoretical findings establish that GNNs use nonlinear activation functions to create low-eigenvalue frequency content that can be processed in a stable manner by subsequent graph convolutional filters. However, the exact shape of the frequency content created by nonlinear functions is not known, and thus, it cannot be learned nor controlled. In this work, node-variant graph filters (NVGFs) are shown to be capable of creating frequency content and are thus used in lieu of nonlinear activation functions. This results in a novel GNN architecture that, although linear, is capable of creating frequency content as well. Furthermore, this new frequency content can be either designed or learned from data. In this way, the role of frequency creation is separated from the nonlinear nature of traditional GNNs. Extensive simulations are carried out to differentiate the contributions of frequency creation from those of the nonlinearity.",0
"In graph neural networks (GNN), message passing is a popular operation used to aggregate node features over neighboring nodes and edges. However, current GNN models apply uniform message functions across all neighbors, neglecting important structural differences between connected components that could lead to more expressive representations. This paper proposes a new mechanism called ""node variant filters"" that can capture localized patterns while preserving global connectivity through explicit computation of pathways from target nodes to their source communities. By leveraging variant graphs as an inductive bias and training filters on them, we show how the resulting node embeddings achieve significantly better clustering performance than state-of-the-art alternatives. Our approach enables efficient model sharing while adaptively learning per-instance task information at inference time, making our methodology appealing for large-scale machine learning tasks such as semi-supervised classification on real-world knowledge graphs where prior domain knowledge may vary widely. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture delivers strong improvements across diverse domains ranging from biological systems to social media platforms.",1
"Networks are ubiquitous in the real world. Link prediction, as one of the key problems for network-structured data, aims to predict whether there exists a link between two nodes. The traditional approaches are based on the explicit similarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding each node into a low-dimensional space. In order to efficiently handle the intensive similarity computation in link prediction, the hashing technique has been successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space. However, the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from the randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash techniques in the embedding process. Currently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework has been widely applied to the graph-related tasks in an end-to-end manner, but it commonly requires substantial computational resources and memory costs due to massive parameter learning, which makes the GNN-based algorithms impractical without the help of a powerful workhorse. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective model called #GNN, which balances the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. #GNN is able to efficiently acquire node representation in the Hamming space for link prediction by exploiting the randomized hashing technique to implement message passing and capture high-order proximity in the GNN framework. Furthermore, we characterize the discriminative power of #GNN in probability. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed #GNN algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to the learning-based algorithms and outperforms the randomized algorithm, while running significantly faster than the learning-based algorithms. Also, the proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability on a large-scale network with the limited resources.",0

To address this issue, we propose a new method that leverages hashing techniques to significantly reduce the computation time required by GNNs while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Our approach involves training GNN models using fast, hash-based neighborhood aggregation methods instead of traditional matrix multiplication. This enables us to scale up our model to handle larger graphs without sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction algorithms both in terms of runtime and accuracy. Our work shows the potential of combining the power of GNNs with efficient data structures like hashing, opening up exciting opportunities for applications in domains where scalability is critical.",1
"Estimating the amount of electricity that can be produced by rooftop photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches. Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a rooftop.",0
"This paper presents a methodology that allows local government to estimate solar energy potential from rooftop segments using digital imagery and building footprints. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on aerial images labeled by human annotators.

These results allow policymakers to assess their current renewable portfolio standards and target communities where they can achieve higher adoption rates through informed decision making. Ultimately, our model provides valuable insight into how municipalities can optimize their transition towards sustainable, clean energy sources.

"Functional connectivity (FC) between regions of the brain can be assessed by the degree of temporal correlation measured with functional neuroimaging modalities. Based on the fact that these connectivities build a network, graph-based approaches for analyzing the brain connectome have provided insights into the functions of the human brain. The development of graph neural networks (GNNs) capable of learning representation from graph structured data has led to increased interest in learning the graph representation of the brain connectome. Although recent attempts to apply GNN to the FC network have shown promising results, there is still a common limitation that they usually do not incorporate the dynamic characteristics of the FC network which fluctuates over time. In addition, a few studies that have attempted to use dynamic FC as an input for the GNN reported a reduction in performance compared to static FC methods, and did not provide temporal explainability. Here, we propose STAGIN, a method for learning dynamic graph representation of the brain connectome with spatio-temporal attention. Specifically, a temporal sequence of brain graphs is input to the STAGIN to obtain the dynamic graph representation, while novel READOUT functions and the Transformer encoder provide spatial and temporal explainability with attention, respectively. Experiments on the HCP-Rest and the HCP-Task datasets demonstrate exceptional performance of our proposed method. Analysis of the spatio-temporal attention also provide concurrent interpretation with the neuroscientific knowledge, which further validates our method. Code is available at https://github.com/egyptdj/stagin",0
"This paper presents a novel deep learning approach to represent brain connectivity patterns using dynamic graphs, which can capture both static (structural) as well as time-varying aspects (functional).

Our model takes advantage of the structural knowledge embedded in static graphs, while considering temporal variations by adaptively attending to different regions across distinct timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets: Human Connectome Project (HCP), and Neuroimaging Data Archive (NDAR) multi-center study dataset. Additionally, we show that our method improves decoding accuracy in predicting cognitive test scores, suggesting that these learned dynamic graph representations provide more informative features capturing relevant neuronal activity patterns than traditional static models alone. Overall, our work paves a new path towards understanding how brain dynamics emerge from complex interactions among spatially distributed networks of interacting elements over time.",1
"Kernel methods on discrete domains have shown great promise for many challenging data types, for instance, biological sequence data and molecular structure data. Scalable kernel methods like Support Vector Machines may offer good predictive performances but do not intrinsically provide uncertainty estimates. In contrast, probabilistic kernel methods like Gaussian Processes offer uncertainty estimates in addition to good predictive performance but fall short in terms of scalability. While the scalability of Gaussian processes can be improved using sparse inducing point approximations, the selection of these inducing points remains challenging. We explore different techniques for selecting inducing points on discrete domains, including greedy selection, determinantal point processes, and simulated annealing. We find that simulated annealing, which can select inducing points that are not in the training set, can perform competitively with support vector machines and full Gaussian processes on synthetic data, as well as on challenging real-world DNA sequence data.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in applying machine learning techniques to problems where data may be collected over a discrete domain rather than a continuous one. However, many existing approaches rely heavily on assumptions such as stationarity and smoothness that may not hold in these settings, leading to poor performance.  In this work, we propose a scalable method for fitting Gaussian processes (GPs) to data sampled from discrete domains, allowing us to capture complex relationships while remaining flexible enough to accommodate nonstationary and discontinuous functions. Our approach relies on adaptive quadrature rules tailored specifically to GP models defined over finite input spaces, which significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional schemes based on numerical integration or sampling strategies.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a variety of benchmark datasets drawn from diverse application areas including regression, classification, and time series modeling. Results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different evaluation metrics, making it well suited for tackling large-scale inference tasks and realistic scenarios involving sparsely distributed data. Additionally, we provide extensive experimental evidence emphasizing the impact of key hyperparameters on prediction accuracy and runtime efficiency under varying problem configurations.  Overall, the results highlight the potential benefits of adopting scalable methods for GP inference over discrete domains to address pressing challenges posed by big data applications in fields ranging from sensor networks and signal processing to bioinformatics and neuroscience. We hope that this research inspires further advancements toward developing robust probabilistic frameworks capable of handling increasingly intricate scientific questions motivated by real-world observations.",1

By regarding an observation as a superposition of features, we introduce the concept of wave-particle duality in machine learning and propose a generalized framework that unifies the classical and the quantum probability. We show that STC possesses a wide range of desirable properties not available in most other machine learning methods but it is at the same time exceptionally easy to comprehend and use. Empirical evaluation of STC on structured data and text classification demonstrates that our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both standard classifiers and deep learning, at the additional benefit of requiring minimal data pre-processing and hyper-parameter tuning. Moreover, STC provides a native explanation of its predictions both for single instances and for each target label globally.",0

By incorporating a measure of epistemic uncertainty into our decision making process, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different factors contribute to the final prediction. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, our work shows promising potential for applying quantum computing techniques to machine learning problems where interpretability and accuracy are important considerations.",1
"Over the last few years, we have seen increasing data generated from non-Euclidean domains, which are usually represented as graphs with complex relationships, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained a high interest because of their potential in processing graph-structured data. In particular, there is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Convolution on graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the graph structure of data, recently, there is an increasing interest in investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt the behaviour of a GCNN to the input proposing two ways to perform spatial convolution on graphs using input-based filters which are dynamically generated. Our model also investigates the problem of discovering and refining relations among nodes. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of the proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using simple architectures with a low number of filters.",0
"Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to model graph structured data effectively. However, traditional GCNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node representations lose important details as features propagate through multiple layers. This can lead to poor performance on downstream tasks that require discriminative information at fine scales. To address these issues, we propose dynamic filters, which adaptively learn high frequency channels for each layer based on local spectral analysis of the feature maps. Our approach allows the network to capture both global graph structure and local, high frequency patterns, enabling more expressive representation learning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets including MoleculeNet and Reddit Commentary Corpus using our proposed method. Overall, our work provides insights into how to design effective architectures for graph structured problems.",1
"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in dealing with data of non-Euclidean structures. Their success directly attributes to fitting graph structures effectively to data such as in social media and knowledge databases. For image processing applications, the use of graph structures and GCNs have not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder network with added graph convolutions by converting feature maps to vertexes of a pre-generated graph to synthetically construct graph-structured data. By doing this, we inexplicitly apply graph Laplacian regularization to the feature maps, making them more structured. The experiments show that it significantly boosts performance for image restoration tasks, including deblurring and super-resolution. We believe it opens up opportunities for GCN-based approaches in more applications.",0
"In recent years graph convolutional networks (GCN) have emerged as powerful tools for image restoration tasks such as deblurring and super-resolution, thanks to their ability to learn local geometric relationships among pixels in feature space. However, despite their success there remains room for improvement: current GCN models operate directly on images, leading to slow inference times and requiring large amounts of memory; furthermore, these methods may suffer from checkerboard artifacts caused by oversmoothing. To address these issues, we propose using GCNs in feature space instead. We introduce FusionGAN++, a new model that operates solely in feature space, allowing for faster inference and reduced memory usage. Our approach uses multiple generators and discriminators operating at different scales, which allows us to create high-quality outputs without suffering from checkerboard artifacts. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN, demonstrating its effectiveness across a range of applications. Overall, we believe that this work represents an important step forward in advancing deep learning techniques for image restoration tasks.",1
"Traditional approaches for data anonymization consider relational data and textual data independently. We propose rx-anon, an anonymization approach for heterogeneous semi-structured documents composed of relational and textual attributes. We map sensitive terms extracted from the text to the structured data. This allows us to use concepts like k-anonymity to generate a joined, privacy-preserved version of the heterogeneous data input. We introduce the concept of redundant sensitive information to consistently anonymize the heterogeneous data. To control the influence of anonymization over unstructured textual data versus structured data attributes, we introduce a modified, parameterized Mondrian algorithm. The parameter $\lambda$ allows to give different weight on the relational and textual attributes during the anonymization process. We evaluate our approach with two real-world datasets using a Normalized Certainty Penalty score, adapted to the problem of jointly anonymizing relational and textual data. The results show that our approach is capable of reducing information loss by using the tuning parameter to control the Mondrian partitioning while guaranteeing k-anonymity for relational attributes as well as for sensitive terms. As rx-anon is a framework approach, it can be reused and extended by other anonymization algorithms, privacy models, and textual similarity metrics.",0
"This paper proposes a new approach to de-identify heterogenous data using a modified Mondrian algorithm. The proposed method overcomes some limitations of previous approaches by introducing additional measures of data privacy.

In addition, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed method through simulations using real world data sets, demonstrating that it effectively balances privacy concerns with utility. Overall, the findings suggest that the RX-Anon model could provide a valuable tool for researchers seeking to share healthcare data without compromising individual patient privacy.",1

"We study the multiple manifold problem, a binary classification task modeled on applications in machine vision, in which a deep fully-connected neural network is trained to separate two low-dimensional submanifolds of the unit sphere. We provide an analysis of the one-dimensional case, proving for a simple manifold configuration that when the network depth $L$ is large relative to certain geometric and statistical properties of the data, the network width $n$ grows as a sufficiently large polynomial in $L$, and the number of i.i.d. samples from the manifolds is polynomial in $L$, randomly-initialized gradient descent rapidly learns to classify the two manifolds perfectly with high probability. Our analysis demonstrates concrete benefits of depth and width in the context of a practically-motivated model problem: the depth acts as a fitting resource, with larger depths corresponding to smoother networks that can more readily separate the class manifolds, and the width acts as a statistical resource, enabling concentration of the randomly-initialized network and its gradients. The argument centers around the neural tangent kernel and its role in the nonasymptotic analysis of training overparameterized neural networks; to this literature, we contribute essentially optimal rates of concentration for the neural tangent kernel of deep fully-connected networks, requiring width $n \gtrsim L\,\mathrm{poly}(d_0)$ to achieve uniform concentration of the initial kernel over a $d_0$-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n_0-1}$, and a nonasymptotic framework for establishing generalization of networks trained in the NTK regime with structured data. The proof makes heavy use of martingale concentration to optimally treat statistical dependencies across layers of the initial random network. This approach should be of use in establishing similar results for other network architectures.",0

"In this paper, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework called VoxelContext-Net for both static and dynamic point cloud compression. Taking advantages of both octree based methods and voxel based schemes, our approach employs the voxel context to compress the octree structured data. Specifically, we first extract the local voxel representation that encodes the spatial neighbouring context information for each node in the constructed octree. Then, in the entropy coding stage, we propose a voxel context based deep entropy model to compress the symbols of non-leaf nodes in a lossless way. Furthermore, for dynamic point cloud compression, we additionally introduce the local voxel representations from the temporal neighbouring point clouds to exploit temporal dependency. More importantly, to alleviate the distortion from the octree construction procedure, we propose a voxel context based 3D coordinate refinement method to produce more accurate reconstructed point cloud at the decoder side, which is applicable to both static and dynamic point cloud compression. The comprehensive experiments on both static and dynamic point cloud benchmark datasets(e.g., ScanNet and Semantic KITTI) clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed method VoxelContext-Net for 3D point cloud geometry compression.",0
"In recent years, point cloud data has become increasingly prevalent due to advancements in remote sensing technology such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. However, processing and transmission of large amounts of unstructured point cloud data can pose significant challenges in terms of memory usage, computational efficiency, and storage costs. To address these issues, we propose VoxelContext-Net: an octree-based framework for efficient point cloud compression that leverages deep learning techniques.  Our approach uses 2D/3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) embedded within a hierarchical octree structure to compress the dense point clouds while retaining their inherent geometric and semantic features. We introduce two novel variants of voxels, namely, VoxelContext and DenseVoxelContext, which further enhance the performance of our model by enabling a more effective spatial context aggregation mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that VoxelContext-Net achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets across various metrics, including accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and feature preservation measures like Chamfer distance and Hausdorff distance. Additionally, our method outperforms existing approaches by up to 6% in MSE and PSNR while reducing the file size by at least 50%.  Furthermore, VoxelContext-Net can flexibly handle large-scale real-world point cloud data from diverse domains without retraining through its robust octree hierarchy design. By balancing both lossy and lossless compression ratios, our solution enables fine-grained tradeoffs between compression rate and reconstruction quality, making it suitable for numerous applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, computer vision, virtual reality, augmented reality, and gaming industries where massive point clouds must be processed efficiently.  In summary, VoxelContext-Net is a powerful tool for effectively handling large-scale unstructured point cloud data in a variety of domai",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance in learning graph-structured data and various tasks. However, many current GNNs suffer from three common problems when facing large-size graphs or using a deeper structure: neighbors explosion, node dependence, and oversmoothing. Such problems attribute to the data structures of the graph itself or the designing of the multi-layers GNNs framework, and can lead to low training efficiency and high space complexity. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a general subgraph-based training framework, namely Ripple Walk Training (RWT), for deep and large graph neural networks. RWT samples subgraphs from the full graph to constitute a mini-batch, and the full GNN is updated based on the mini-batch gradient. We analyze the high-quality subgraphs to train GNNs in a theoretical way. A novel sampling method Ripple Walk Sampler works for sampling these high-quality subgraphs to constitute the mini-batch, which considers both the randomness and connectivity of the graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on different sizes of graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RWT in training various GNNs (GCN & GAT).",0
"Here's a draft abstract for your paper ""Ripple Walk Training: A Subgraph-based training framework for Large and Deep Graph Neural Network"":  Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large datasets can pose significant challenges due to their memory requirements and computational complexity. In recent years, several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, including mini-batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and subgraph sampling methods likeGraph Convolutional Network Sampling (GCNS). However, these methods suffer from limitations such as high variance, slow convergence rate, and suboptimal accuracy compared to full batch optimization.  To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel training framework called Ripple Walk Training (RTW), which is based on a subgraph-based method that effectively samples nodes and edges from the original graph during each iteration of the model updates. Specifically, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-like approach where each node moves one step at a time to neighboring nodes that satisfy certain criteria. By doing so, RTW enables efficient and parallelizable computation of GNN models while preserving the global structure of the graph.  We evaluate our proposed method on a range of tasks using four commonly used benchmark datasets for both undirected and directed graphs, demonstrating that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than state-of-the-art baseline models across all metrics. Our results showcase the effectiveness of RWT in scaling up GNNs for large, deep architectures while maintaining superior test set accuracy.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the standard method for numerous tasks on graph-structured data such as node classification. However, real-world graphs are often evolving over time and even new classes may arise. We model these challenges as an instance of lifelong learning, in which a learner faces a sequence of tasks and may take over knowledge acquired in past tasks. Such knowledge may be stored explicitly as historic data or implicitly within model parameters. In this work, we systematically analyze the influence of implicit and explicit knowledge. Therefore, we present an incremental training method for lifelong learning on graphs and introduce a new measure based on $k$-neighborhood time differences to address variances in the historic data. We apply our training method to five representative GNN architectures and evaluate them on three new lifelong node classification datasets. Our results show that no more than 50% of the GNN's receptive field is necessary to retain at least 95% accuracy compared to training over the complete history of the graph data. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that implicit knowledge becomes more important when fewer explicit knowledge is available.",0

"\textit{Graph Neural Network} (GNN) is a promising approach for analyzing graph-structured data that tactfully captures their dependency information via node-level message passing. It has achieved state-of-the-art performances in many tasks, such as node classification, graph matching, clustering, and graph generation. As GNNs operate on non-Euclidean data, their irregular data access patterns cause considerable computational costs and overhead on conventional architectures, such as GPU and CPU. Our analysis shows that GNN adopts a hybrid computing model. The \textit{Aggregation} (or \textit{Message Passing}) phase performs vector additions where vectors are fetched with irregular strides. The \textit{Transformation} (or \textit{Node Embedding}) phase can be either dense or sparse-dense matrix multiplication. In this work, We propose \textit{VersaGNN}, an ultra-efficient, systolic-array-based versatile hardware accelerator that unifies dense and sparse matrix multiplication.

"Network-structured data becomes ubiquitous in daily life and is growing at a rapid pace. It presents great challenges to feature engineering due to the high non-linearity and sparsity of the data. The local and global structure of the real-world networks can be reflected by dynamical transfer behaviors among nodes.

We first design a degree-weight biased random walk model to capture the transfer behaviors on the network. Then a deep network embedding method is introduced to preserve the transfer possibilities among the nodes. A network structure embedding layer is added into conventional deep prediction models, including Long Short-Term Memory Network and Recurrent Neural Network, to utilize the sequence prediction ability. To keep the local network neighborhood, we further perform a Laplacian supervised space optimization on the embedding feature representations.

"Efficient video processing is a critical component in many IoMT applications to detect events of interest. Presently, many window optimization techniques have been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the incoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to the lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources such as CCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same time, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally intensive Deep Neural Network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at high-end (or cloud) nodes.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging deep learning model class, can extract meaningful representations from highly expressive graph-structured data and are therefore gaining popularity for wider ranges of applications. However, current GNNs suffer from the poor performance of their sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) operator, even when using powerful GPUs. Our analysis shows that 95% of the inference time could be spent on SpMM when running popular GNN models on NVIDIA's advanced V100 GPU. Such SpMM performance bottleneck hinders GNNs' applicability to large-scale problems or the development of more sophisticated GNN models. To address this inference time bottleneck, we introduce ES-SpMM, a cache-first edge sampling mechanism and codesigned SpMM kernel. ES-SpMM uses edge sampling to downsize the graph to fit into GPU's shared memory. It thus reduces the computation cost and improves SpMM's cache locality. To evaluate ES-SpMM's performance, we integrated it with a popular GNN framework, DGL, and tested it using representative GNN models and datasets. Our results show that ES-SpMM outperforms the highly optimized cuSPARSE SpMM kernel by up to 4.35x with no accuracy loss and by 45.3x with less than a 1% accuracy loss.",0

"Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular paradigm for global optimization of expensive black-box functions, but there are many domains where the function is not completely black-box. The data may have some known structure, e.g. symmetries, and the data generation process can yield useful intermediate or auxiliary information in addition to the value of the optimization objective. However, surrogate models traditionally employed in BO, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), scale poorly with dataset size and struggle to incorporate known structure or auxiliary information. Instead, we propose performing BO on complex, structured problems by using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), a class of scalable surrogate models that have the representation power and flexibility to handle structured data and exploit auxiliary information. We demonstrate BO on a number of realistic problems in physics and chemistry, including topology optimization of photonic crystal materials using convolutional neural networks, and chemical property optimization of molecules using graph neural networks. On these complex tasks, we show that BNNs often outperform GPs as surrogate models for BO in terms of both sampling efficiency and computational cost.",0

"Recently, there has been great success in applying deep neural networks on graph structured data. Most work, however, focuses on either node- or graph-level supervised learning, such as node, link or graph classification or node-level unsupervised learning (e.g. node clustering). Despite its wide range of possible applications, graph-level unsupervised learning has not received much attention yet. This might be mainly attributed to the high representation complexity of graphs, which can be represented by n! equivalent adjacency matrices, where n is the number of nodes. In this work we address this issue by proposing a permutation-invariant variational autoencoder for graph structured data. Our proposed model indirectly learns to match the node ordering of input and output graph, without imposing a particular node ordering or performing expensive graph matching.

In this paper we propose HAP, a hierarchical graph-level representation learning framework, which is adaptively sensitive to graph structures, i.e., HAP clusters local substructures incorporating with high-order dependencies. HAP utilizes a novel cross-level attention mechanism MOA to naturally focus more on close neighborhood while effectively capture higher-order dependency that may contain crucial information. It also learns a global graph content GCont that extracts the graph pattern properties to make the pre- and post-coarsening graph content maintain stable, thus providing global guidance in graph coarsening. This novel innovation also facilitates generalization across graphs with the same form of features.

One common challenge faced in these areas is the difficulty of capturing high-order dependencies within graphs, which can lead to limited performance in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose a new method called Hierarchical Adaptive Pooling by Capturing High-order Dependency (HAPCHD). Our approach leverages a hierarchical architecture that adaptively pools node features at different levels of granularity while preserving high-order dependency structures. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets that HAPCHD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of evaluation metrics. Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework. Overall, our work represents an important contribution to the field of graph representation learning and highlights the potential of HAPCHD as a powerful tool for addressing complex dependency structure challenges.",1
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted in the representation learning of graph-structured data and provided state-of-the-art performance in various applications such as link prediction, node classification, and recommendation. Motivated by recent advances of self-supervision for representation learning in natural language processing and computer vision, self-supervised learning has been recently studied to leverage unlabeled graph-structured data. However, employing self-supervision tasks as auxiliary tasks to assist a primary task has been less explored in the literature on graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised auxiliary learning framework to effectively learn graph neural networks. Moreover, this work is the first study showing that a meta-path prediction is beneficial as a self-supervised auxiliary task for heterogeneous graphs. Our method is learning to learn a primary task with various auxiliary tasks to improve generalization performance. The proposed method identifies an effective combination of auxiliary tasks and automatically balances them to improve the primary task. Our methods can be applied to any graph neural network in a plug-in manner without manual labeling or additional data. Also, it can be extended to any other auxiliary tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the performance of node classification and link prediction.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning on graphs. However, they often require large amounts of labeled data, which can be difficult or expensive to obtain. To address this problem, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary learning approach that uses meta-learning to train GNNs using unlabeled data. Our method involves training two subnetworks simultaneously: a main network that learns the desired task using supervision, and an auxiliary network that learns a contrastive objective using unlabeled data. We show through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches that use only supervised or semi-supervised learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world social and biological applications where label scarcity is a major challenge. Overall, our work represents an important step towards making GNNs more scalable and accessible for real-world tasks.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved to be an effective representation learning framework for graph-structured data, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many practical predictive tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. Among the variants of GNNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) learn to assign dense attention coefficients over all neighbors of a node for feature aggregation, and improve the performance of many graph learning tasks. However, real-world graphs are often very large and noisy, and GATs are prone to overfitting if not regularized properly. Even worse, the local aggregation mechanism of GATs may fail on disassortative graphs, where nodes within local neighborhood provide more noise than useful information for feature aggregation. In this paper, we propose Sparse Graph Attention Networks (SGATs) that learn sparse attention coefficients under an $L_0$-norm regularization, and the learned sparse attentions are then used for all GNN layers, resulting in an edge-sparsified graph. By doing so, we can identify noisy/task-irrelevant edges, and thus perform feature aggregation on most informative neighbors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SGATs. In particular, SGATs can remove about 50\%-80\% edges from large assortative graphs, while retaining similar classification accuracies. On disassortative graphs, SGATs prune majority of noisy edges and outperform GATs in classification accuracies by significant margins. Furthermore, the removed edges can be interpreted intuitively and quantitatively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first graph learning algorithm that shows significant redundancies in graphs and edge-sparsified graphs can achieve similar or sometimes higher predictive performances than original graphs.",0
"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by enabling powerful models that can learn from large amounts of data without explicit programming. Recent research has shown promising results using convolutional neural networks (CNN) pretrained on ImageNet for fine-grained tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, these models have two main limitations: they suffer from the ""black box"" problem because their internal workings are difficult to interpret, and they require vast computational resources during both training and deployment. In this paper, we present sparse graph attention networks (SGN), a novel deep learning architecture designed to address these issues while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach uses classical techniques from graph theory and linear algebra to build interpretable connections among features extracted at different stages of processing. We employ a spatial transformer network (STN) to generate affinity maps based on feature similarity, which serve as soft weights for bilinear pooling. This ensures local connectivity and allows our model to capture global context in a computationally efficient manner. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show that SGNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on several challenging vision problems while requiring fewer parameters and less memory than competing methods. Overall, our proposed architecture represents a significant step towards transparent and scalable artificial intelligence, opening up new opportunities for scientific inquiry into how biological systems process sensory input.",1
"Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks.

"Deep learning has recently demonstrated its promising performance for vision-based parking-slot detection. However, very few existing methods explicitly take into account learning the link information of the marking-points, resulting in complex post-processing and erroneous detection. In this paper, we propose an attentional graph neural network based parking-slot detection method, which refers the marking-points in an around-view image as graph-structured data and utilize graph neural network to aggregate the neighboring information between marking-points. Without any manually designed post-processing, the proposed method is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments have been conducted on public benchmark dataset, where the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Jiaolong/gcn-parking-slot}.",0
"This research paper presents a novel approach to parking slot detection using attentional graph neural networks (AGNN). Parking slot detection is a crucial task for autonomous driving systems as it helps vehicles locate suitable parking spots quickly and accurately.

AGNN addresses these issues by leveraging attention mechanisms within graph neural networks, allowing the model to learn effective representations directly from raw sensor data without handcrafted features. Our experimental results demonstrate that AGNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art parking spot detectors while requiring fewer computations. Moreover, we show that our method generalizes well across diverse weather conditions, lighting environments, and parking settings, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios. Overall, this study offers important contributions towards enabling safer and more efficient transportation systems through advanced computer vision technologies.",1
"Generalizable, transferrable, and robust representation learning on graph-structured data remains a challenge for current graph neural networks (GNNs). Unlike what has been developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data, self-supervised learning and pre-training are less explored for GNNs. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) framework for learning unsupervised representations of graph data. We first design four types of graph augmentations to incorporate various priors. We then systematically study the impact of various combinations of graph augmentations on multiple datasets, in four different settings: semi-supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning as well as adversarial attacks. The results show that, even without tuning augmentation extents nor using sophisticated GNN architectures, our GraphCL framework can produce graph representations of similar or better generalizability, transferrability, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate the impact of parameterized graph augmentation extents and patterns, and observe further performance gains in preliminary experiments. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL.",0
"Recent advances in graph contrastive learning have achieved impressive performance on node classification tasks across diverse domains such as biology, chemistry, and computer science. However, most existing methods assume that input graphs are deterministic and noise-free, which may limit their effectiveness on real-world datasets where data can exhibit high variability due to measurement errors, missing values, or other sources of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a novel augmentation framework that generates multiple stochastic variants of each input graph by applying random transformations based on statistical properties of the underlying dataset. We show that these augmented versions significantly boost the performance of state-of-the-art GCL algorithms while reducing overfitting risks due to memorization effects associated with batch normalization layers. Our experiments demonstrate the competitive empirical results of our approach across several benchmarks from different fields, confirming its generalizability and suitability for large-scale applications in various scientific disciplines. Overall, this research provides insights into how advanced machine learning techniques could benefit from incorporating more systematic strategies designed to account for the presence of noisy inputs, potentially leading to new breakthroughs in knowledge discovery using heterogeneous big data collections beyond traditional image recognition scenarios.",1
"Generative modeling of set-structured data, such as point clouds, requires reasoning over local and global structures at various scales. However, adopting multi-scale frameworks for ordinary sequential data to a set-structured data is nontrivial as it should be invariant to the permutation of its elements. In this paper, we propose SetVAE, a hierarchical variational autoencoder for sets. Motivated by recent progress in set encoding, we build SetVAE upon attentive modules that first partition the set and project the partition back to the original cardinality. Exploiting this module, our hierarchical VAE learns latent variables at multiple scales, capturing coarse-to-fine dependency of the set elements while achieving permutation invariance. We evaluate our model on point cloud generation task and achieve competitive performance to the prior arts with substantially smaller model capacity. We qualitatively demonstrate that our model generalizes to unseen set sizes and learns interesting subset relations without supervision. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/jw9730/setvae.",0
"This paper presents a novel architecture called Set Variational Autoencoder (SetVAE) which can learn hierarchical composition of sets for generative modeling of set structured data. Set-structured data has recently gained significant attention due to its prevalence in numerous real world applications such as image collections, social media datasets, and biological systems. Existing models used for generating synthetic examples from these type of data suffer from limitations including their lack of capacity to generate high quality results and limited ability to preserve crucial attributes during generation processes. We propose SetVAE as a solution that addresses these issues by modeling sets using latent variables that capture hierarchical relationships between objects within sets and allowing more efficient inference through variational methods. Our experiments on several benchmark dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the art algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively. Overall, we believe our work significantly advances research in generative modeling of complex set-structured data.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) draw their strength from explicitly modeling the topological information of structured data. However, existing GNNs suffer from limited capability in capturing the hierarchical graph representation which plays an important role in graph classification. In this paper, we innovatively propose hierarchical graph capsule network (HGCN) that can jointly learn node embeddings and extract graph hierarchies. Specifically, disentangled graph capsules are established by identifying heterogeneous factors underlying each node, such that their instantiation parameters represent different properties of the same entity. To learn the hierarchical representation, HGCN characterizes the part-whole relationship between lower-level capsules (part) and higher-level capsules (whole) by explicitly considering the structure information among the parts. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HGCN and the contribution of each component.",0
"Here is an example:  ---  Hierarchical graph capsules (HGCs) are a new type of capsule that can learn and represent hierarchies of interrelated concepts in images. HGCs capture both spatial and relational information and can encode structured knowledge into the network parameters. They have been shown to be effective at solving tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. In this paper we present results on using HGCs to learn representations from raw pixel data directly, without the need for convolutional preprocessing layers. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets. Our implementation is open source and we provide detailed explanations and examples so others can use and build upon our work.  ---",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted increasing attention due to its successful applications on various graph-structure data. However, recent studies have shown that adversarial attacks are threatening the functionality of GNNs. Although numerous works have been proposed to defend adversarial attacks from various perspectives, most of them can be robust against the attacks only on specific scenarios. To address this shortage of robust generalization, we propose to defend the adversarial attacks on GNN through applying the Spatio-Temporal sparsification (called ST-Sparse) on the GNN hidden node representation. ST-Sparse is similar to the Dropout regularization in spirit. Through intensive experiment evaluation with GCN as the target GNN model, we identify the benefits of ST-Sparse as follows: (1) ST-Sparse shows the defense performance improvement in most cases, as it can effectively increase the robust accuracy by up to 6\% improvement; (2) ST-Sparse illustrates its robust generalization capability by integrating with the existing defense methods, similar to the integration of Dropout into various deep learning models as a standard regularization technique; (3) ST-Sparse also shows its ordinary generalization capability on clean datasets, in that ST-SparseGCN (the integration of ST-Sparse and the original GCN) even outperform the original GCN, while the other three representative defense methods are inferior to the original GCN.",0
"This paper introduces spatiotemporal sparsification for general robust graph convolution networks (GRGCN), which allows efficient training of deep GRGCN models on large datasets while maintaining high accuracy. We first investigate the properties of spatial sparsification and temporal sparsification individually, then combine them into a single algorithm that can effectively prune both spatial edges and temporal dimensions simultaneously. Our approach uses an adaptive edge importance ranking mechanism to filter out unimportant edges at runtime, resulting in significant performance improvements over baseline methods without compromising model accuracy. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 4x speedups on GPU and CPU platforms with negligible loss in prediction accuracy.",1
"Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of mortality. Accurately monitoring HF progress and adjust therapies are critical for improving patient outcomes. An experienced cardiologist can make accurate HF stage diagnoses based on combination of symptoms, signs, and lab results from the electronic health records (EHR) of a patient, without directly measuring heart function. We examined whether machine learning models, more specifically the XGBoost model, can accurately predict patient stage based on EHR, and we further applied the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework to identify informative features and their interpretations. Our results indicate that based on structured data from EHR, our models could predict patients' ejection fraction (EF) scores with moderate accuracy. SHAP analyses identified informative features and revealed potential clinical subtypes of HF. Our findings provide insights on how to design computing systems to accurately monitor disease progression of HF patients through continuously mining patients' EHR data.",0
"In recent years, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become increasingly important tools in medical research. By analyzing large amounts of patient data stored in these records, researchers can identify patterns that could lead to more effective treatments and better outcomes for patients. One challenge faced by researchers working with EHRs is understanding how different features contribute to clinical predictions made by machine learning models. This study aims to address this issue by using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), which provides feature attributions to explain black box model predictions.  The specific focus of this study is heart failure, a chronic condition affecting millions of individuals worldwide. To investigate the relationship between clinical features and prediction accuracy, we trained a tree-based model on a dataset containing EHR data from heart failure patients. We then used SHAP to interpret the model's predictions and determine which clinical features had the greatest impact on predictive performance. Our results show that certain clinical features such as age, sex, race, and co-morbidities were consistently significant across all tree nodes and contributed to improved prediction accuracy. However, there were some unexpected findings, including a negative association between serum creatinine levels and hospital readmission prediction. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of interpreting machine learning models and underscores the need for further investigation into potential causes behind counterintuitive results. Ultimately, our analysis may inform future interventions aimed at improving outcomes for heart failure patients.",1
"The emergence of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has greatly boosted the progress of graph learning. However, two disturbing factors, noise and redundancy in graph data, and lack of interpretation for prediction results, impede further development of GCN. One solution is to recognize a predictive yet compressed subgraph to get rid of the noise and redundancy and obtain the interpretable part of the graph. This setting of subgraph is similar to the information bottleneck (IB) principle, which is less studied on graph-structured data and GCN. Inspired by the IB principle, we propose a novel subgraph information bottleneck (SIB) framework to recognize such subgraphs, named IB-subgraph. However, the intractability of mutual information and the discrete nature of graph data makes the objective of SIB notoriously hard to optimize. To this end, we introduce a bilevel optimization scheme coupled with a mutual information estimator for irregular graphs. Moreover, we propose a continuous relaxation for subgraph selection with a connectivity loss for stabilization. We further theoretically prove the error bound of our estimation scheme for mutual information and the noise-invariant nature of IB-subgraph. Extensive experiments on graph learning and large-scale point cloud tasks demonstrate the superior property of IB-subgraph.",0
"This is an example of a well thought out informative and scientific sounding title: ""A Machine Learning Approach To Recognition And Classification Of Complex Data Sets Using Graph Based Feature Extraction"" The Abstract should be written in language that can be easily understood by someone who has some knowledge of the field but may not have read all the background material associated with your paper.

Recent advances in machine learning approaches have revolutionized the ability to recognize complex patterns in large datasets, allowing for more accurate predictions than ever before. One particularly effective technique involves using graph-based feature extraction (GBFE) to identify substructures within predictive models which exhibit bottlenecks in their flow of information. These information bottlenecks act as crucial points for classification accuracy, enabling more precise prediction of future events through recognition of past trends. By leveraging GBFE methods alongside classical statistical modeling techniques, we demonstrate improved performance in recognizing important substructure elements compared to traditional modeling frameworks alone. This study provides insights into how advanced machine learning algorithms can enhance our understanding of complex system behaviors across many domains, including biological networks, social media analysis, and cybersecurity threat detection.",1
"Random forests on the one hand, and neural networks on the other hand, have met great success in the machine learning community for their predictive performance. Combinations of both have been proposed in the literature, notably leading to the so-called deep forests (DF) (Zhou \& Feng,2019). In this paper, our aim is not to benchmark DF performances but to investigate instead their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, DF architecture can be generally simplified into more simple and computationally efficient shallow forest networks. Despite some instability, the latter may outperform standard predictive tree-based methods. We exhibit a theoretical framework in which a shallow tree network is shown to enhance the performance of classical decision trees. In such a setting, we provide tight theoretical lower and upper bounds on its excess risk. These theoretical results show the interest of tree-network architectures for well-structured data provided that the first layer, acting as a data encoder, is rich enough.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in understanding deep neural networks (DNNs) due to their impressive performance on complex tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and language translation. However, the lack of interpretability of DNNs remains one of the major obstacles to their widespread adoption. In particular, the internal representations learned by the hidden layers of these models have proven difficult to comprehend, which makes it challenging to evaluate their robustness and reliability. This study focuses on analyzing the tree-layer structure present in deep forest models, a variant of randomized decision trees that operates through averaging over multiple independent predictions from weak learner ensembles. We explore the relationship between the tree depth and different metrics commonly used to evaluate classifiers, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC ROC curve, and confusion matrix. Our results indicate that deeper trees can lead to better performance across all evaluation measures, although there exists an optimal depth beyond which further growth leads to diminishing returns. Additionally, we analyze the stability of the tree structures under perturbations in input features and show how the use of randomization during training improves the resilience of the model against noise. Overall, our work provides insight into the behavior of deep forest models and contributes towards enhancing the transparency of modern machine learning algorithms.

"Graph-structured data are ubiquitous. However, graphs encode diverse types of information and thus play different roles in data representation. In this paper, we distinguish the \textit{representational} and the \textit{correlational} roles played by the graphs in node-level prediction tasks, and we investigate how Graph Neural Network (GNN) models can effectively leverage both types of information. Conceptually, the representational information provides guidance for the model to construct better node features; while the correlational information indicates the correlation between node outcomes conditional on node features. Through a simulation study, we find that many popular GNN models are incapable of effectively utilizing the correlational information. By leveraging the idea of the copula, a principled way to describe the dependence among multivariate random variables, we offer a general solution. The proposed Copula Graph Neural Network (CopulaGNN) can take a wide range of GNN models as base models and utilize both representational and correlational information stored in the graphs. Experimental results on two types of regression tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data structures such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and biological networks.

To address this issue, we propose a new framework called ""CopulaGNN"" that integrates both representational and correlational roles of graphs into the learning process. Our approach leverages copula functions to capture the underlying dependency relationships among nodes while preserving their individual features using conventional GNN layers. This enables our model to better learn and reason about interdependent relationships within dense graphs, resulting in improved performance on downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets across different domains and show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, CopulaGNN offers a promising direction towards developing more effective GNN architectures for real-world applications.",1
"Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have received much attention recently, owing to their capability in handling graph-structured data. Among the existing GCNNs, many methods can be viewed as instances of a neural message passing motif; features of nodes are passed around their neighbors, aggregated and transformed to produce better nodes' representations. Nevertheless, these methods seldom use node transition probabilities, a measure that has been found useful in exploring graphs. Furthermore, when the transition probabilities are used, their transition direction is often improperly considered in the feature aggregation step, resulting in an inefficient weighting scheme. In addition, although a great number of GCNN models with increasing level of complexity have been introduced, the GCNNs often suffer from over-fitting when being trained on small graphs. Another issue of the GCNNs is over-smoothing, which tends to make nodes' representations indistinguishable. This work presents a new method to improve the message passing process based on node transition probabilities by properly considering the transition direction, leading to a better weighting scheme in nodes' features aggregation compared to the existing counterpart. Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method termed DropNode to address the over-fitting and over-smoothing issues simultaneously. DropNode randomly discards part of a graph, thus it creates multiple deformed versions of the graph, leading to data augmentation regularization effect. Additionally, DropNode lessens the connectivity of the graph, mitigating the effect of over-smoothing in deep GCNNs. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets for node and graph classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison with the state of the art.",0
"In recent years, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing graph data such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, computer vision, etc. However, existing approaches face challenges due to oversmoothing issues caused by propagating messages across all neighbor nodes indiscriminately and failure to capture localized features from each node’s neighborhood. To address these issues, we propose a novel message passing algorithm that considers the transition probability of edges in graphs. This approach significantly reduces the impact of distant neighbors on node representations while retaining the importance of immediate neighbors. Furthermore, dropout regularization techniques can mitigate overfitting issues during training. Our extensive experimental results show promising performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets. By incorporating transition probabilities into message passing and introducing dropout regularization, our method enhances GCNN performance in capturing localized features and reducing oversmoothing effects, making it suitable for numerous real-world applications involving complex graphs.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance on a wide variety of tasks due to their ability to model non-uniform structured data. Despite their promise, there exists little research exploring methods to make them more efficient at inference time. In this work, we explore the viability of training quantized GNNs, enabling the usage of low precision integer arithmetic during inference. We identify the sources of error that uniquely arise when attempting to quantize GNNs, and propose an architecturally-agnostic method, Degree-Quant, to improve performance over existing quantization-aware training baselines commonly used on other architectures, such as CNNs. We validate our method on six datasets and show, unlike previous attempts, that models generalize to unseen graphs. Models trained with Degree-Quant for INT8 quantization perform as well as FP32 models in most cases; for INT4 models, we obtain up to 26% gains over the baselines. Our work enables up to 4.7x speedups on CPU when using INT8 arithmetic.",0
"Here is a possible abstract for the ""Degree-Quant"" paper on quantization-aware training for graph neural networks:  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive results on numerous tasks, but their computational demands often make them challenging to deploy in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. One approach to addressing this issue is through the use of quantization techniques that reduce the precision of floating-point numbers used by GNN models, allowing for faster inference times without sacrificing accuracy. However, traditional approaches to quantizing GNNs can lead to significant losses in performance due to the complex nature of these models.  In this work, we propose a novel method called ""degree-quant"" for improving quantization-aware training of GNNs. Our approach uses degree normalization to control the magnitude of weights in the model, which allows us to tune the bitwidth during training to maximize efficiency while maintaining high levels of accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using several benchmark datasets and show that our proposed technique outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for quantizing GNNs. By incorporating degree-quant into training pipelines, developers can create more efficient and powerful GNN models that can operate effectively even on limited hardware resources. Overall, our research offers valuable insights into improving the tradeoff between computation efficiency and quality of predictions in GNNs under tight constraints.",1
"In this thesis, we develop various techniques for working with sets in machine learning. Each input or output is not an image or a sequence, but a set: an unordered collection of multiple objects, each object described by a feature vector. Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs. Deep learning has recently shown great success on other types of structured data, so we aim to build the necessary structures for sets into deep neural networks.   The first focus of this thesis is the learning of better set representations (sets as input). Existing approaches have bottlenecks that prevent them from properly modeling relations between objects within the set. To address this issue, we develop a variety of techniques for different scenarios and show that alleviating the bottleneck leads to consistent improvements across many experiments.   The second focus of this thesis is the prediction of sets (sets as output). Current approaches do not take the unordered nature of sets into account properly. We determine that this results in a problem that causes discontinuity issues with many set prediction tasks and prevents them from learning some extremely simple datasets. To avoid this problem, we develop two models that properly take the structure of sets into account. Various experiments show that our set prediction techniques can significantly benefit over existing approaches.",0
"This work presents a new approach for representing sets using deep neural networks, allowing them to make predictions on set variables that have no explicit training examples. We show how sets can be encoded as graphs where each element is treated as a node connected by edges, which represent relationships between elements. Our approach first learns the underlying structure of the graph representation through an unsupervised pre-training stage. Then, we use reinforcement learning from human feedback to fine-tune the model for predicting missing set variables. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and interpretability of the learned representations. Our method has potential applications in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems.",1
"An increasing number of machine learning tasks deal with learning representations from set-structured data. Solutions to these problems involve the composition of permutation-equivariant modules (e.g., self-attention, or individual processing via feed-forward neural networks) and permutation-invariant modules (e.g., global average pooling, or pooling by multi-head attention). In this paper, we propose a geometrically-interpretable framework for learning representations from set-structured data, which is rooted in the optimal mass transportation problem. In particular, we treat elements of a set as samples from a probability measure and propose an exact Euclidean embedding for Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) distances to learn from set-structured data effectively. We evaluate our proposed framework on multiple supervised and unsupervised set learning tasks and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art set representation learning approaches.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to set representation learning using generalized sliced-Wasserstein embeddings (GSWE). The proposed method extends classical sliced-Wasserstein distance to better handle high-dimensional data by incorporating additional structure from tensorial representations. GSWE further enables computationally efficient embedding learning through regularization techniques inspired by deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets across diverse applications including image retrieval, outlier detection, and clustering.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for node classification on graphs. The vast majority of existing works assume that genuine node labels are always provided for training. However, there has been very little research effort on how to improve the robustness of GNNs in the presence of label noise. Learning with label noise has been primarily studied in the context of image classification, but these techniques cannot be directly applied to graph-structured data, due to two major challenges -- label sparsity and label dependency -- faced by learning on graphs. In this paper, we propose a new framework, UnionNET, for learning with noisy labels on graphs under a semi-supervised setting. Our approach provides a unified solution for robustly training GNNs and performing label correction simultaneously. The key idea is to perform label aggregation to estimate node-level class probability distributions, which are used to guide sample reweighting and label correction. Compared with existing works, UnionNET has two appealing advantages. First, it requires no extra clean supervision, or explicit estimation of the noise transition matrix. Second, a unified learning framework is proposed to robustly train GNNs in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that our proposed approach: (1) is effective in improving model robustness against different types and levels of label noise; (2) yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks involving graphs such as social networks, chemical compounds, and knowledge graphs. However, these models can be sensitive to label noise, which occurs when training labels contain errors. Existing methods for tackling label noise typically rely either on assumptions that are unrealistic or require strong prior knowledge about data distributions. In contrast, our work proposes a new approach called Unified Robust Training (URT), which addresses both node classification and edge prediction problems under noisy labels without any prior assumption. We demonstrate the effectiveness of URT by applying it to several benchmark datasets across different domains, including citation networks, co-purchase networks, and bioinformatics data. Our results show that URT significantly outperforms other robust learning algorithms even when the label noise ratio reaches up to 50%. Overall, our research advances the field of graph neural network training by providing a simple yet effective solution for handling label noise in real-world applications.",1
"While most neural generative models generate outputs in a single pass, the human creative process is usually one of iterative building and refinement. Recent work has proposed models of editing processes, but these mostly focus on editing sequential data and/or only model a single editing pass. In this paper, we present a generic model for incremental editing of structured data (i.e., ""structural edits""). Particularly, we focus on tree-structured data, taking abstract syntax trees of computer programs as our canonical example. Our editor learns to iteratively generate tree edits (e.g., deleting or adding a subtree) and applies them to the partially edited data, thereby the entire editing process can be formulated as consecutive, incremental tree transformations. To show the unique benefits of modeling tree edits directly, we further propose a novel edit encoder for learning to represent edits, as well as an imitation learning method that allows the editor to be more robust. We evaluate our proposed editor on two source code edit datasets, where results show that, with the proposed edit encoder, our editor significantly improves accuracy over previous approaches that generate the edited program directly in one pass. Finally, we demonstrate that training our editor to imitate experts and correct its mistakes dynamically can further improve its performance.",0
"This is not how you write an academic abstract. You need to provide some context first: Explain the importance of structural editing, why incremental tree transformations can play a role, summarize your key ideas (e.g., that it allows editors to work on parts of trees instead of having to rebuild them from scratch), explain your methods and results (and their significance). Don’t forget to close by stating the takeaways of your study (or at least one possible) and end with brief acknowledgements if any contributors or funders were involved. A well written abstract should draw in readers who would benefit from reading your full paper. Start with something like “Structural editing refers to…” as most search committees won’t know what it means off the bat (though some might argue they shouldn’t have to read past page one in such a case ; )  . I hope these tips assist! Let me know if there’s more I can do.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for analyzing graph-structured data. Most GNN methods are highly sensitive to the quality of graph structures and usually require a perfect graph structure for learning informative embeddings. However, the pervasiveness of noise in graphs necessitates learning robust representations for real-world problems. To improve the robustness of GNN models, many studies have been proposed around the central concept of Graph Structure Learning (GSL), which aims to jointly learn an optimized graph structure and corresponding representations. Towards this end, in the presented survey, we broadly review recent progress of GSL methods for learning robust representations. Specifically, we first formulate a general paradigm of GSL, and then review state-of-the-art methods classified by how they model graph structures, followed by applications that incorporate the idea of GSL in other graph tasks. Finally, we point out some issues in current studies and discuss future directions.",0
"In recent years, deep graph structure learning has emerged as an important research topic within machine learning. As we enter a new era where artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more prevalent in our everyday lives, developing methods that can effectively represent complex data structures becomes increasingly crucial. With advancements in computing power and parallel processing architectures, there have been significant efforts towards understanding the importance of graph representation techniques such as Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Attention Models. These models take into account both local and global connections across graphs which allows them to capture hierarchical knowledge at multiple scales, making them robust against noise and perturbation. This survey focuses on reviewing these state-of-the-art deep graph structure learning algorithms and their applications, examining their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. By exploring existing approaches, this work seeks to provide insights into areas requiring further investigation and potential opportunities for future developments.",1
"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their variants have achieved great success in dealing with graph-structured data. However, it is well known that deep GCNs will suffer from over-smoothing problem, where node representations tend to be indistinguishable as we stack up more layers. Although extensive research has confirmed this prevailing understanding, few theoretical analyses have been conducted to study the expressivity and trainability of deep GCNs. In this work, we demonstrate these characterizations by studying the Gaussian Process Kernel (GPK) and Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) of an infinitely-wide GCN, corresponding to the analysis on expressivity and trainability, respectively. We first prove the expressivity of infinitely-wide GCNs decaying at an exponential rate by applying the mean-field theory on GPK. Besides, we formulate the asymptotic behaviors of GNTK in the large depth, which enables us to reveal the dropping trainability of wide and deep GCNs at an exponential rate. Additionally, we extend our theoretical framework to analyze residual connection-resemble techniques. We found that these techniques can mildly mitigate exponential decay, but they failed to overcome it fundamentally. Finally, all theoretical results in this work are corroborated experimentally on a variety of graph-structured datasets.",0
"This research investigates the impact of graph neural networks on trainability loss through aggregation methods. By evaluating common aggregation techniques used in wide graph neural networks (WGNN), we found that there exists a significant trade-off between expressivity and trainability. Specifically, as the size of a GNN model grows larger, training becomes exponentially more difficult due to the increased complexity of the architecture. However, we discovered that applying appropriate aggregation techniques can mitigate this issue by allowing for faster convergence during training. Our results demonstrate that carefully chosen aggregation methods lead to significantly improved performance across multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining comparable accuracy to models without aggregation. Overall, our findings suggest that understanding the intricacies of how graphs are processed can greatly benefit practitioners looking to design effective GNN architectures for their particular domains.",1
"Most existing set encoding algorithms operate under the assumption that all the elements of the set are accessible during training and inference. Additionally, it is assumed that there are enough computational resources available for concurrently processing sets of large cardinality. However, both assumptions fail when the cardinality of the set is prohibitively large such that we cannot even load the set into memory. In more extreme cases, the set size could be potentially unlimited, and the elements of the set could be given in a streaming manner, where the model receives subsets of the full set data at irregular intervals. To tackle such practical challenges in large-scale set encoding, we go beyond the usual constraints of invariance and equivariance and introduce a new property termed Mini-Batch Consistency that is required for large scale mini-batch set encoding. We present a scalable and efficient set encoding mechanism that is amenable to mini-batch processing with respect to set elements and capable of updating set representations as more data arrives. The proposed method respects the required symmetries of invariance and equivariance as well as being Mini-Batch Consistent for random partitions of the input set. We perform extensive experiments and show that our method is computationally efficient and results in rich set encoding representations for set-structured data.",0
"Title: ""Mini-batch Consistent Slot Set Encoder for Scalable Set Encoding""  Abstract: In natural language processing tasks, such as machine reading comprehension (MRC) and question answering, one common challenge is encoding sets of objects into fixed-length vectors that can capture their semantic meaning while also remaining scalable. In practice, slot set encoders require large amounts of memory due to the use of full matrix operations, which makes them impractical for handling larger datasets. To address these limitations, we propose the mini-batch consistent slot set encoder (MCSE), which effectively utilizes mini-batch gradient descent optimization to encode each object separately while ensuring consistency across all possible combinations. Our method significantly reduces memory usage compared to existing methods without sacrificing accuracy. Through extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including WikiReading and TyDiQA, we demonstrate that MCSE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches while scaling better to larger dataset sizes. Overall, our work contributes towards enabling more efficient and effective natural language processing models on large scale data distributions.",1
"\textit{Attention} computes the dependency between representations, and it encourages the model to focus on the important selective features. Attention-based models, such as Transformer and graph attention network (GAT), are widely utilized for sequential data and graph-structured data. This paper suggests a new interpretation and generalized structure of the attention in Transformer and GAT. For the attention in Transformer and GAT, we derive that the attention is a product of two parts: 1) the RBF kernel to measure the similarity of two instances and 2) the exponential of $L^{2}$ norm to compute the importance of individual instances. From this decomposition, we generalize the attention in three ways. First, we propose implicit kernel attention with an implicit kernel function instead of manual kernel selection. Second, we generalize $L^{2}$ norm as the $L^{p}$ norm. Third, we extend our attention to structured multi-head attention. Our generalized attention shows better performance on classification, translation, and regression tasks.",0

Here is my attempt at summarizing the content of your paper:  ""This paper presents a new method for implicit kernel attention that enables efficient processing and analysis of high-dimensional data. Our approach leverages deep neural networks to learn complex representations of input features, while simultaneously attending to relevant subspaces of varying sizes and shapes. By using implicit regularization techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark tasks without relying on explicit constraints or heuristics. In particular, our results demonstrate significant improvements over strong baseline models across a range of applications including image classification, speech recognition, and language modeling.""",1
"As a new approach to train generative models, \emph{generative adversarial networks} (GANs) have achieved considerable success in image generation. This framework has also recently been applied to data with graph structures. We propose labeled-graph generative adversarial networks (LGGAN) to train deep generative models for graph-structured data with node labels. We test the approach on various types of graph datasets, such as collections of citation networks and protein graphs. Experiment results show that our model can generate diverse labeled graphs that match the structural characteristics of the training data and outperforms all alternative approaches in quality and generality. To further evaluate the quality of the generated graphs, we use them on a downstream task of graph classification, and the results show that LGGAN can faithfully capture the important aspects of the graph structure.",0
"Recently, graph representation learning has gained significant attention due to its ability to effectively capture complex structured data. One popular approach is based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN), which can learn expressive features directly from raw graphs. However, these methods often struggle to generalize well beyond the training distribution, leading to poor performance in few shot settings. To overcome such limitations, we propose Labeled Graph Generative Adversarial Networks (LGANs) that combine generative modeling and adversarial training to synthesize novel, realistic labeled graphs with diverse structures and node attributes. Our framework involves two competing networks: a generator network G that produces labeled graphs and a discriminator network D that evaluates their quality by comparing them against real graphs. We train both networks jointly using a minimax game whereby our goal is to make the generated graphs indistinguishable from real ones. In addition, we introduce a novel architecture called Message Passing Block (MPB) within G for message propagation across multiple hops in the graph. MPB enables efficient computation while preserving permutation equivariance, crucial properties for many graph analytic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results achieved by our LGANs on several benchmark datasets including social circles detection, semantic scene completion, and image generation. For example, given only a small number of examples per class during testing, LGANs substantially outperforms existing approaches like GCNNs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other models designed for generating graphs or images. In summary, our work develops effective labe",1
"This paper introduces CloudLSTM, a new branch of recurrent neural models tailored to forecasting over data streams generated by geospatial point-cloud sources. We design a Dynamic Point-cloud Convolution (DConv) operator as the core component of CloudLSTMs, which performs convolution directly over point-clouds and extracts local spatial features from sets of neighboring points that surround different elements of the input. This operator maintains the permutation invariance of sequence-to-sequence learning frameworks, while representing neighboring correlations at each time step -- an important aspect in spatiotemporal predictive learning. The DConv operator resolves the grid-structural data requirements of existing spatiotemporal forecasting models and can be easily plugged into traditional LSTM architectures with sequence-to-sequence learning and attention mechanisms. We apply our proposed architecture to two representative, practical use cases that involve point-cloud streams, i.e., mobile service traffic forecasting and air quality indicator forecasting. Our results, obtained with real-world datasets collected in diverse scenarios for each use case, show that CloudLSTM delivers accurate long-term predictions, outperforming a variety of competitor neural network models.",0

Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in both accuracy and efficiency. In conclusion, our work advances the field of predictive modeling and has important implications for applications such as autonomous drones and robotics where real-time decision making is crucial.",1
"Our interest is in scientific problems with the following characteristics: (1) Data are naturally represented as graphs; (2) The amount of data available is typically small; and (3) There is significant domain-knowledge, usually expressed in some symbolic form. These kinds of problems have been addressed effectively in the past by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), by virtue of 2 important characteristics: (a) The use of a representation language that easily captures the relation encoded in graph-structured data, and (b) The inclusion of prior information encoded as domain-specific relations, that can alleviate problems of data scarcity, and construct new relations. Recent advances have seen the emergence of deep neural networks specifically developed for graph-structured data (Graph-based Neural Networks, or GNNs). While GNNs have been shown to be able to handle graph-structured data, less has been done to investigate the inclusion of domain-knowledge. Here we investigate this aspect of GNNs empirically by employing an operation we term ""vertex-enrichment"" and denote the corresponding GNNs as ""VEGNNs"". Using over 70 real-world datasets and substantial amounts of symbolic domain-knowledge, we examine the result of vertex-enrichment across 5 different variants of GNNs. Our results provide support for the following: (a) Inclusion of domain-knowledge by vertex-enrichment can significantly improve the performance of a GNN. That is, the performance VEGNNs is significantly better than GNNs across all GNN variants; (b) The inclusion of domain-specific relations constructed using ILP improves the performance of VEGNNs, across all GNN variants. Taken together, the results provide evidence that it is possible to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge into a GNN, and that ILP can play an important role in providing high-level relationships that are not easily discovered by a GNN.",0
"Artificial intelligence research has made significant progress in recent years due to advancements in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and graph neural networks (GNN). GNNs have emerged as powerful models for handling structured data, including graphs, but one limitation of these models is that they require large amounts of labeled training data to perform well. This paper proposes incorporating symbolic domain knowledge into GNNs to improve their performance on small datasets. Our method first uses natural language processing techniques to extract features from textual descriptions of nodes in the graph and then combines these symbolic representations with node features learned by the GNN model. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it significantly improves classification accuracy compared to baseline GNN models. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating symbolic domain knowledge into GNN models, enabling them to learn more effectively even when limited amounts of labeled data are available. The proposed approach paves the way towards more generalizable and explainable artificial intelligence systems that can operate across different domains without relying exclusively on vast quantities of data.",1
"Graph-structured data arise in a variety of real-world context ranging from sensor and transportation to biological and social networks. As a ubiquitous tool to process graph-structured data, spectral graph filters have been used to solve common tasks such as denoising and anomaly detection, as well as design deep learning architectures such as graph neural networks. Despite being an important tool, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the stability properties of spectral graph filters, which are important for designing robust machine learning models. In this paper, we study filter stability and provide a novel and interpretable upper bound on the change of filter output, where the bound is expressed in terms of the endpoint degrees of the deleted and newly added edges, as well as the spatial proximity of those edges. This upper bound allows us to reason, in terms of structural properties of the graph, when a spectral graph filter will be stable. We further perform extensive experiments to verify intuition that can be gained from the bound.",0
"Recently, there has been growing interest in understanding the stability properties of graph filters due to their wide range of applications from signal processing and computer vision to social network analysis and neuroscience. However, despite extensive research on spectral graph filtering, there still exists limited work addressing interpretability of the stability bounds obtained through these methods. This study addresses that gap by providing interpretable stability bounds for spectral graph filters via new uncertainty principles and concentration inequalities derived specifically for graphs. Our proposed framework enables users to quantify the influence of edge uncertainties, noise and sampling density on filter outputs while offering insights into underlying geometric and structural factors affecting the robustness of graph filtering. By extending existing theory to encompass the effects of stochasticity, we contribute towards reliable predictions in complex systems and enable more informed decision making across domains relying on graph filtering techniques. We demonstrate our findings using simulations as well as real data examples ranging from image and biological networks to large scale social graphs.",1
"Machine learning on graph-structured data has attracted high research interest due to the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Most of the proposed GNNs are based on the node homophily, i.e neighboring nodes share similar characteristics. However, in many complex networks, nodes that lie to distant parts of the graph share structurally equivalent characteristics and exhibit similar roles (e.g chemical properties of distant atoms in a molecule, type of social network users). A growing literature proposed representations that identify structurally equivalent nodes. However, most of the existing methods require high time and space complexity. In this paper, we propose VNEstruct, a simple approach, based on entropy measures of the neighborhood's topology, for generating low-dimensional structural representations, that is time-efficient and robust to graph perturbations. Empirically, we observe that VNEstruct exhibits robustness on structural role identification tasks. Moreover, VNEstruct can achieve state-of-the-art performance on graph classification, without incorporating the graph structure information in the optimization, in contrast to GNN competitors.",0
"This paper presents ego-based entropy measures for structural representations on graphs. In recent years, graph theory has become increasingly important as a tool for analyzing social networks, communication systems, and other complex relationships among objects or entities. One challenge faced by researchers in this field is how to effectively quantify the structure and dynamics of these graphs, particularly when they are large and contain a high degree of complexity. This work addresses this problem by proposing a set of novel entropy measures that take into account the perspective of individual nodes (ego) within a given graph. These measures provide valuable insights into the distribution of certain topological properties around each node, enabling new ways to study network structures from the point of view of specific actors or agents. By evaluating real-world datasets using our proposed methodology, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in helping us better understand the nature of complex networks, including their formation, evolution, and function. We conclude by discussing future directions for research in this area and potential applications of our findings across different domains.",1
"Online real estate platforms have become significant marketplaces facilitating users' search for an apartment or a house. Yet it remains challenging to accurately appraise a property's value. Prior works have primarily studied real estate valuation based on hedonic price models that take structured data into account while accompanying unstructured data is typically ignored. In this study, we investigate to what extent an automated visual analysis of apartment floor plans on online real estate platforms can enhance hedonic rent price appraisal. We propose a tailored two-staged deep learning approach to learn price-relevant designs of floor plans from historical price data. Subsequently, we integrate the floor plan predictions into hedonic rent price models that account for both structural and locational characteristics of an apartment. Our empirical analysis based on a unique dataset of 9174 real estate listings suggests that current hedonic models underutilize the available data. We find that (1) the visual design of floor plans has significant explanatory power regarding rent prices - even after controlling for structural and locational apartment characteristics, and (2) harnessing floor plans results in an up to 10.56% lower out-of-sample prediction error. We further find that floor plans yield a particularly high gain in prediction performance for older and smaller apartments. Altogether, our empirical findings contribute to the existing research body by establishing the link between the visual design of floor plans and real estate prices. Moreover, our approach has important implications for online real estate platforms, which can use our findings to enhance user experience in their real estate listings.",0
"This study examines how incorporating floor plans into hedonic models can improve rent price appraisals. Traditional hedonic pricing models assume that all units within a building have similar characteristics. However, differences in floor plan layouts, such as square footage or number of bedrooms and bathrooms, can significantly affect rental prices. By including these variations in the modeling process, we can gain more accurate estimates of rental values. We use a combination of data from real estate listings and transaction records, along with advanced statistical techniques, to develop our models. Our results show that accounting for variation in floor plan features leads to improved accuracy in predicting rent prices. Additionally, we find evidence of nonlinear relationships between certain variables and rent price, suggesting further refinement of hedonic models may be necessary. Overall, our research demonstrates the importance of considering spatial dimensions in property valuation, particularly in today’s competitive housing market where unique floor plans play a crucial role in determining rental rates.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are popular to use for classifying structured data in the context of machine learning. But surprisingly, they are rarely applied to regression problems. In this work, we adopt GNN for a classic but challenging nonlinear regression problem, namely the network localization. Our main findings are in order. First, GNN is potentially the best solution to large-scale network localization in terms of accuracy, robustness and computational time. Second, proper thresholding of the communication range is essential to its superior performance. Simulation results corroborate that the proposed GNN based method outperforms all state-of-the-art benchmarks by far. Such inspiring results are theoretically justified in terms of data aggregation, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) noise removal and low-pass filtering effect, all affected by the threshold for neighbor selection.

"The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) is a well-known density model for directional random variables. The recent surge of the deep embedding methodologies for high-dimensional structured data such as images or texts, aimed at extracting salient directional information, can make the vMF model even more popular. In this article, we will review the vMF model and its mixture, provide detailed recipes of how to train the models, focusing on the maximum likelihood estimators, in Python/PyTorch. In particular, implementation of vMF typically suffers from the notorious numerical issue of the Bessel function evaluation in the density normalizer, especially when the dimensionality is high, and we address the issue using the MPMath library that supports arbitrary precision. For the mixture learning, we provide both minibatch-based large-scale SGD learning, as well as the EM algorithm which is a full batch estimator.

"Graph neural networks have shown superior performance in a wide range of applications providing a powerful representation of graph-structured data. Recent works show that the representation can be further improved by auxiliary tasks. However, the auxiliary tasks for heterogeneous graphs, which contain rich semantic information with various types of nodes and edges, have less explored in the literature. In this paper, to learn graph neural networks on heterogeneous graphs we propose a novel self-supervised auxiliary learning method using meta-paths, which are composite relations of multiple edge types. Our proposed method is learning to learn a primary task by predicting meta-paths as auxiliary tasks. This can be viewed as a type of meta-learning. The proposed method can identify an effective combination of auxiliary tasks and automatically balance them to improve the primary task. Our methods can be applied to any graph neural networks in a plug-in manner without manual labeling or additional data. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the performance of link prediction and node classification on heterogeneous graphs.",0

Our approach learns a shared representation that captures both unique and shared features among all tasks via meta-path based adversarial training. In this way, we reduce interdependence among different tasks and improve individual models’ performance. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvement over baselines under various evaluation metrics.

"Graph attention networks (GATs) have been recognized as powerful tools for learning in graph structured data. However, how to enable the attention mechanisms in GATs to smoothly consider both structural and feature information is still very challenging. In this paper, we propose Graph Joint Attention Networks (JATs) to address the aforementioned challenge. Different from previous attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs), JATs adopt novel joint attention mechanisms which can automatically determine the relative significance between node features and structural coefficients learned from graph topology, when computing the attention scores. Therefore, representations concerning more structural properties can be inferred by JATs. Besides, we theoretically analyze the expressive power of JATs and further propose an improved strategy for the joint attention mechanisms that enables JATs to reach the upper bound of expressive power which every message-passing GNN can ultimately achieve, i.e., 1-WL test. JATs can thereby be seen as most powerful message-passing GNNs. The proposed neural architecture has been extensively tested on widely used benchmarking datasets, and has been compared with state-of-the-art GNNs for various downstream predictive tasks. Experimental results show that JATs achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the testing datasets.",0
"Recently, there has been significant interest in joint attention tasks that involve two individuals interacting towards common goals such as communication or cooperation. In most real world scenarios, the interaction involves continuous exchanges between agents. To handle this type of interaction better, we developed a graph neural network (GNN) model based on message passing architecture called ""GraphJAT"". Our method enables us to capture relationships among multiple parties involved in an interactive task at once by leveraging attention mechanisms across them all simultaneously. By applying masked self attention operations in the edge convolution layers of GNNs, our GraphJAT model allows each agent to selectively attend to specific regions of other parties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via several benchmark datasets including social sciences, human behavior, computer vision and natural language understanding tasks, which shows competitive results compared with state-of-the art methods while maintaining interpretability.

"This research presents a novel approach to designing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks that involves using lookup tables to represent feature maps as graphs. In traditional CNN architectures, filters slide over input images in a sliding window manner to extract local features from neighborhood patches. These extracted features are then combined linearly in different layers of the network. However, such approaches can lead to diluted representations due to pooling operations which reduce spatial resolution by downsampling the feature map. Our proposed method, on the other hand, uses graph representation to capture nonlinear relationships among pixels and preserve spatial information. We use a look up table subnetwork to encode spatial layout into high dimensional embeddings, which captures higher level semantic representations compared to the original images. Then we employ GraphConv operation to perform filtering along edges of the graph, producing more expressive representations than regular convolution. Furthermore, our model benefits greatly from the power of modern deep learning frameworks where the computation graph and gradient flow naturally follow the data through these transformations. Experimental results show consistent performance improvement across multiple datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",1

"Graph-structured data ubiquitously appears in science and engineering. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit the relational inductive bias exhibited in graphs; they have been shown to outperform other forms of neural networks in scenarios where structure information supplements node features. The most common GNN architecture aggregates information from neighborhoods based on message passing. Its generality has made it broadly applicable. In this paper, we focus on a special, yet widely used, type of graphs -- DAGs -- and inject a stronger inductive bias -- partial ordering -- into the neural network design. We propose the \emph{directed acyclic graph neural network}, DAGNN, an architecture that processes information according to the flow defined by the partial order. DAGNN can be considered a framework that entails earlier works as special cases (e.g., models for trees and models updating node representations recurrently), but we identify several crucial components that prior architectures lack. We perform comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies, on representative DAG datasets (i.e., source code, neural architectures, and probabilistic graphical models) and demonstrate the superiority of DAGNN over simpler DAG architectures as well as general graph architectures.",0

Our findings showcase the potential of DAG neural networks for realizing more efficient and effective artificial intelligence systems across diverse applications.",1
"A big mystery in deep learning continues to be the ability of methods to generalize when the number of model parameters is larger than the number of training examples. In this work, we take a step towards a better understanding of the underlying phenomena of Deep Autoencoders (AEs), a mainstream deep learning solution for learning compressed, interpretable, and structured data representations. In particular, we interpret how AEs approximate the data manifold by exploiting their continuous piecewise affine structure. Our reformulation of AEs provides new insights into their mapping, reconstruction guarantees, as well as an interpretation of commonly used regularization techniques. We leverage these findings to derive two new regularizations that enable AEs to capture the inherent symmetry in the data. Our regularizations leverage recent advances in the group of transformation learning to enable AEs to better approximate the data manifold without explicitly defining the group underlying the manifold. Under the assumption that the symmetry of the data can be explained by a Lie group, we prove that the regularizations ensure the generalization of the corresponding AEs. A range of experimental evaluations demonstrate that our methods outperform other state-of-the-art regularization techniques.",0

Finally, we highlight promising future directions such as extending guarantees beyond traditional iid assumptions and leveraging new techniques from generative modeling research. Our focus throughout is on providing clear explanations and intuitions behind theoretical results while demonstrating concrete examples using real world datasets whenever possible.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received considerable attention on graph-structured data learning for a wide variety of tasks. The well-designed propagation mechanism which has been demonstrated effective is the most fundamental part of GNNs. Although most of GNNs basically follow a message passing manner, litter effort has been made to discover and analyze their essential relations. In this paper, we establish a surprising connection between different propagation mechanisms with a unified optimization problem, showing that despite the proliferation of various GNNs, in fact, their proposed propagation mechanisms are the optimal solution optimizing a feature fitting function over a wide class of graph kernels with a graph regularization term. Our proposed unified optimization framework, summarizing the commonalities between several of the most representative GNNs, not only provides a macroscopic view on surveying the relations between different GNNs, but also further opens up new opportunities for flexibly designing new GNNs. With the proposed framework, we discover that existing works usually utilize naive graph convolutional kernels for feature fitting function, and we further develop two novel objective functions considering adjustable graph kernels showing low-pass or high-pass filtering capabilities respectively. Moreover, we provide the convergence proofs and expressive power comparisons for the proposed models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that the proposed GNNs not only outperform the state-of-the-art methods but also have good ability to alleviate over-smoothing, and further verify the feasibility for designing GNNs with our unified optimization framework.",0

In this paper, we propose a novel data analysis framework with reproducing kernel Hilbert $C^*$-module (RKHM) and kernel mean embedding (KME) in RKHM. Since RKHM contains richer information than RKHS or vector-valued RKHS (vv RKHS), analysis with RKHM enables us to capture and extract structural properties in multivariate data, functional data and other structured data. We show a branch of theories for RKHM to apply to data analysis, including the representer theorem, and the injectivity and universality of the proposed KME. We also show RKHM generalizes RKHS and vv RKHS. Then, we provide concrete procedures for employing RKHM and the proposed KME to data analysis.",0

"Graph representation of structured data can facilitate the extraction of stereoscopic features, and it has demonstrated excellent ability when working with deep learning systems, the so-called Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Choosing a promising architecture for constructing GNNs can be transferred to a hyperparameter optimisation problem, a very challenging task due to the size of the underlying search space and high computational cost for evaluating candidate GNNs. To address this issue, this research presents a novel genetic algorithm with a hierarchical evaluation strategy (HESGA), which combines the full evaluation of GNNs with a fast evaluation approach. By using full evaluation, a GNN is represented by a set of hyperparameter values and trained on a specified dataset, and root mean square error (RMSE) will be used to measure the quality of the GNN represented by the set of hyperparameter values (for regression problems). While in the proposed fast evaluation process, the training will be interrupted at an early stage, the difference of RMSE values between the starting and interrupted epochs will be used as a fast score, which implies the potential of the GNN being considered. To coordinate both types of evaluations, the proposed hierarchical strategy uses the fast evaluation in a lower level for recommending candidates to a higher level, where the full evaluation will act as a final assessor to maintain a group of elite individuals. To validate the effectiveness of HESGA, we apply it to optimise two types of deep graph neural networks. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate its advantages compared to Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.",0

"Deep generative models, since their inception, have become increasingly more capable of generating novel and perceptually realistic signals (e.g., images and sound waves). With the emergence of deep models for graph structured data, natural interests seek extensions of these generative models for graphs. Successful extensions were seen recently in the case of learning from a collection of graphs (e.g., protein data banks), but the learning from a single graph has been largely under explored. The latter case, however, is important in practice. For example, graphs in financial and healthcare systems contain so much confidential information that their public accessibility is nearly impossible, but open science in these fields can only advance when similar data are available for benchmarking.   In this work, we propose an approach to generating a doppelganger graph that resembles a given one in many graph properties but nonetheless can hardly be used to reverse engineer the original one, in the sense of a near zero edge overlap. The approach is an orchestration of graph representation learning, generative adversarial networks, and graph realization algorithms. Through comparison with several graph generative models (either parameterized by neural networks or not), we demonstrate that our result barely reproduces the given graph but closely matches its properties. We further show that downstream tasks, such as node classification, on the generated graphs reach similar performance to the use of the original ones.",0
"This paper presents a method for creating a ""doppelganger graph"" using machine learning techniques.

Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving high accuracy on image generation tasks while preserving diversity and uniqueness. Overall, we believe that this work has important implications for computer graphics and art applications, and could potentially lead to more creative and innovative uses of artificial intelligence.",1
"A fundamental problem on graph-structured data is that of quantifying similarity between graphs. Graph kernels are an established technique for such tasks; in particular, those based on random walks and return probabilities have proven to be effective in wide-ranging applications, from bioinformatics to social networks to computer vision. However, random walk kernels generally suffer from slowness and tottering, an effect which causes walks to overemphasize local graph topology, undercutting the importance of global structure. To correct for these issues, we recast return probability graph kernels under the more general framework of density of states -- a framework which uses the lens of spectral analysis to uncover graph motifs and properties hidden within the interior of the spectrum -- and use our interpretation to construct scalable, composite density of states based graph kernels which balance local and global information, leading to higher classification accuracies on a host of benchmark datasets.",0
"Abstract: In this work, we introduce density of states graph kernels (DoSK), a novel approach for graph similarity comparison based on kernel representations of the density of states (DOS) from eigendecomposition techniques. These kernels capture key chemical fingerprints that allow us to effectively compare molecules across different chemotypes and enrich biological interpretations. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance over state-of-the-art graph kernels, validating its potential applications in areas such as virtual screening, drug discovery, and protein structure modeling. By leveraging machine learning models trained with these high-quality features derived from DoSK, we anticipate improved accuracy in predictive tasks related to molecular interactions and their effects on cellular processes. This study broadens the scope of applicability of graph kernels beyond common application domains and paves the way for new perspectives in chemical informatics research.",1
"Lots of neural network architectures have been proposed to deal with learning tasks on graph-structured data. However, most of these models concentrate on only node features during the learning process. The edge features, which usually play a similarly important role as the nodes, are often ignored or simplified by these models. In this paper, we present edge-featured graph attention networks, namely EGATs, to extend the use of graph neural networks to those tasks learning on graphs with both node and edge features. These models can be regarded as extensions of graph attention networks (GATs). By reforming the model structure and the learning process, the new models can accept node and edge features as inputs, incorporate the edge information into feature representations, and iterate both node and edge features in a parallel but mutual way. The results demonstrate that our work is highly competitive against other node classification approaches, and can be well applied in edge-featured graph learning tasks.",0

"There has been a surge of recent interest in learning representations for graph-structured data. Graph representation learning methods have generally fallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data. The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure. However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work. Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g. GraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc) into a single consistent approach. To illustrate the generality of this approach, we fit over thirty existing methods into this framework. We believe that this unifying view both provides a solid foundation for understanding the intuition behind these methods, and enables future research in the area.",0

"Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of interest in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective at processing large volumes of image data.

This paper presents an innovative new approach to address these issues by developing Deep Parameteric Convolutional Neural Networks (DPCN). DPCN is based on the idea of incorporating continuous latent variables into the standard CNN architecture. These continuous latent vectors allow the model to capture non-rigid deformations as well as high order variations, resulting in improved performance across a range of application domains. To validate our methodology, we evaluated our proposed DPCN system on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. Overall, our findings suggest that the integration of continuous representations within conventional CNN architectures provides an effective means of boosting their capabilities, leading to more accurate and robust analysis in challenging scenarios.

"Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have recently demonstrated their potential in analyzing non-grid structure data that can be represented as graphs. The core idea is to encode the local topology of a graph, via convolutions, into the feature of a center node. In this paper, we propose a novel GCN model, which we term as Shortest Path Graph Attention Network (SPAGAN). Unlike conventional GCN models that carry out node-based attentions within each layer, the proposed SPAGAN conducts path-based attention that explicitly accounts for the influence of a sequence of nodes yielding the minimum cost, or shortest path, between the center node and its higher-order neighbors. SPAGAN therefore allows for a more informative and intact exploration of the graph structure and further {a} more effective aggregation of information from distant neighbors into the center node, as compared to node-based GCN methods. We test SPAGAN on the downstream classification task on several standard datasets, and achieve performances superior to the state of the art.

Our model constructs a fully connected graph where each node represents a feature map location and edge weights capture pairwise similarity between nodes. By incorporating shortest paths into our graph construction process, we preserve long range information while keeping computational complexity low enough for scalability on high resolution imagery. We then train an encoder-decoder architecture on these graphs to perform arbitrary visual reasoning tasks such as object detection, segmentation, or pose estimation. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and tasks, we demonstrate how SPAGAN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the art methods.

"A scalable semi-supervised node classification method on graph-structured data, called GraphHop, is proposed in this work. The graph contains attributes of all nodes but labels of a few nodes. The classical label propagation (LP) method and the emerging graph convolutional network (GCN) are two popular semi-supervised solutions to this problem. The LP method is not effective in modeling node attributes and labels jointly or facing a slow convergence rate on large-scale graphs. GraphHop is proposed to its shortcoming. With proper initial label vector embeddings, each iteration of GraphHop contains two steps: 1) label aggregation and 2) label update. In Step 1, each node aggregates its neighbors' label vectors obtained in the previous iteration. In Step 2, a new label vector is predicted for each node based on the label of the node itself and the aggregated label information obtained in Step 1. This iterative procedure exploits the neighborhood information and enables GraphHop to perform well in an extremely small label rate setting and scale well for very large graphs. Experimental results show that GraphHop outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods on a wide range of tasks (e.g., multi-label and multi-class classification on citation networks, social graphs, and commodity consumption graphs) in graphs of various sizes.

"Graph Neural Networks (graph NNs) are a promising deep learning approach for analyzing graph-structured data. However, it is known that they do not improve (or sometimes worsen) their predictive performance as we pile up many layers and add non-lineality. To tackle this problem, we investigate the expressive power of graph NNs via their asymptotic behaviors as the layer size tends to infinity. Our strategy is to generalize the forward propagation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which is a popular graph NN variant, as a specific dynamical system. In the case of a GCN, we show that when its weights satisfy the conditions determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized Laplacian, its output exponentially approaches the set of signals that carry information of the connected components and node degrees only for distinguishing nodes. Our theory enables us to relate the expressive power of GCNs with the topological information of the underlying graphs inherent in the graph spectra. To demonstrate this, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of GCNs on the Erd\H{o}s -- R\'{e}nyi graph. We show that when the Erd\H{o}s -- R\'{e}nyi graph is sufficiently dense and large, a broad range of GCNs on it suffers from the ""information loss"" in the limit of infinite layers with high probability. Based on the theory, we provide a principled guideline for weight normalization of graph NNs. We experimentally confirm that the proposed weight scaling enhances the predictive performance of GCNs in real data. Code is available at https://github.com/delta2323/gnn-asymptotics.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise for node classification on graphs. However, recent work has uncovered limitations in their expressive power for deep learning tasks.

This research investigates why such a limitation occurs by analyzing message passing through graphs using graph theory concepts. We present theoretical evidence that GNNs cannot recover certain global properties of graphs, leading to significant loss of expressive power. Our results show that even adding more layers can only partially mitigate this issue.

"In recent years, ride-hailing services have been increasingly prevalent as they provide huge convenience for passengers. As a fundamental problem, the timely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for effective traffic flow control and route planning. As both spatial and temporal patterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has evolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modeling historical passenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot by connecting region nodes via different relational edges (e.g., origin-destination relationship, geographical distance, etc.). Consequently, the spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in the constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about the directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two connected regions. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to simultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed, and weighted (DDW) graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph representations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with all attention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those three intrinsic properties of DDW graphs, we build three attention layers to fully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across all historical time slots. Moreover, the model employs a subtask to conduct pretraining so that it can obtain accurate results more quickly.

"""This paper proposes bosonic random walk networks (BRWN) as a new method for graph learning."" Title: Bosonic Random Walk Networks for Graph Learning  Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing efficient methods for graph learning, which involves identifying important features from large data sets. One approach that has gained popularity is using random walks on graphs, where each node is randomly selected and visited before moving onto one of its neighbors. However, traditional random walk models have limitations in capturing high dimensional relationships among nodes due to their linear nature. To address these issues, we propose bosonic random walk networks (BRWN), a novel nonlinear extension of classical random walk models.  In BRWN, nodes represent features in the data set while edges represent similarity relations between those features. During the network construction process, each feature visits its connected neighbors with probability proportional to its strength of interaction with other features, resulting in a weighted adjacency matrix. By modeling these weights through bosons, we capture complex interactions among features while retaining the computational simplicity of classic random walk models.  The proposed framework offers several advantages over existing techniques. Firstly, BRWN can effectively handle high-dimensional datasets by leveraging the power of boson sampling algorithms. Secondly, our methodology naturally encodes domain knowledge into the system, enabling incorporation of prior expertise during graph construction. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BRWN compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods across multiple application domains including social network analysis, image classification, and biological pathway discovery.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the subject of intense focus by the machine learning community for problems involving relational reasoning. GNNs can be broadly divided into spatial and spectral approaches. Spatial approaches use a form of learned message-passing, in which interactions among vertices are computed locally, and information propagates over longer distances on the graph with greater numbers of message-passing steps. Spectral approaches use eigendecompositions of the graph Laplacian to produce a generalization of spatial convolutions to graph structured data which access information over short and long time scales simultaneously. Here we introduce the Spectral Graph Network, which applies message passing to both the spatial and spectral domains. Our model projects vertices of the spatial graph onto the Laplacian eigenvectors, which are each represented as vertices in a fully connected ""spectral graph"", and then applies learned message passing to them. We apply this model to various benchmark tasks including a graph-based variant of MNIST classification, molecular property prediction on MoleculeNet and QM9, and shortest path problems on random graphs. Our results show that the Spectral GN promotes efficient training, reaching high performance with fewer training iterations despite having more parameters. The model also provides robustness to edge dropout and outperforms baselines for the classification tasks. We also explore how these performance benefits depend on properties of the dataset.",0

Accordingly, we propose Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA), a novel architecture combining multiple aggregators with degree-scalers (which generalize the sum aggregator). Finally, we compare the capacity of different models to capture and exploit the graph structure via a novel benchmark containing multiple tasks taken from classical graph theory, alongside existing benchmarks from real-world domains, all of which demonstrate the strength of our model.

"When compared to unimodal systems, multimodal biometric systems have several advantages, including lower error rate, higher accuracy, and larger population coverage. However, multimodal systems have an increased demand for integrity and privacy because they must store multiple biometric traits associated with each user. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework for feature-level fusion that generates a secure multimodal template from each user's face and iris biometrics. We integrate a deep hashing (binarization) technique into the fusion architecture to generate a robust binary multimodal shared latent representation. Further, we employ a hybrid secure architecture by combining cancelable biometrics with secure sketch techniques and integrate it with a deep hashing framework, which makes it computationally prohibitive to forge a combination of multiple biometrics that pass the authentication. The efficacy of the proposed approach is shown using a multimodal database of face and iris and it is observed that the matching performance is improved due to the fusion of multiple biometrics. Furthermore, the proposed approach also provides cancelability and unlinkability of the templates along with improved privacy of the biometric data. Additionally, we also test the proposed hashing function for an image retrieval application using a benchmark dataset. The main goal of this paper is to develop a method for integrating multimodal fusion, deep hashing, and biometric security, with an emphasis on structural data from modalities like face and iris. The proposed approach is in no way a general biometric security framework that can be applied to all biometric modalities, as further research is needed to extend the proposed framework to other unconstrained biometric modalities.",0
"Abstract: As biometric authentication becomes increasingly important for secure systems, multimodal biometric methods that rely on multiple types of biometric features (e.g., face recognition and fingerprint matching) have become more popular. One challenge facing these methods, however, is how to hash and compare biometric data while maintaining security against attacks such as replay attacks, where attackers attempt to use previously recorded legitimate data to gain unauthorized access. In this work, we propose deep hashing, a new method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to effectively address this issue. We evaluate our approach using state-of-the-art datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in protecting against both replay and other common attacks. Our results show significant improvements over traditional hashing approaches. By combining deep learning techniques with cryptographic principles, our method can provide improved performance without sacrificing security. This research offers promising solutions for securing real-world applications requiring robust and efficient multimodal biometric authentication.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical representation via message propagation (HRMP) method for robust model fitting, which simultaneously takes advantages of both the consensus analysis and the preference analysis to estimate the parameters of multiple model instances from data corrupted by outliers, for robust model fitting. Instead of analyzing the information of each data point or each model hypothesis independently, we formulate the consensus information and the preference information as a hierarchical representation to alleviate the sensitivity to gross outliers. Specifically, we firstly construct a hierarchical representation, which consists of a model hypothesis layer and a data point layer. The model hypothesis layer is used to remove insignificant model hypotheses and the data point layer is used to remove gross outliers. Then, based on the hierarchical representation, we propose an effective hierarchical message propagation (HMP) algorithm and an improved affinity propagation (IAP) algorithm to prune insignificant vertices and cluster the remaining data points, respectively. The proposed HRMP can not only accurately estimate the number and parameters of multiple model instances, but also handle multi-structural data contaminated with a large number of outliers. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real images show that the proposed HRMP significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art model fitting methods in terms of fitting accuracy and speed.",0
"Machine learning models are often trained on large datasets that contain noise or outliers which can affect their performance. In order to improve model fitting and reduce sensitivity to these data issues, hierarchical representation methods have been developed. These techniques involve representing high-dimensional data as a sequence of lower dimensional representations, where each level captures more semantic meaning than the previous one. However, existing hierarchical representation methods are limited by the need for expensive computational resources, manual feature engineering, and poor scalability across different domains. To address these limitations, we propose a new method called ""Message Passing Neural Networks"" (MPNN) that uses message propagation to learn a hierarchy of representations automatically from raw input data. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark datasets while requiring significantly less computation time and no hand-engineered features. By leveraging message passing principles commonly used in graph neural networks, our method achieves robustness against noise and outliers without sacrificing model accuracy. Overall, MPNN presents a novel and effective solution for hierarchical representation and model fitting, opening up exciting opportunities for future research in machine learning and computer vision.",1
"Semi-supervised node classification on graph-structured data has many applications such as fraud detection, fake account and review detection, user's private attribute inference in social networks, and community detection. Various methods such as pairwise Markov Random Fields (pMRF) and graph neural networks were developed for semi-supervised node classification. pMRF is more efficient than graph neural networks. However, existing pMRF-based methods are less accurate than graph neural networks, due to a key limitation that they assume a heuristics-based constant edge potential for all edges. In this work, we aim to address the key limitation of existing pMRF-based methods. In particular, we propose to learn edge potentials for pMRF. Our evaluation results on various types of graph datasets show that our optimized pMRF-based method consistently outperforms existing graph neural networks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our results highlight that previous work may have underestimated the power of pMRF for semi-supervised node classification.",0
"In recent years, semi-supervised node classification on graphs has gained increasing attention due to the rapid growth of data in complex systems such as social networks, biological networks, and knowledge bases. Two popular approaches for addressing this problem are Markov random fields (MRF) and graph neural networks (GNN). Although both MRFs and GNNs have been widely used in practice, their relative merits remain unclear, especially regarding efficiency and accuracy. This work compares MRFs and GNNs in terms of unlabelled data utilization, computational efficiency, scalability, robustness against noisy labels, flexibility and interpretability, and the ability to model high order interactions. Our results show that while both methods perform well overall, GNNs offer notable advantages over MRFs in most aspects, making them more suitable for many real-world applications. These findings contribute towards better understanding of how to design effective semi-supervised learning algorithms on graphs using different techniques.",1
"Mesh is a powerful data structure for 3D shapes. Representation learning for 3D meshes is important in many computer vision and graphics applications. The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for structured data (e.g., images) suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN for 3D shapes. However, 3D shape data are irregular since each node's neighbors are unordered. Various graph neural networks for 3D shapes have been developed with isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems to overcome the node inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems limit the representation power. In this paper, we propose a local structure-aware anisotropic convolutional operation (LSA-Conv) that learns adaptive weighting matrices for each node according to the local neighboring structure and performs shared anisotropic filters. In fact, the learnable weighting matrix is similar to the attention matrix in the random synthesizer -- a new Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model produces significant improvement in 3D shape reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for learning local neighboring structure from point clouds that robustly captures shape representation under various transformations such as scaling, translation, rotation, reflection, and occlusion. Our approach uses graph convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on graphs constructed from unordered point sets to encode spatial features into low-dimensional representations. By leveraging explicit data augmentation during training time, we can capture the distribution of these transformations and learn a strong prior over shape spaces. Experiments show our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets for tasks including registration, retrieval, and classification. Furthermore, thanks to the ability of encoding global shape structures, it demonstrates superior performance than traditional voxel-based techniques when handling objects with fine details like hairs and fibers. In summary, by incorporating local geometric relationships via graph CNNs and enforcing generalization through appropriate data augmentations, our framework learns a highly discriminative and robust model for accurate point cloud analysis.",1
"Spectral graph convolutional networks are generalizations of standard convolutional networks for graph-structured data using the Laplacian operator. A common misconception is the instability of spectral filters, i.e. the impossibility to transfer spectral filters between graphs of variable size and topology. This misbelief has limited the development of spectral networks for multi-graph tasks in favor of spatial graph networks. However, recent works have proved the stability of spectral filters under graph perturbation. Our work complements and emphasizes further the high quality of spectral transferability by benchmarking spectral graph networks on tasks involving graphs of different size and connectivity. Numerical experiments exhibit favorable performance on graph regression, graph classification, and node classification problems on two graph benchmarks. The implementation of our experiments is available on GitHub for reproducibility.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to many fields due to their effectiveness in processing irregular data structures such as graphs. One promising approach within GNNs is spectral methods, which utilize the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian to learn node representations that capture global properties of the graph structure. However, there has been limited research on evaluating the transferability of these learned representations across different datasets or tasks. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting an experimental analysis on the transferability of spectral graph network models. We train several popular spectral GNN architectures on multiple benchmark graph datasets and evaluate their performance on downstream node classification and link prediction tasks. Our results show that while spectral graph networks can achieve high accuracy on training tasks, they often struggle to generalize well to new tasks or domains. We provide insights into factors that may influence the transferability of these models, such as dataset size and model complexity. Overall, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the limitations and potential applications of spectral graph networks.",1
"Named Entity Recognition has been extensively investigated in many fields. However, the application of sensitive entity detection for production systems in financial institutions has not been well explored due to the lack of publicly available, labeled datasets. In this paper, we use internal and synthetic datasets to evaluate various methods of detecting NPI (Nonpublic Personally Identifiable) information commonly found within financial institutions, in both unstructured and structured data formats. Character-level neural network models including CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM-CRF, and CNN-CRF are investigated on two prediction tasks: (i) entity detection on multiple data formats, and (ii) column-wise entity prediction on tabular datasets. We compare these models with other standard approaches on both real and synthetic data, with respect to F1-score, precision, recall, and throughput. The real datasets include internal structured data and public email data with manually tagged labels. Our experimental results show that the CNN model is simple yet effective with respect to accuracy and throughput and thus, is the most suitable candidate model to be deployed in the production environment(s). Finally, we provide several lessons learned on data limitations, data labelling and the intrinsic overlap of data entities.",0
"In today's fast-paced world of finance, data security has never been more important. With cyber attacks becoming increasingly commonplace, financial institutions must take every precaution to protect their sensitive data from unauthorized access. One critical aspect of data security is identifying sensitive data in real time before it falls into the wrong hands. This paper presents high-throughput neural network models that can quickly detect and classify sensitive data within large datasets, allowing for proactive measures to prevent breaches. By training these models on vast amounts of labeled data, we achieve state-of-the art results in accuracy, speed, and scalability. Our approach employs an ensemble methodology, leveraging multiple models to increase robustness and reduce errors. We present detailed experimental evaluation of our system using benchmark datasets as well as case studies with several major banks. Overall, our work shows that deep learning techniques have significant potential in helping financial institutions improve their data protection strategies.",1
"Graph representation learning has many real-world applications, from super-resolution imaging, 3D computer vision to drug repurposing, protein classification, social networks analysis. An adequate representation of graph data is vital to the learning performance of a statistical or machine learning model for graph-structured data. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale representation system for graph data, called decimated framelets, which form a localized tight frame on the graph. The decimated framelet system allows storage of the graph data representation on a coarse-grained chain and processes the graph data at multi scales where at each scale, the data is stored at a subgraph. Based on this, we then establish decimated G-framelet transforms for the decomposition and reconstruction of the graph data at multi resolutions via a constructive data-driven filter bank. The graph framelets are built on a chain-based orthonormal basis that supports fast graph Fourier transforms. From this, we give a fast algorithm for the decimated G-framelet transforms, or FGT, that has linear computational complexity O(N) for a graph of size N. The theory of decimated framelets and FGT is verified with numerical examples for random graphs. The effectiveness is demonstrated by real-world applications, including multiresolution analysis for traffic network, and graph neural networks for graph classification tasks.",0
"This paper presents a novel decimation approach called Decimated Frames on Graphs (DG) that can quickly transform signals defined over irregular domains onto a lower dimensional representation for computational efficiency. By using graph theory concepts and framelets, DG provides a localized spectral analysis of irregular signal data such as images. With further mathematical tools, our method generalizes traditional sampling patterns like linear indices or radial frequencies on cartesian grids to irregular graphs and non-euclidean spaces. Experiments show that our fast algorithm significantly accelerates computation times while maintaining high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Most of the existing coastal flood Forecast and Early-Warning Systems do not model the flood, but instead, rely on the prediction of hydrodynamic conditions at the coast and on expert judgment. Recent scientific contributions are now capable to precisely model flood events, even in situations where wave overtopping plays a significant role. Such models are nevertheless costly-to-evaluate and surrogate ones need to be exploited for substantial computational savings. For the latter models, the hydro-meteorological forcing conditions (inputs) or flood events (outputs) are conveniently parametrised into scalar representations. However, they neglect the fact that inputs are actually functions (more precisely, time series), and that floods spatially propagate inland. Here, we introduce a multi-output Gaussian process model accounting for both criteria. On various examples, we test its versatility for both learning spatial maps and inferring unobserved ones. We demonstrate that efficient implementations are obtained by considering tensor-structured data and/or sparse-variational approximations. Finally, the proposed framework is applied on a coastal application aiming at predicting flood events. We conclude that accurate predictions are obtained in the order of minutes rather than the couples of days required by dedicated hydrodynamic simulators.",0
"Title: Multi-Output Gaussian Processes with Functional Data: A Study on Coastal Flood Hazard Assessment Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have become increasingly popular as probabilistic models due to their flexibility and ability to capture complex relationships between inputs and outputs. In many real world applications, such as coastal flood hazard assessment, multiple outcomes need to be modeled simultaneously. This work proposes multi-output Gaussian processes (MOP GPs), which can jointly model correlated multiple outputs using functional data. MOP GPs allow us to exploit the similarities among different tasks by sharing some hyperparameters across tasks while still allowing each task to have unique characteristics. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through a case study on coastal flood hazard assessment in Italy, where we consider three dependent variables related to coastal flooding. Our results show that MOP GPs perform well compared to single output GPs, providing improved predictions for the considered variables. Moreover, sensitivity analysis reveals the most influential factors affecting coastal flood risk along the Italian coastline. Overall, this research extends the scope of GP regression beyond traditional pointwise prediction problems and highlights the potential benefits of incorporating functional data into the framework.",1
"Class imbalance is a challenging issue in practical classification problems for deep learning models as well as for traditional models. Traditionally successful countermeasures such as synthetic over-sampling have had limited success with complex, structured data handled by deep learning models. In this work, we propose to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) equipped with a generator network G, a discriminator network D and a classifier network C to remove the class-imbalance in visual data sets. The generator network is initialized with auto-encoder to make it stable. The discriminator D ensures that G adheres to class distribution of imbalanced class. In conventional methods, where Generator G competes with discriminator D in a min-max game, we propose to further add an additional classifier network to the original network. Now, the generator network tries to compete in a min-max game with Discriminator as well as the new classifier that we have introduced. An additional condition is enforced on generator network G to produce points in the convex hull of desired imbalanced class. Further the contention of adversarial game with classifier C, pushes conditional distribution learned by G towards the periphery of the respective class, compensating the problem of class imbalance. Experimental evidence shows that this initialization results in stable training of the network. We achieve state of the art performance on extreme visual classification task on the FashionMNIST, MNIST, SVHN, ExDark, MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, Chest X-Ray dataset and others.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown great potential in solving many real world problems by learning from large amounts of data. However, there exists a fundamental challenge in ensuring that these algorithms generalize well enough to perform on new unseen data sets as accurately as possible. One major source of error is due to the class imbalances present within datasets which can lead to degraded performance of machine learning models. This paper presents a novel framework capable of removing class imbalance based on uncertainty sampling. We apply our method, called polarity generative adversarial networks (Polarity-GAN), in combination with convolutional neural network architectures (CNNs). Our approach seeks to improve upon past state-of-the-art methods, like random oversampling/undersampling, by optimizing the selection of samples for training through uncertainty sampling. Experiments demonstrate Polarity-GAN produces superior results compared to traditional approaches across multiple domains including natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition and computer vision object detection. Ultimately, we believe this research has positive implications toward improving the robustness of artificial intelligence systems by addressing sources of error caused by class imbalanced data distribution.",1
"Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have vulnerabilities related to security concerns, with attackers usually employing complex hacking techniques to expose their structures. Data poisoning-enabled perturbation attacks are complex adversarial ones that inject false data into models. They negatively impact the learning process, with no benefit to deeper networks, as they degrade a model's accuracy and convergence rates. In this paper, we propose an attack-agnostic-based defense method for mitigating their influence. In it, a Defensive Feature Layer (DFL) is integrated with a well-known DNN architecture which assists in neutralizing the effects of illegitimate perturbation samples in the feature space. To boost the robustness and trustworthiness of this method for correctly classifying attacked input samples, we regularize the hidden space of a trained model with a discriminative loss function called Polarized Contrastive Loss (PCL). It improves discrimination among samples in different classes and maintains the resemblance of those in the same class. Also, we integrate a DFL and PCL in a compact model for defending against data poisoning attacks. This method is trained and tested using the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets with data poisoning-enabled perturbation attacks, with the experimental results revealing its excellent performance compared with those of recent peer techniques.",0
"As deep neural networks (DNN) have become increasingly popular in various applications such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition, they have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These attacks can cause DNNs to produce incorrect results by deliberately crafting inputs that result in misclassifications. While significant progress has been made on understanding the nature of these attacks and developing methods to mitigate them, there remains a gap in our ability to effectively combat adversarial examples for very deep networks. This paper focuses on addressing this challenge through the development of novel defense mechanisms tailored specifically for very deep networks. Our approach utilizes a combination of adversarial training techniques together with network architecture modifications to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methodology in significantly reducing the impact of adversarial attacks on very deep networks while maintaining their overall performance on clean test data. By providing new insights into adversarial attack mitigation strategies for very deep networks, we aim to encourage further research in this area towards ensuring the reliability and security of deep learning systems in real-world applications.",1
"Self-supervised learning is currently gaining a lot of attention, as it allows neural networks to learn robust representations from large quantities of unlabeled data. Additionally, multi-task learning can further improve representation learning by training networks simultaneously on related tasks, leading to significant performance improvements. In this paper, we propose three novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks to train graph-based neural network models in a multi-task fashion. Since Graph Convolutional Networks are among the most promising approaches for capturing relationships among structured data points, we use them as a building block to achieve competitive results on standard semi-supervised graph classification tasks.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for processing complex data structures such as graphs and hypergraphs. These models leverage deep learning techniques like convolutional filters to capture local structure while maintaining global representations, making them ideal for tasks such as node classification on large scale real world datasets. However, training GNNs can still present challenges due to issues related to overfitting and poor generalization performance. To address these concerns, previous research has explored self supervision, where additional auxiliary tasks provide supervisory signals that enhance model robustness during training without requiring explicit annotations from human annotators. This work presents a methodology that incorporates multiple self-supervised auxiliary tasks into the training pipeline for graph-based neural network models. By using several small-scale self-supervised tasks, our approach reduces reliance on expensive task-specific annotated datasets while improving final model quality across several benchmark datasets commonly used to evaluate graph neural network models. We show through comprehensive experiments that our approach significantly outperforms prior art methods utilizing either single auxiliary or multi-task approaches across a wide range of performance metrics including accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, ROC Area Under Curve (AUC), AUPR, and mean average precision (mAP). Additionally, we demonstrate how our framework generalizes well across domains by evaluating its efficacy across multiple datasets common in natural language processing (NLP) applications. Our contributions enable the wider adoption of GNNs for practitioners seeking high-quality results with limited labeled dat",1
"Understanding the reasons for the success of deep neural networks trained using stochastic gradient-based methods is a key open problem for the nascent theory of deep learning. The types of data where these networks are most successful, such as images or sequences of speech, are characterised by intricate correlations. Yet, most theoretical work on neural networks does not explicitly model training data, or assumes that elements of each data sample are drawn independently from some factorised probability distribution. These approaches are thus by construction blind to the correlation structure of real-world data sets and their impact on learning in neural networks. Here, we introduce a generative model for structured data sets that we call the hidden manifold model (HMM). The idea is to construct high-dimensional inputs that lie on a lower-dimensional manifold, with labels that depend only on their position within this manifold, akin to a single layer decoder or generator in a generative adversarial network. We demonstrate that learning of the hidden manifold model is amenable to an analytical treatment by proving a ""Gaussian Equivalence Property"" (GEP), and we use the GEP to show how the dynamics of two-layer neural networks trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent is captured by a set of integro-differential equations that track the performance of the network at all times. This permits us to analyse in detail how a neural network learns functions of increasing complexity during training, how its performance depends on its size and how it is impacted by parameters such as the learning rate or the dimension of the hidden manifold.",0
"Learning in deep artificial neural networks has been shown to depend critically on the network architecture, such as the number of layers and units per layer. However, recent studies have suggested that data manipulation techniques can also impact the performance of neural networks. In particular, techniques such as normalization and batch renormalization have been found to improve the stability and accuracy of training in certain settings. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new mathematical framework called the Hidden Manifold Model (HMM) which combines aspects of both data preprocessing and neural network architectures into a single unified formalism. This allows us to study the effect of different data structures on the learning process. Our analysis shows that properly designed manifolds can significantly improve generalization performance in feedforward and convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate our theory through extensive empirical evaluation on several benchmark datasets from computer vision and natural language processing domains. Overall, the proposed approach provides a new perspective on how to optimize the performance of modern machine learning systems.",1
"Many modern data analyses benefit from explicitly modeling dependence structure in data -- such as measurements across time or space, ordered words in a sentence, or genes in a genome. A gold standard evaluation technique is structured cross-validation (CV), which leaves out some data subset (such as data within a time interval or data in a geographic region) in each fold. But CV here can be prohibitively slow due to the need to re-run already-expensive learning algorithms many times. Previous work has shown approximate cross-validation (ACV) methods provide a fast and provably accurate alternative in the setting of empirical risk minimization. But this existing ACV work is restricted to simpler models by the assumptions that (i) data across CV folds are independent and (ii) an exact initial model fit is available. In structured data analyses, both these assumptions are often untrue. In the present work, we address (i) by extending ACV to CV schemes with dependence structure between the folds. To address (ii), we verify -- both theoretically and empirically -- that ACV quality deteriorates smoothly with noise in the initial fit. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of our proposed methods on a diverse set of real-world applications.",0
"This article presents a framework for performing cross-validation on structured models, such as those commonly used in machine learning applications. We describe how to approximate the true error rate by dividing the dataset into k folds, training the model k times, and using each set of predictions as validation data for the remaining sets. Our method ensures that all instances are eventually both trained and validated. By taking the average of these validation errors, we can estimate the expected test error of our model. Experiments show that our approximation tends to underestimate actual test error but still produces good results even at small sample sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach works well across various types of structured prediction problems including linear regression and decision trees. Overall, our work provides a simple yet effective alternative to existing methods for approximating cross-validation on structured models.",1
"We consider the problem of learning a manifold from a teacher's demonstration. Extending existing approaches of learning from randomly sampled data points, we consider contexts where data may be chosen by a teacher. We analyze learning from teachers who can provide structured data such as individual examples (isolated data points) and demonstrations (sequences of points). Our analysis shows that for the purpose of teaching the topology of a manifold, demonstrations can yield remarkable decreases in the amount of data points required in comparison to teaching with randomly sampled points. We also discuss the implications of our analysis for learning in humans and machines.",0
"In our modern age, we often seek guidance on how to perform certain tasks from others who have expertise in those areas. In this paper, we consider situations where someone may learn from their teachers’ demonstration without explicit verbal instructions. This can happen through careful observation, trial-and-error, and feedback from the teacher. We propose that learning a task through imitation can involve building a “manifold,” which represents all possible variations of the task that could occur in different circumstances. Our model assumes access to a dataset containing multiple examples of the same underlying behavior executed by different experts (teachers) under diverse conditions. Using this data as input, our algorithm learns to predict likely next actions based on current context, generalizing across multiple demonstrations to capture the variability in human behavior. Through experiments on both real and synthetic datasets, we show that this method outperforms alternatives in terms of accuracy, robustness to missing demonstrations, interpretability, and the ability to generalize beyond seen scenarios. Finally, we discuss implications of these findings for understanding how humans might implicitly encode complex behaviors into mental representations and suggest future research directions motivated by connections to cognitive science literature.",1
"Graph-structured data exist in numerous applications in real life. As a state-of-the-art graph neural network, the graph convolutional network (GCN) plays an important role in processing graph-structured data. However, a recent study reported that GCNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which means that GCN models may suffer malicious attacks with unnoticeable modifications of the data. Among all the adversarial attacks on GCNs, there is a special kind of attack method called the universal adversarial attack, which generates a perturbation that can be applied to any sample and causes GCN models to output incorrect results. Although universal adversarial attacks in computer vision have been extensively researched, there are few research works on universal adversarial attacks on graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a targeted universal adversarial attack against GCNs. Our method employs a few nodes as the attack nodes. The attack capability of the attack nodes is enhanced through a small number of fake nodes connected to them. During an attack, any victim node will be misclassified by the GCN as the attack node class as long as it is linked to them. The experiments on three popular datasets show that the average attack success rate of the proposed attack on any victim node in the graph reaches 83% when using only 3 attack nodes and 6 fake nodes. We hope that our work will make the community aware of the threat of this type of attack and raise the attention given to its future defense.",0
"Graph Neural networks (GCNs) have recently emerged as powerful models for graph data, achieving state-of-the-art results in many application domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

In this paper, we present a targeted universal attack method that successfully deceives all 9 benchmark GCN architectures by generating near imperceptible perturbations that fool the classifiers into making incorrect predictions. Our approach leverages gradient estimation techniques from linear systems analysis to efficiently compute adversarial examples without relying on backpropagation. We empirically demonstrate our methods effectiveness across diverse datasets including Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed, showing high attack transferability among different architectures. The feasibility of launching targeted attacks against GCNs calls for further research on developing defense mechanisms capable of mitigating potential security risks posed by these vulnerabilities.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a popular approach for predicting graph structured data. As GNNs tightly entangle the input graph into the neural network structure, common explainable AI approaches are not applicable. To a large extent, GNNs have remained black-boxes for the user so far. In this paper, we show that GNNs can in fact be naturally explained using higher-order expansions, i.e. by identifying groups of edges that jointly contribute to the prediction. Practically, we find that such explanations can be extracted using a nested attribution scheme, where existing techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) can be applied at each step. The output is a collection of walks into the input graph that are relevant for the prediction. Our novel explanation method, which we denote by GNN-LRP, is applicable to a broad range of graph neural networks and lets us extract practically relevant insights on sentiment analysis of text data, structure-property relationships in quantum chemistry, and image classification.",0
"Title: ""Explaining Graph Neural Networks using Higher Order Connections"" Author: ****** Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have gained popularity over recent years due their ability to process graph data such as social networks, molecular structures, and knowledge graphs. Despite their successes, understanding how GNNs make predictions remains challenging, particularly on large graphs where the number of neighbors per node may exceed thousands. In contrast, classical explainability techniques like visualizations based on local features often fail to capture global structure information that might be relevant for prediction tasks. We propose higher order explanations for GNN models by computing relevant walks -- paths through graphs that pass important edges connecting far away nodes which turn out to be crucial for explaining why certain model outputs occur. To evaluate our approach we apply it to several benchmark datasets commonly used to test GNNs, including citation graphs and protein interaction graphs. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over classical baseline approaches, especially for larger graphs where traditional methods struggle, offering new insights into the workings of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms.

"Trust and credibility in machine learning models is bolstered by the ability of a model to explain itsdecisions.

"Deep Learning architectures, albeit successful in most computer vision tasks, were designed for data with an underlying Euclidean structure, which is not usually fulfilled since pre-processed data may lie on a non-linear space. In this paper, we propose a geometry aware deep learning approach for skeleton-based action recognition. Skeleton sequences are first modeled as trajectories on Kendall's shape space and then mapped to the linear tangent space. The resulting structured data are then fed to a deep learning architecture, which includes a layer that optimizes over rigid and non rigid transformations of the 3D skeletons, followed by a CNN-LSTM network. The assessment on two large scale skeleton datasets, namely NTU-RGB+D and NTU-RGB+D 120, has proven that proposed approach outperforms existing geometric deep learning methods and is competitive with respect to recently published approaches.",0

By treating shapes as high-dimensional objects, our model can capture subtle differences in human motion patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed by traditional approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Overall, KShapeNet represents a significant step forward in the field of skeletal action recognition and highlights the promise of Riemannian geometry in computer vision tasks.",1
"Time series are all around in real-world applications. However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.",0
"Title: Time Series Data Imputation: A Survey on Deep Learning Approaches Abstract: Missing data is a common challenge faced by time series forecasting models. To address missing values in datasets, imputation techniques can be used to estimate missing values using available data. Recently, deep learning approaches have emerged as promising solutions for filling in missing data points. This survey reviews state-of-the-art methods that employ deep neural networks (DNNs) for time series data imputation and highlights their advantages over traditional statistical approaches. Firstly, we present several DNN architectures that have been proposed for time series data imputation such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), gated recurrent units (GRUs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Echo State Networks (ESNs). We discuss how these architectures perform compared to traditional imputation methods such as mean, median, regression trees, random forest, autoregression, Kalman filter, ARIMA and SARIMA. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of different loss functions employed during training such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Structured Output Difference Measure (SODM). Additionally, we examine various evaluation metrics utilized in benchmarking experiments including Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), Relative Absolute Scaled Error (RASE), Index of Agreement (IOA) , Accuracy measures and Fill Percentage metrics. Finally, we analyze both qualitative and quantitative research findings from our review of literature studies performed on various real-world applications. We conclude that deep learning approaches hold great potential towards achieving improved accuracy in time series data imputation tasks, offering better estimation results than conventional statistics-based methodologies. Our survey provides insights into future direction",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a popular class of parametric model for learning over graph-structured data. Recent work has argued that GNNs primarily use the graph for feature smoothing, and have shown competitive results on benchmark tasks by simply operating on graph-smoothed node features, rather than using end-to-end learned feature hierarchies that are challenging to scale to large graphs. In this work, we ask whether these results can be extended to heterogeneous graphs, which encode multiple types of relationship between different entities. We propose Neighbor Averaging over Relation Subgraphs (NARS), which trains a classifier on neighbor-averaged features for randomly-sampled subgraphs of the ""metagraph"" of relations. We describe optimizations to allow these sets of node features to be computed in a memory-efficient way, both at training and inference time. NARS achieves a new state of the art accuracy on several benchmark datasets, outperforming more expensive GNN-based methods",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful at handling graph data but they often suffer from high computational complexity due to their reliance on dense matrix operations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable approach based on graph convolutional matrices that can handle heterogeneous graphs efficiently. Our method leverages low-rank approximations and tensorization techniques to reduce memory usage and computation time without sacrificing accuracy. We showcase the effectiveness of our model through experiments on several benchmark datasets including social network analysis and knowledge graph completion tasks. In summary, our work presents an efficient and scalable solution for processing large and complex heterogeneous graphs using GNNs.",1
"A model involving Gaussian processes (GPs) is introduced to simultaneously handle multi-task learning, clustering, and prediction for multiple functional data. This procedure acts as a model-based clustering method for functional data as well as a learning step for subsequent predictions for new tasks. The model is instantiated as a mixture of multi-task GPs with common mean processes. A variational EM algorithm is derived for dealing with the optimisation of the hyper-parameters along with the hyper-posteriors' estimation of latent variables and processes. We establish explicit formulas for integrating the mean processes and the latent clustering variables within a predictive distribution, accounting for uncertainty on both aspects. This distribution is defined as a mixture of cluster-specific GP predictions, which enhances the performances when dealing with group-structured data. The model handles irregular grid of observations and offers different hypotheses on the covariance structure for sharing additional information across tasks. The performances on both clustering and prediction tasks are assessed through various simulated scenarios and real datasets. The overall algorithm, called MagmaClust, is publicly available as an R package.",0
"This paper presents an approach to predicting outcomes for individual cases by modeling each case as a cluster and making predictions using a multi-task Gaussian process prior. We demonstrate that our method can produce more accurate predictions than standard Gaussian processes, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data sets or low sample sizes. Our approach uses an expectation propagation algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution over functions given noisy observations of those functions at training points. By integrating out unobserved functions in our approximation, we effectively pool knowledge across tasks, leading to better generalization performance on heldout test functions. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves predictive accuracy over existing alternatives. Additionally, our approach has several advantages over other kernel methods: it allows us to easily incorporate known structure into the prediction problem (e.g., physical laws); it naturally handles missing data; and it produces non-zero function estimates even when there is little data available. Cluster-specific predictions have emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the accuracy of outcome forecasting models, particularly when addressing complex datasets with limited samples. In this study, we propose a novel framework based on multi-task Gaussian processes, aimed at optimizing predictions by clustering similar instances together and building customized models tailored to each group. By leveraging expectation propagation algorithms to estimate the posterior distribution over functions, considering diverse scenarios simultaneously enables the sharing of insights among various task scenarios, thereby fostering improved overall accuracy compared to traditional approaches. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our solution, emphasizing its potential benefits in real-world applications. Furthermore, the proposed method possesses distinct advantages over conventional kernel techniques, such as flexibility in accommodating structural assumptions, seamless handling of incomplete data, and facilitation of meaningful estimations even under scarce availability of evidence. These merits further enhance the versatility and effectiveness of our methodology in numerous scientific domains.",1
"Graph neural networks~(GNNs) apply deep learning techniques to graph-structured data and have achieved promising performance in graph representation learning. However, existing GNNs rely heavily on enough labels or well-designed negative samples. To address these issues, we propose a new self-supervised graph representation method: deep graph bootstrapping~(DGB). DGB consists of two neural networks: online and target networks, and the input of them are different augmented views of the initial graph. The online network is trained to predict the target network while the target network is updated with a slow-moving average of the online network, which means the online and target networks can learn from each other. As a result, the proposed DGB can learn graph representation without negative examples in an unsupervised manner. In addition, we summarize three kinds of augmentation methods for graph-structured data and apply them to the DGB. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show the DGB performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods and how the augmentation methods affect the performances.",0
"One promising direction of research in deep learning has been graph representation learning (GRL). GRL enables machine learning algorithms on graphs by first encoding nodes as embeddings that capture their relationships to other nodes in the graph. However, obtaining high quality node representations remains challenging due to limitations in supervision. In this work we propose self-supervised bootstrapping methods to learn accurate graph representations. Our approach takes advantage of weakly labeled data and carefully designed pretext tasks to guide the embedding process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation on real world datasets, showing consistent improvement over baselines without relying on large amounts of labeled training data. By integrating both semi-supervised learning and pretext task learning into one framework, we establish new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. This work shows great promise for future research in representation learning on graphs and provides valuable insights for practitioners working on natural language processing applications.",1
"Discrete structures play an important role in applications like program language modeling and software engineering. Current approaches to predicting complex structures typically consider autoregressive models for their tractability, with some sacrifice in flexibility. Energy-based models (EBMs) on the other hand offer a more flexible and thus more powerful approach to modeling such distributions, but require partition function estimation. In this paper we propose ALOE, a new algorithm for learning conditional and unconditional EBMs for discrete structured data, where parameter gradients are estimated using a learned sampler that mimics local search. We show that the energy function and sampler can be trained efficiently via a new variational form of power iteration, achieving a better trade-off between flexibility and tractability. Experimentally, we show that learning local search leads to significant improvements in challenging application domains. Most notably, we present an energy model guided fuzzer for software testing that achieves comparable performance to well engineered fuzzing engines like libfuzzer.",0
"Machine learning algorithms have made significant progress in recent years, but their application remains challenging due to their sensitivity to hyperparameters, difficulty in exploring high dimensions, and limitations in capturing complex relationships between variables. In order to address these issues, researchers have proposed new approaches such as energy-based models (EBMs), which have shown promise in modeling complex distributions and learning from data efficiently. However, current EBM methods suffer from drawbacks such as slow convergence and difficulties in estimating normalization constants. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm called auxiliary-variable local exploration (ALE) that allows efficient optimization of discrete EBMs. Our method uses an adaptive procedure that automatically selects appropriate auxiliary variables based on local gradients, resulting in fast convergence rates while accurately approximating intractable normalization constants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, including image generation, density estimation, and machine translation. Overall, our work provides a promising direction for developing more powerful EBMs that can effectively handle high-dimensional datasets and complex relationships between variables.",1
"Graph-structured data are an integral part of many application domains, including chemoinformatics, computational biology, neuroimaging, and social network analysis. Over the last two decades, numerous graph kernels, i.e. kernel functions between graphs, have been proposed to solve the problem of assessing the similarity between graphs, thereby making it possible to perform predictions in both classification and regression settings. This manuscript provides a review of existing graph kernels, their applications, software plus data resources, and an empirical comparison of state-of-the-art graph kernels.",0
"This is a survey that summarizes and reviews graph kernels. Graph kernels have become popular methods in machine learning applications where structures as graphs can represent complex patterns better than flat vectorial data like matrices. Various types of graphs exist today (social networks, biological networks, web graphs), each representing some interesting but unique problems or datasets. Applying kernel functions on them enables working with high dimensionalities while taking advantage of their properties by designing efficient algorithms. In general kernels provide a mathematical toolbox that can efficiently compare objects using implicit features within spaces of very high dimensions which makes these objects “similar” if compared to others by any positive similarity metrics. On one hand, we know that there has been significant progress in developing new and different kinds of kernels for graphs since their introduction 2 decades ago. These efforts were motivated both by novel large scale real world applications from bioinformatics and chemo informatics, sensor networks etc., but also from more theoretical needs like improving scaling abilities of algorithms. We present many examples of successful applications and techniques along with references, and list several fundamental open challenges for future research directions. As always the challenge remains to balance accuracy of model predictions with tractability of training such models at larger scales involving ever growing sizes of input domains. Thus scalabilty issues remain important topics as well. Finally as deep leaning revolutionized neural network architectures recently it may inspire novel ideas that use similar principles to make kernel methods more powerful by capturing hierarchical relations. We aim towards comprehensive review, though there might still be some gaps we cannot bridge because of the vastness of relevant publications existing globally or the limited time horizon during which our work was conducted. Our paper provides extensive literature surveys of key technical points which should aid readers in further exploring all aspects of the topic. In summary this survey takes stock of the current state and discusses remaining grand challenegs related to applying kernels on graphs to make learning possible with increasing amounts of structured and unstructured data expected over next decade.",1
"In recent years, developing a speech understanding system that classifies a waveform to structured data, such as intents and slots, without first transcribing the speech to text has emerged as an interesting research problem. This work proposes such as system with an additional constraint of designing a system that has a small enough footprint to run on small micro-controllers and embedded systems with minimal latency. Given a streaming input speech signal, the proposed system can process it segment-by-segment without the need to have the entire stream at the moment of processing. The proposed system is evaluated on the publicly available Fluent Speech Commands dataset. Experiments show that the proposed system yields state-of-the-art performance with the advantage of low latency and a much smaller model when compared to other published works on the same task.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to spoken language understanding that combines advances in natural language processing (NLP) with techniques from deep learning and computer vision. Our proposed system achieves state-of-the-art results without relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR), which can introduce significant latency and errors into the pipeline. Instead, we use pre-trained visual models to extract high-level representations directly from raw audio inputs. These features are then fed into a transformer network for contextualization and NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. We show that our method outperforms traditional ASR-based systems across multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining low latency. Overall, our work represents a major step forward towards realizing truly humanlike conversational agents that operate in real time.",1
"Optimal Transport is a theory that allows to define geometrical notions of distance between probability distributions and to find correspondences, relationships, between sets of points. Many machine learning applications are derived from this theory, at the frontier between mathematics and optimization. This thesis proposes to study the complex scenario in which the different data belong to incomparable spaces. In particular we address the following questions: how to define and apply Optimal Transport between graphs, between structured data? How can it be adapted when the data are varied and not embedded in the same metric space? This thesis proposes a set of Optimal Transport tools for these different cases. An important part is notably devoted to the study of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance whose properties allow to define interesting transport problems on incomparable spaces. More broadly, we analyze the mathematical properties of the various proposed tools, we establish algorithmic solutions to compute them and we study their applicability in numerous machine learning scenarii which cover, in particular, classification, simplification, partitioning of structured data, as well as heterogeneous domain adaptation.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, optimal transport theory has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematics and computer science, providing efficient algorithms for solving complex problems related to resource allocation, image processing, and machine learning. However, many real world applications involve incomparable spaces, where traditional methods fail due to the lack of a natural metric or measure. This paper contributes to the development of optimal transport on incomparable spaces by introducing new approaches based on partial orderings and set functions. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to solve difficult optimization problems in practice, such as planning routes through road networks that have no well-defined distance function. Our results generalize existing literature and offer promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"Modern machine learning applications should be able to address the intrinsic challenges arising over inference on massive real-world datasets, including scalability and robustness to outliers. Despite the multiple benefits of Bayesian methods (such as uncertainty-aware predictions, incorporation of experts knowledge, and hierarchical modeling), the quality of classic Bayesian inference depends critically on whether observations conform with the assumed data generating model, which is impossible to guarantee in practice. In this work, we propose a variational inference method that, in a principled way, can simultaneously scale to large datasets, and robustify the inferred posterior with respect to the existence of outliers in the observed data. Reformulating Bayes theorem via the $\beta$-divergence, we posit a robustified pseudo-Bayesian posterior as the target of inference. Moreover, relying on the recent formulations of Riemannian coresets for scalable Bayesian inference, we propose a sparse variational approximation of the robustified posterior and an efficient stochastic black-box algorithm to construct it. Overall our method allows releasing cleansed data summaries that can be applied broadly in scenarios including structured data corruption. We illustrate the applicability of our approach in diverse simulated and real datasets, and various statistical models, including Gaussian mean inference, logistic and neural linear regression, demonstrating its superiority to existing Bayesian summarization methods in the presence of outliers.",0
"""The ability to accurately summarize large datasets has become increasingly important in today's data-driven world. Traditional methods often struggle when dealing with outliers that can distort the overall picture of the underlying distribution. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called ""$\beta$-cores"" which robustly handles outliers while providing reliable and efficient summary statistics. Our approach combines the advantages of both hierarchical clustering and density estimation techniques, allowing us to effectively identify clusters even under noisy conditions. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets from various domains, demonstrating substantial improvement over state-of-the-art alternatives.""",1
"The ability to detect and count certain substructures in graphs is important for solving many tasks on graph-structured data, especially in the contexts of computational chemistry and biology as well as social network analysis. Inspired by this, we propose to study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) via their ability to count attributed graph substructures, extending recent works that examine their power in graph isomorphism testing and function approximation. We distinguish between two types of substructure counting: induced-subgraph-count and subgraph-count, and establish both positive and negative answers for popular GNN architectures. Specifically, we prove that Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), 2-Weisfeiler-Lehman (2-WL) and 2-Invariant Graph Networks (2-IGNs) cannot perform induced-subgraph-count of substructures consisting of 3 or more nodes, while they can perform subgraph-count of star-shaped substructures. As an intermediary step, we prove that 2-WL and 2-IGNs are equivalent in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs, partly answering an open problem raised in Maron et al. (2019). We also prove positive results for k-WL and k-IGNs as well as negative results for k-WL with a finite number of iterations. We then conduct experiments that support the theoretical results for MPNNs and 2-IGNs. Moreover, motivated by substructure counting and inspired by Murphy et al. (2019), we propose the Local Relational Pooling model and demonstrate that it is not only effective for substructure counting but also able to achieve competitive performance on molecular prediction tasks.",0

Our method outperforms traditional methods by utilizing the unique strengths of GNNs such as their ability to handle complex nonlinear relationships between entities within a dataset. In conclusion, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of GNNs in counting substructures and highlights the potential of this technology in enhancing computational efficiency across a variety of fields.",1
"We propose a flexible framework for clustering hypergraph-structured data based on recently proposed random walks utilizing edge-dependent vertex weights. When incorporating edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW), a weight is associated with each vertex-hyperedge pair, yielding a weighted incidence matrix of the hypergraph. Such weightings have been utilized in term-document representations of text data sets. We explain how random walks with EDVW serve to construct different hypergraph Laplacian matrices, and then develop a suite of clustering methods that use these incidence matrices and Laplacians for hypergraph clustering. Using several data sets from real-life applications, we compare the performance of these clustering algorithms experimentally against a variety of existing hypergraph clustering methods. We show that the proposed methods produce higher-quality clusters and conclude by highlighting avenues for future work.",0
"Title: Hypergraph Random Walks, Laplacians, and Clustering  Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to clustering problems using hypergraphs, random walks, and laplacians. In traditional graph theory, graphs represent relationships between objects as nodes connected by edges. However, many real-world applications require modeling interactions among groups of entities rather than just pairwise connections, which can be better represented using hypergraphs. We develop two methods for generating uniform random walks on hypergraphs and define different types of laplacians based on these random walks. Our main contribution lies in exploiting the properties of these laplacians for efficient clustering. To evaluate our methodology, we perform extensive experiments across several domains such as image processing, social network analysis, bioinformatics, and text mining. Results demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. By providing new tools to analyze complex systems with non-binary relations, our study paves the way for advancements in areas that heavily rely on understanding multi-relational data structures like web search engines, recommender systems, and fraud detection.",1
"The recent introduction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their growing popularity in the past few years has enabled the application of deep learning algorithms to non-Euclidean, graph-structured data. GNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results across an impressive array of graph-based machine learning problems. Nevertheless, despite their rapid pace of development, much of the work on GNNs has focused on graph classification and embedding techniques, largely ignoring regression tasks over graph data. In this paper, we develop a Graph Mixture Density Network (GraphMDN), which combines graph neural networks with mixture density network (MDN) outputs. By combining these techniques, GraphMDNs have the advantage of naturally being able to incorporate graph structured information into a neural architecture, as well as the ability to model multi-modal regression targets. As such, GraphMDNs are designed to excel on regression tasks wherein the data are graph structured, and target statistics are better represented by mixtures of densities rather than singular values (so-called ``inverse problems""). To demonstrate this, we extend an existing GNN architecture known as Semantic GCN (SemGCN) to a GraphMDN structure, and show results from the Human3.6M pose estimation task. The extended model consistently outperforms both GCN and MDN architectures on their own, with a comparable number of parameters.",0
"GraphMDN: A novel approach that utilizes graph theory and deep neural networks to tackle challenging inverse problems GraphMDN combines principles from two powerful fields – graph theory and deep learning – to address difficult inverse problems encountered in computer vision, signal processing, and other domains where the output data is corrupted by noise or missing information. Inspired by traditional methods based on regularization theory, our method leverages graphs and graph Laplacians to encode structural priors into the optimization process. By embedding these prior knowledge into a flexible framework compatible with modern deep architectures, we can learn complex mappings without assuming any specific structure like sparsity, smoothness, or low rank constraints commonly used in existing techniques. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models across a variety of benchmark datasets, demonstrating remarkable robustness against varying degrees of noise contamination, degraded input quality, and limited training samples. These findings showcase the advantages of incorporating graph structured information into deep architectures, promising new perspectives for researchers working in data recovery, image denoising, and many others areas requiring effective inference algorithms. Keywords: inverse problem, graph, Laplacian matrix, regularization, deep neural network, signal processing, computer vision Inverse problems arise frequently in numerous applications such as computer vision, signal processing, and medical imaging [1].

"Graph Neural Networks achieve remarkable results on problems with structured data but come as black-box predictors. Transferring existing explanation techniques, such as occlusion, fails as even removing a single node or edge can lead to drastic changes in the graph. The resulting graphs can differ from all training examples, causing model confusion and wrong explanations. Thus, we argue that explicability must use graphs compliant with the distribution underlying the training data. We coin this property Distribution Compliant Explanation (DCE) and present a novel Contrastive GNN Explanation (CoGE) technique following this paradigm. An experimental study supports the efficacy of CoGE.",0

"Graph, as an important data representation, is ubiquitous in many real world applications ranging from social network analysis to biology. How to correctly and effectively learn and extract information from graph is essential for a large number of machine learning tasks. Graph embedding is a way to transform and encode the data structure in high dimensional and non-Euclidean feature space to a low dimensional and structural space, which is easily exploited by other machine learning algorithms. We have witnessed a huge surge of such embedding methods, from statistical approaches to recent deep learning methods such as the graph convolutional networks (GCN). Deep learning approaches usually outperform the traditional methods in most graph learning benchmarks by building an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the loss function directly. However, most of the existing GCN methods can only perform convolution operations with node features, while ignoring the handy information in edge features, such as relations in knowledge graphs. To address this problem, we present CensNet, Convolution with Edge-Node Switching graph neural network, for learning tasks in graph-structured data with both node and edge features. CensNet is a general graph embedding framework, which embeds both nodes and edges to a latent feature space. By using line graph of the original undirected graph, the role of nodes and edges are switched, and two novel graph convolution operations are proposed for feature propagation. Experimental results on real-world academic citation networks and quantum chemistry graphs show that our approach achieves or matches the state-of-the-art performance in four graph learning tasks, including semi-supervised node classification, multi-task graph classification, graph regression, and link prediction.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporates both nodes and edges as input features using co-embeddings. Traditional GNN methods primarily use graphs composed of node attributes and edge features, but these approaches often neglect the importance of capturing both types of relationships within a single model. In contrast, our method uses jointly embedded representations of nodes and edges, allowing the network to learn more expressive latent embeddings and improve performance on tasks such as node classification and link prediction. We evaluate our proposed method across several benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved results compared to state-of-the-art GNN models. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of integrating both node and edge information into GNN architectures.",1
"Representation learning of graph-structured data is challenging because both graph structure and node features carry important information. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide an expressive way to fuse information from network structure and node features. However, GNNs are prone to adversarial attacks. Here we introduce Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB), an information-theoretic principle that optimally balances expressiveness and robustness of the learned representation of graph-structured data. Inheriting from the general Information Bottleneck (IB), GIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between the representation and the target, and simultaneously constraining the mutual information between the representation and the input data. Different from the general IB, GIB regularizes the structural as well as the feature information. We design two sampling algorithms for structural regularization and instantiate the GIB principle with two new models: GIB-Cat and GIB-Bern, and demonstrate the benefits by evaluating the resilience to adversarial attacks. We show that our proposed models are more robust than state-of-the-art graph defense models. GIB-based models empirically achieve up to 31% improvement with adversarial perturbation of the graph structure as well as node features.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to analyze the graph-structured data in various application domains, e.g., social networks, molecular biology, and anomaly detection. With great power, the GNN models, usually as valuable Intellectual Properties of their owners, also become attractive targets of the attacker. Recent studies show that machine learning models are facing a severe threat called Model Extraction Attacks, where a well-trained private model owned by a service provider can be stolen by the attacker pretending as a client. Unfortunately, existing works focus on the models trained on the Euclidean space, e.g., images and texts, while how to extract a GNN model that contains a graph structure and node features is yet to be explored. In this paper, we explore and develop model extraction attacks against GNN models. Given only black-box access to a target GNN model, the attacker aims to reconstruct a duplicated one via several nodes he obtained (called attacker nodes). We first systematically formalise the threat modeling in the context of GNN model extraction and classify the adversarial threats into seven categories by considering different background knowledge of the attacker, e.g., attributes and/or neighbor connectives of the attacker nodes. Then we present the detailed methods which utilize the accessible knowledge in each threat to implement the attacks. By evaluating over three real-world datasets, our attacks are shown to extract duplicated models effectively, i.e., more than 89% inputs in the target domain have the same output predictions as the victim model.",0
"Advances in deep learning have led to significant progress across many fields from computer vision to natural language processing. One crucial component of such advances has been graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs provide powerful techniques that enable understanding of complex non-Euclidean domains where nodes carry out multiple types of data, edges connecting nodes represent different relationships among them, and each node may have an associated feature vector whose size depends on the complexity of the domain. Thereby, they capture essential properties intrinsic to these data structures while allowing the user to focus solely on model development without worrying about the underlying structure or type of input data. Unfortunately, their success motivates attackers to reverse engineer trained models so as to replicate their accuracy. Such efforts aim at stealing valuable intellectual property behind machine learning products either by copying or adapting their architecture to new tasks. Therefore there is a pressing need to examine the problem more closely and gain insights into ways for mitigating the threat of extraction attacks on GNN architectures. This work presents a taxonomy of existing works based on different dimensions that distinguish between approaches followed by adversaries. We demonstrate both white box and black box scenarios which lead us to discuss three broad categories of realisations. Finally we describe possible defensive strategies and outline future research directions towards mitigating the threat of extracting such models.",1
"Graph embeddings are a ubiquitous tool for machine learning tasks, such as node classification and link prediction, on graph-structured data. However, computing the embeddings for large-scale graphs is prohibitively inefficient even if we are interested only in a small subset of relevant vertices. To address this, we present an efficient graph coarsening approach, based on Schur complements, for computing the embedding of the relevant vertices. We prove that these embeddings are preserved exactly by the Schur complement graph that is obtained via Gaussian elimination on the non-relevant vertices. As computing Schur complements is expensive, we give a nearly-linear time algorithm that generates a coarsened graph on the relevant vertices that provably matches the Schur complement in expectation in each iteration. Our experiments involving prediction tasks on graphs demonstrate that computing embeddings on the coarsened graph, rather than the entire graph, leads to significant time savings without sacrificing accuracy.",0

Our characterization shows that the benchmark suite is diverse in data size, distribution, feature distribution and learning task complexity. We have developed reference implementations, and evaluated the important aspects of federated learning, including model accuracy, communication cost, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation and vertical federated learning.",0
"Federated learning is growing rapidly, but there remains little consensus on evaluation benchmarks that capture important aspects of this technology’s performance—especially given federated systems typically involve tradeoffs across multiple dimensions including accuracy, resource utilization, scalability, and privacy-related metrics (such as quantifiable levels of leakage). This paper addresses these challenging tradeoffs by introducing the Open Academic Research Federation (OARF) benchmark suite, which encompasses several datasets spanning different domains (finance, sentiment analysis, biological science), model architectures (including both deep neural networks and random forests), batch sizes, communication budgets, data heterogeneity settings, and other relevant factors such as serverless computing platforms. We conduct extensive experiments using real users providing their own local models to train, exploring how combinations of these dataset/architectural features impact global test accuracy, wall-clock training time, required server resources, and actual levels of user engagement and task completion rates. Using a set of interactive dashboards available online, we aim to encourage further research into characterizing the tradeoffs involved in deploying federated systems at scale while facilitating conversations between stakeholders seeking guidance on setting up their own OARF instances and contributing to our shared knowledge base on best practices in evaluating these complex distributed machine learning pipelines. Key findings include identifying key scalability thresholds beyond which system administrators may struggle to efficiently manage infrastructure demands; illuminating intricate dependencies among dataset characteristics and various forms of privacy leakage inherent within popular aggregation schemes; underscoring the importance o",1
"Graph neural network models have been extensively used to learn node representations for graph structured data in an end-to-end setting. These models often rely on localized first order approximations of spectral graph convolutions and hence are unable to capture higher-order relational information between nodes. Probabilistic Graphical Models form another class of models that provide rich flexibility in incorporating such relational information but are limited by inefficient approximate inference algorithms at higher order. In this paper, we propose to combine these approaches to learn better node and graph representations. First, we derive an efficient approximate sum-product loopy belief propagation inference algorithm for higher-order PGMs. We then embed the message passing updates into a neural network to provide the inductive bias of the inference algorithm in end-to-end learning. This gives us a model that is flexible enough to accommodate domain knowledge while maintaining the computational advantage. We further propose methods for constructing higher-order factors that are conditioned on node and edge features and share parameters wherever necessary. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model indeed captures higher-order information, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art $k$-order graph neural networks in molecular datasets.",0
"This paper presents a new method for efficiently propagating higher-order beliefs in neural networks. We show that by using a modified version of traditional belief propagation algorithms, we can achieve significantly faster convergence times while maintaining accurate results. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep learning to create a more powerful and flexible inference engine, allowing us to capture complex relationships between variables and distill large amounts of data into compact representations. In addition, we introduce several novel techniques to improve robustness and reduce the risk of overfitting. Through experimental evaluation on a range of challenging tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in enabling efficient probabilistic inference at scale.",1
"Fairness in machine learning is crucial when individuals are subject to automated decisions made by models in high-stake domains. Organizations that employ these models may also need to satisfy regulations that promote responsible and ethical A.I. While fairness metrics relying on comparing model error rates across subpopulations have been widely investigated for the detection and mitigation of bias, fairness in terms of the equalized ability to achieve recourse for different protected attribute groups has been relatively unexplored. We present a novel formulation for training neural networks that considers the distance of data points to the decision boundary such that the new objective: (1) reduces the average distance to the decision boundary between two groups for individuals subject to a negative outcome in each group, i.e. the network is more fair with respect to the ability to obtain recourse, and (2) increases the average distance of data points to the boundary to promote adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that training with this loss yields more fair and robust neural networks with similar accuracies to models trained without it. Moreover, we qualitatively motivate and empirically show that reducing recourse disparity across groups also improves fairness measures that rely on error rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that recourse capabilities across groups are considered to train fairer neural networks, and a relation between error rates based fairness and recourse based fairness is investigated.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress towards solving complex real-world problems by utilizing large amounts of data and computational resources. One such domain that has benefited from these advancements is structured data prediction, where neural networks predict structured outputs based on input data. Despite their successes, deep neural networks have been criticized for overfitting and lacking robustness under distributional shift, which can result in degraded performance or even failures in applications that rely on them. In response to these concerns, we present a novel approach called FaiR-N, short for Fair and Robust Neural Networks for Structured Data. Our method is designed to address both overfitting and sensitivity to distribution shifts by utilizing fairness constraints derived from statistical metrics and adversarial training techniques to regularize model weights and increase generalization ability. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse benchmark datasets, further validating our contributions towards producing more reliable and trustworthy models. Overall, this work represents an important step towards developing high-quality, ethical AI systems capable of meeting user expectations while ensuring greater fairness and accountability.",1
"Exploiting the rapid advances in probabilistic inference, in particular variational Bayes and variational autoencoders (VAEs), for anomaly detection (AD) tasks remains an open research question. Previous works argued that training VAE models only with inliers is insufficient and the framework should be significantly modified in order to discriminate the anomalous instances. In this work, we exploit the deep conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and we define an original loss function together with a metric that targets hierarchically structured data AD. Our motivating application is a real world problem: monitoring the trigger system which is a basic component of many particle physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the experiments we show the superior performance of this method for classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks and for our application.",0
"This article proposes a novel method called conditional variational autoencoder anomaly detection (CVAAD) that detects outliers using the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders (VAEs). Previous works often employ VAEs to learn representations as latent variables and then measure the anomaly score based on how far away these latent vectors are from the training data distribution. However, previous methods ignore the information on the input space which leads to suboptimal results. In contrast, CVAAD employs two encoders: one maps inputs into latent representations while another maps raw pixel values into compressed representation in latent space conditioned on original input features. By leveraging both high-level semantic features extracted by decoder and low-level details preserved by reconstructor, we can effectively capture complex structures and patterns of normal distributions. Our experiments show improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines under several evaluation metrics across multiple datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",1
"Recently, graph neural networks have attracted great attention and achieved prominent performance in various research fields. Most of those algorithms have assumed pairwise relationships of objects of interest. However, in many real applications, the relationships between objects are in higher-order, beyond a pairwise formulation. To efficiently learn deep embeddings on the high-order graph-structured data, we introduce two end-to-end trainable operators to the family of graph neural networks, i.e., hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention. Whilst hypergraph convolution defines the basic formulation of performing convolution on a hypergraph, hypergraph attention further enhances the capacity of representation learning by leveraging an attention module. With the two operators, a graph neural network is readily extended to a more flexible model and applied to diverse applications where non-pairwise relationships are observed. Extensive experimental results with semi-supervised node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention.",0
"In recent years, hypergraphs have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex relationships among entities in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and knowledge graphs. Unlike traditional graph convolutional networks (GCN), which represent each node as a single entity and their connectivity as edges, hypergraphs can capture richer structures by representing nodes as sets and edges as relations between them. These structures make hypergraphs well suited for capturing dependencies and interactions among multiple entities within different modalities, enabling state-of-the-art performance on tasks that involve understanding these interdependencies. However, designing effective algorithms for learning representations from hypergraph data remains challenging due to the intrinsic complexity introduced by higher-order relationships. This paper presents two novel frameworks: hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention mechanisms, capable of accurately extracting features from heterogeneous hypergraphs. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over GCN methods across diverse applications. Furthermore, we showcase how our models achieve competitive results with fewer parameters while generalizing better out-of-sample. Overall, the presented work provides foundational research towards developing more efficient deep learning architectures, particularly when dealing with intricate multimodal hypergraphs. While future investigations must examine other aspects of model development, validation, and deployment, our contributions constitute important steps forward in addressing real-world problems characterized by high-dimensionality, noise, uncertainty, imbalance, skewness, nonlinearity, and sparsity.",1
"Graphs are the most ubiquitous form of structured data representation used in machine learning. They model, however, only pairwise relations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order relations found in many real-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges. Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information. Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach, inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation, we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on representative benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the higher expressive power of HyperSAGE makes it more stable in learning node representations as compared to the alternatives.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently benefited from advancements in deep learning methods applied to graph-structured data. However, real-world problems often involve complex relationships that cannot be captured by mere graphs. In our work we tackle this issue by extending recent state-of-the-art techniques for inductive representation learning on hypergraphs - structures consisting of entities and their interactions encoded as edges connected among k vertices each representing a different aspect of the interaction called dimensions. We introduce a novel framework named HyperSAGE for generalization and efficient computation of similarities between objects described via hyperedges over latent feature spaces. To showcase its effectiveness, we present experimental evidence for link prediction tasks demonstrating outperformance against several competing approaches across both synthetic benchmark datasets and two large real world knowledge bases YAGO2 and DBLP. Notably, we attain results on DBLP superior to previously published ones using other machine learning models. Additionally, we evaluate HyperSAGE in the context of semi-supervised learning achieving improvements comparable to those obtained by baseline supervised training alone. Our findings have implications on the scalability and expressivity of AI models designed for real world applications built upon structured representations.

"Graph neural networks have become an important tool for modeling structured data. In many real-world systems, intricate hidden information may exist, e.g., heterogeneity in nodes/edges, static node/edge attributes, and spatiotemporal node/edge features. However, most existing methods only take part of the information into consideration. In this paper, we present the Co-evolved Meta Graph Neural Network (CoMGNN), which applies meta graph attention to heterogeneous graphs with co-evolution of node and edge states. We further propose a spatiotemporal adaption of CoMGNN (ST-CoMGNN) for modeling spatiotemporal patterns on nodes and edges. We conduct experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of encoding diverse information from different aspects.",0
"This paper presents a new method for processing heterogeneous graphs using meta graph attention (MGA). MGA allows nodes in the graph to receive different amounts of attention from one another based on their importance, which can improve the accuracy of downstream applications such as node classification and graph generation. The proposed method extends previous work by incorporating both node and edge evolution into the computation process. Edge evolution captures how the connections between nodes change over time, while node evolution accounts for changes in individual nodes within the same graph. By combining these two types of evolution, we can more accurately model dynamic relationships within the graph. In addition to enhanced evolution modeling, our approach uses MGA at each level of a hierarchical decomposition of the original graph. This hierarchy promotes efficient calculation and scalability as the number of edges grows very large. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods across multiple domains, including social network analysis, molecular biology, and web page analysis. Our framework enables flexible integration of task-specific features and models, allowing practitioners to benefit from graph attentions without sacrificing customization needs. Overall, the contributions of this research lead to improved performance and increased usability for graph attention computations.",1
"Understanding customer behavior is fundamental for many use-cases in industry, especially in accelerated growth areas such as fin-tech and e-commerce. Structured data are often expensive, time-consuming and inadequate to analyze and study complex customer behaviors. In this paper, we propose a multi-graph embedding approach for creating a non-linear representation of customers in order to have a better knowledge of their characteristics without having any prior information about their financial status or their interests. By applying the current method we are able to predict users' future behavior with a reasonably high accuracy only by having the information of their friendship network. Potential applications include recommendation systems and credit risk forecasting.",0

We validate our method on real-world data from a large e-commerce platform and show significant improvements over existing approaches in predicting key user actions and purchase outcomes. Our results demonstrate that friendship connections play a critical role in shaping customer behavior, highlighting the importance of social factors in understanding consumer decisions.""",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have risen to prominence in learning representations for graph structured data. A single GNN layer typically consists of a feature transformation and a feature aggregation operation. The former normally uses feed-forward networks to transform features, while the latter aggregates the transformed features over the graph. Numerous recent works have proposed GNN models with different designs in the aggregation operation. In this work, we establish mathematically that the aggregation processes in a group of representative GNN models including GCN, GAT, PPNP, and APPNP can be regarded as (approximately) solving a graph denoising problem with a smoothness assumption. Such a unified view across GNNs not only provides a new perspective to understand a variety of aggregation operations but also enables us to develop a unified graph neural network framework UGNN. To demonstrate its promising potential, we instantiate a novel GNN model, ADA-UGNN, derived from UGNN, to handle graphs with adaptive smoothness across nodes. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of ADA-UGNN.",0
"Graph neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for processing graph data. They can learn useful representations from graphs by propagating signals along their edges.

We first discuss the core components of graph signal denoising techniques based on graph neural networks, including data preprocessing, noise modeling, optimization formulations, and architecture design. Then we survey several representative methods that fall under this umbrella term, exploring their strengths and weaknesses, open questions, and connections to related work in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains. Finally, we suggest promising areas for further investigation, such as incorporating domain knowledge into graph neural networks, developing new architectures tailored for specific problem classes, and analyzing their theoretical properties in depth. By taking a broad perspective on graph neural network-based graph signal denoising, we hope to encourage collaboration among researchers working in different communities and foster deeper understanding of how these methods operate and can be improved.",1
"The Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge based on the well-known Imagenet dataset catalyzed an intense flurry of progress in computer vision. Benchmark tasks have propelled other sub-fields of machine learning forward at an equally impressive pace, but in healthcare it has primarily been image processing tasks, such as in dermatology and radiology, that have experienced similar benchmark-driven progress. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive review of benchmarks in medical machine learning for structured data, identifying one based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) that allows the first direct comparison of predictive performance and thus the evaluation of progress on four clinical prediction tasks: mortality, length of stay, phenotyping, and patient decompensation. We find that little meaningful progress has been made over a 3 year period on these tasks, despite significant community engagement. Through our meta-analysis, we find that the performance of deep recurrent models is only superior to logistic regression on certain tasks. We conclude with a synthesis of these results, possible explanations, and a list of desirable qualities for future benchmarks in medical machine learning.",0
"This paper presents an evaluation of recent advances in machine learning applied to longitudinal electronic healthcare data (EHD). With the increasing availability of large amounts of EHD generated by modern medical technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs), there has been significant interest in using machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights from these datasets. In particular, applying machine learning to longitudinal EHD allows researchers to model changes over time, which can provide new opportunities for understanding patient outcomes and improving care. We reviewed current literature on machine learning applications for longitudinal EHD and identified key challenges facing the field. Our findings suggest that while substantial progress has been made, there remain many open issues related to data quality, algorithm performance, and interpretability of results. To address these challenges, we propose several areas of future work including developing more advanced methods for handling missing data, exploring techniques for interpreting complex models, and identifying strategies for integrating multiple sources of evidence into decision making. Overall, our evaluation highlights both the promise and the complexity of machine learning for longitudinal EHD analysis, suggesting that further investigation is warranted.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a generalization of neural networks to graph-structured data, are often implemented using message passes between entities of a graph. While GNNs are effective for node classification, link prediction and graph classification, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., a small perturbation to the structure can lead to a non-trivial performance degradation. In this work, we propose Uncertainty Matching GNN (UM-GNN), that is aimed at improving the robustness of GNN models, particularly against poisoning attacks to the graph structure, by leveraging epistemic uncertainties from the message passing framework. More specifically, we propose to build a surrogate predictor that does not directly access the graph structure, but systematically extracts reliable knowledge from a standard GNN through a novel uncertainty-matching strategy. Interestingly, this uncoupling makes UM-GNN immune to evasion attacks by design, and achieves significantly improved robustness against poisoning attacks. Using empirical studies with standard benchmarks and a suite of global and target attacks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of UM-GNN, when compared to existing baselines including the state-of-the-art robust GCN.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to defend against poisoning attacks on graph neural networks (GNNs), which are commonly used in applications such as node classification and link prediction. Poisoning attacks are a serious threat to GNNs, where adversaries manipulate training data to reduce model accuracy or cause misclassification. Our method addresses this problem by introducing uncertainty-matching graph neural networks (UM-GNNs). UM-GNNs use Bayesian inference to estimate uncertainty in edge weights during both training and testing, allowing them to identify and discard potentially poisoned edges. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods across several benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that UM-GNNs can effectively detect poisoning attacks even when using only a small fraction of labeled data. Overall, our work shows that incorporating uncertainty into GNNs is a promising direction for improving their robustness to adversarial attacks.",1
"Graph structured data has wide applicability in various domains such as physics, chemistry, biology, computer vision, and social networks, to name a few. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in effectively representing graph structured data because of their good performance and generalization ability. GNN is a deep learning based method that learns a node representation by combining specific nodes and the structural/topological information of a graph. However, like other deep models, explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in comparison to the existing explanation methods.",0
"Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as powerful models for representation learning on graph data, such as knowledge graphs and social networks.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable attention and have emerged as a new promising paradigm to process graph-structured data. GNNs are usually stacked to multiple layers and the node representations in each layer are computed through propagating and aggregating the neighboring node features with respect to the graph. By stacking to multiple layers, GNNs are able to capture the long-range dependencies among the data on the graph and thus bring performance improvements. To train a GNN with multiple layers effectively, some normalization techniques (e.g., node-wise normalization, batch-wise normalization) are necessary. However, the normalization techniques for GNNs are highly task-relevant and different application tasks prefer to different normalization techniques, which is hard to know in advance. To tackle this deficiency, in this paper, we propose to learn graph normalization by optimizing a weighted combination of normalization techniques at four different levels, including node-wise normalization, adjacency-wise normalization, graph-wise normalization, and batch-wise normalization, in which the adjacency-wise normalization and the graph-wise normalization are newly proposed in this paper to take into account the local structure and the global structure on the graph, respectively. By learning the optimal weights, we are able to automatically select a single best or a best combination of multiple normalizations for a specific task. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for different tasks, including node classification, link prediction, graph classification and graph regression, and confirm that the learned graph normalization leads to competitive results and that the learned weights suggest the appropriate normalization techniques for the specific task. Source code is released here https://github.com/cyh1112/GraphNormalization.",0
"Effectively normalizing large scale graphs has been a challenge due to the high computational requirements of traditional normalization methods such as batch renormalization and layerwise normalization. These methods can lead to significant memory usage and slow down training time on very deep neural networks. In this study we propose graph normalization as a solution to this problem, which utilizes Chebyshev approximations to speed up computations without sacrificing accuracy. This approach allows us to efficiently normalize extremely large datasets while reducing memory usage during training. Our experimental results show that our proposed method leads to improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.",1
"While existing predictive frameworks are able to handle Euclidean structured data (i.e, brain images), they might fail to generalize to geometric non-Euclidean data such as brain networks. Besides, these are rooted the sample selection step in using Euclidean or learned similarity measure between vectorized training and testing brain networks. Such sample connectomic representation might include irrelevant and redundant features that could mislead the training sample selection step. Undoubtedly, this fails to exploit and preserve the topology of the brain connectome. To overcome this major drawback, we propose Residual Embedding Similarity-Based Network selection (RESNets) for predicting brain network evolution trajectory from a single timepoint. RESNets first learns a compact geometric embedding of each training and testing sample using adversarial connectome embedding network. This nicely reduces the high-dimensionality of brain networks while preserving their topological properties via graph convolutional networks. Next, to compute the similarity between subjects, we introduce the concept of a connectional brain template (CBT), a fixed network reference, where we further represent each training and testing network as a deviation from the reference CBT in the embedding space. As such, we select the most similar training subjects to the testing subject at baseline by comparing their learned residual embeddings with respect to the pre-defined CBT. Once the best training samples are selected at baseline, we simply average their corresponding brain networks at follow-up timepoints to predict the evolution trajectory of the testing network. Our experiments on both healthy and disordered brain networks demonstrate the success of our proposed method in comparison to RESNets ablated versions and traditional approaches.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved high performance in analyzing graph-structured data and have been widely deployed in safety-critical areas, such as finance and autonomous driving. However, only a few works have explored GNNs' robustness to adversarial attacks, and their designs are usually limited by the scale of input datasets (i.e., focusing on small graphs with only thousands of nodes). In this work, we propose, SAG, the first scalable adversarial attack method with Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We first decouple the large-scale graph into several smaller graph partitions and cast the original problem into several subproblems. Then, we propose to solve these subproblems using projected gradient descent on both the graph topology and the node features that lead to considerably lower memory consumption compared to the conventional attack methods. Rigorous experiments further demonstrate that SAG can significantly reduce the computation and memory overhead compared with the state-of-the-art approach, making SAG applicable towards graphs with large size of nodes and edges.",0

"Despite substantial progress in signal source separation, results for richly structured data continue to contain perceptible artifacts. In contrast, recent deep generative models can produce authentic samples in a variety of domains that are indistinguishable from samples of the data distribution. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to source separation that uses generative models as priors over the components of a mixture of sources, and noise-annealed Langevin dynamics to sample from the posterior distribution of sources given a mixture. This decouples the source separation problem from generative modeling, enabling us to directly use cutting-edge generative models as priors.

DGPs encourage NMF to generate physically plausible solutions that match prior distributions learned by generative models on large datasets. We evaluate the performance of our approach on real-world mixtures and show that it produces state-of-the-art results while remaining computationally efficient compared to other methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate how DGPs can improve the interpretability of the separated sources by analyzing their spectral characteristics and showing that they align well with human expectations.

"Axis-aligned decision forests have long been the leading class of machine learning algorithms for modeling tabular data. In many applications of machine learning such as learning-to-rank, decision forests deliver remarkable performance. They also possess other coveted characteristics such as interpretability. Despite their widespread use and rich history, decision forests to date fail to consume raw structured data such as text, or learn effective representations for them, a factor behind the success of deep neural networks in recent years. While there exist methods that construct smoothed decision forests to achieve representation learning, the resulting models are decision forests in name only: They are no longer axis-aligned, use stochastic decisions, or are not interpretable. Furthermore, none of the existing methods are appropriate for problems that require a Transfer Learning treatment. In this work, we present a novel but intuitive proposal to achieve representation learning for decision forests without imposing new restrictions or necessitating structural changes. Our model is simply a decision forest, possibly trained using any forest learning algorithm, atop a deep neural network. By approximating the gradients of the decision forest through input perturbation, a purely analytical procedure, the decision forest directs the neural network to learn or fine-tune representations. Our framework has the advantage that it is applicable to any arbitrary decision forest and that it allows the use of arbitrary deep neural networks for representation learning. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposal through experiments on synthetic and benchmark classification datasets.",0

"Urban ride-hailing demand prediction is a crucial but challenging task for intelligent transportation system construction. Predictable ride-hailing demand can facilitate more reasonable vehicle scheduling and online car-hailing platform dispatch. Conventional deep learning methods with no external structured data can be accomplished via hybrid models of CNNs and RNNs by meshing plentiful pixel-level labeled data, but spatial data sparsity and limited learning capabilities on temporal long-term dependencies are still two striking bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we propose a new virtual graph modeling method to focus on significant demand regions and a novel Deep Multi-View Spatiotemporal Virtual Graph Neural Network (DMVST-VGNN) to strengthen learning capabilities of spatial dynamics and temporal long-term dependencies. Specifically, DMVST-VGNN integrates the structures of 1D Convolutional Neural Network, Multi Graph Attention Neural Network and Transformer layer, which correspond to short-term temporal dynamics view, spatial dynamics view and long-term temporal dynamics view respectively.

We train our model on these multi-view spatiotemporal virtual graphs which capture both the structure of urban areas and the dynamic behavior patterns of people and vehicles over time. Using large amounts of historical data, we demonstrate high accuracy in forecasting significant changes in ride-hailing demand over short periods ranging from several hours to one day ahead.

However, previous methods mainly focus on static graphs while many real-world graphs evolve over time. Modeling such evolution is important for predicting properties of unseen networks. To resolve this challenge, we propose SGRNN, a novel neural architecture that applies stochastic latent variables to simultaneously capture the evolution in node attributes and topology. Specifically, deterministic states are separated from stochastic states in the iterative process to suppress mutual interference. With semi-implicit variational inference integrated to SGRNN, a non-Gaussian variational distribution is proposed to help further improve the performance. In addition, to alleviate KL-vanishing problem in SGRNN, a simple and interpretable structure is proposed based on the lower bound of KL-divergence. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Code is available at https://github.com/StochasticGRNN/SGRNN.",0

"Recently, the surge in popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), mobile devices, social media, etc. has opened up a large source for graph data. Graph embedding has been proved extremely useful to learn low-dimensional feature representations from graph structured data. These feature representations can be used for a variety of prediction tasks from node classification to link prediction. However, existing graph embedding methods do not consider users' privacy to prevent inference attacks. That is, adversaries can infer users' sensitive information by analyzing node representations learned from graph embedding algorithms. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Privacy Graph Embedding (APGE), a graph adversarial training framework that integrates the disentangling and purging mechanisms to remove users' private information from learned node representations. The proposed method preserves the structural information and utility attributes of a graph while concealing users' private attributes from inference attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate the superior performance of APGE compared to the state-of-the-arts. Our source code can be found at https://github.com/uJ62JHD/Privacy-Preserving-Social-Network-Embedding.",0

"Operator-Valued Kernels (OVKs) and associated vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces provide an elegant way to extend scalar kernel methods when the output space is a Hilbert space. Although primarily used in finite dimension for problems like multi-task regression, the ability of this framework to deal with infinite dimensional output spaces unlocks many more applications, such as functional regression, structured output prediction, and structured data representation. However, these sophisticated schemes crucially rely on the kernel trick in the output space, so that most of previous works have focused on the square norm loss function, completely neglecting robustness issues that may arise in such surrogate problems. To overcome this limitation, this paper develops a duality approach that allows to solve OVK machines for a wide range of loss functions. The infinite dimensional Lagrange multipliers are handled through a Double Representer Theorem, and algorithms for $\epsilon$-insensitive losses and the Huber loss are thoroughly detailed. Robustness benefits are emphasized by a theoretical stability analysis, as well as empirical improvements on structured data applications.",0

Through our theoretical development and numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight its potential impact on various fields.",1
"As machine learning for images becomes democratized in the Software 2.0 era, one of the serious bottlenecks is securing enough labeled data for training. This problem is especially critical in a manufacturing setting where smart factories rely on machine learning for product quality control by analyzing industrial images. Such images are typically large and may only need to be partially analyzed where only a small portion is problematic (e.g., identifying defects on a surface). Since manual labeling these images is expensive, weak supervision is an attractive alternative where the idea is to generate weak labels that are not perfect, but can be produced at scale. Data programming is a recent paradigm in this category where it uses human knowledge in the form of labeling functions and combines them into a generative model. Data programming has been successful in applications based on text or structured data and can also be applied to images usually if one can find a way to convert them into structured data. In this work, we expand the horizon of data programming by directly applying it to images without this conversion, which is a common scenario for industrial applications. We propose Inspector Gadget, an image labeling system that combines crowdsourcing, data augmentation, and data programming to produce weak labels at scale for image classification. We perform experiments on real industrial image datasets and show that Inspector Gadget obtains better performance than other weak-labeling techniques: Snuba, GOGGLES, and self-learning baselines using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without pre-training.",0
"Automatic labeling of images can prove incredibly beneficial for many industrial applications such as quality control, defect detection, and decision making processes.

"In this paper, we focus on learning low-dimensional embeddings for nodes in graph-structured data. To achieve this, we propose Caps2NE -- a new unsupervised embedding model leveraging a network of two capsule layers. Caps2NE induces a routing process to aggregate feature vectors of context neighbors of a given target node at the first capsule layer, then feed these features into the second capsule layer to infer a plausible embedding for the target node. Experimental results show that our proposed Caps2NE obtains state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets for the node classification task.

A PointNet describes the local geometry which we embed into a sparse permutohedral lattice. The lattice allows for fast convolutions while keeping a low memory footprint. Further, we introduce DeformSlice, a novel learned data-dependent interpolation for projecting lattice features back onto the point cloud.

"Deep generative models have made tremendous advances in image and signal representation learning and generation. These models employ the full Euclidean space or a bounded subset as the latent space, whose flat geometry, however, is often too simplistic to meaningfully reflect the manifold structure of the data. In this work, we advocate the use of a multi-chart latent space for better data representation. Inspired by differential geometry, we propose a \textbf{Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE)} and prove a universal approximation theorem on its representation capability. We show that the training data size and the network size scale exponentially in approximation error with an exponent depending on the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold. CAE admits desirable manifold properties that auto-encoders with a flat latent space fail to obey, predominantly proximity of data. We conduct extensive experimentation with synthetic and real-life examples to demonstrate that CAE provides reconstruction with high fidelity, preserves proximity in the latent space, and generates new data remaining near the manifold. These experiments show that CAE is advantageous over existing auto-encoders and variants by preserving the topology of the data manifold as well as its geometry.",0

We show that any incidence tensor decomposes into invariant subsets. This decomposition, in turn, leads to a decomposition of the corresponding equivariant linear maps, for which we prove an efficient pooling-and-broadcasting implementation.",0
"Deep learning has seen tremendous success in recent years across diverse fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, robotics, bioinformatics, among others.

To address this limitation, we propose incidence networks: neural network architectures designed specifically for processing point cloud data represented using oriented incidences rather than traditional grids. Our key contributions include developing novel building blocks for constructing these architectures, introducing methods for training them efficiently without sacrificing expressivity, and demonstrating their effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets.

"Variational autoencoder (VAE) is a widely used generative model for learning latent representations. Burda et al. in their seminal paper showed that learning capacity of VAE is limited by over-pruning. It is a phenomenon where a significant number of latent variables fail to capture any information about the input data and the corresponding hidden units become inactive. This adversely affects learning diverse and interpretable latent representations. As variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) extends VAE for graph-structured data, it inherits the over-pruning problem. In this paper, we adopt a model based approach and propose epitomic VGAE (EVGAE),a generative variational framework for graph datasets which successfully mitigates the over-pruning problem and also boosts the generative ability of VGAE. We consider EVGAE to consist of multiple sparse VGAE models, called epitomes, that are groups of latent variables sharing the latent space. This approach aids in increasing active units as epitomes compete to learn better representation of the graph data. We verify our claims via experiments on three benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that EVGAE has a better generative ability than VGAE. Moreover, EVGAE outperforms VGAE on link prediction task in citation networks.",0
"Title: Variational Graph Autoencoders for Generative Modeling of Complex Data  Abstract:  Generative models have been gaining increasing popularity due to their ability to generate synthetic data that closely resembles real observations. Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in generative modeling through techniques such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, these methods often struggle with modeling complex data structures like graphs and networks due to their inherent irregularities and connectivity patterns.  This paper introduces Epitomic Variational Graph Autoencoder (EVGA), a novel graph-based generative model that leverages ideas from VAEs and graph neural networks. EVGA learns an expressive latent space by encoding graph structural information into a continuous vector representation while preserving important topological features. This allows us to capture complex dependencies within the data and generate new samples that faithfully represent the underlying structure. Our approach can handle datasets with varying sizes and node properties without any manual engineering or preprocessing steps.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets across different domains, including social network analysis, citation networks, and protein interactions. Results show that EVGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both quality of generated data and quality measures such as edge recall, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and F1 score. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of key design decisions and present visualizations to illustrate how our model captures meaningful relationships in the data.  Our work addresses current limitations in graph-based generative models and provides researchers and practitioners with a powerful tool for generating synthetic data that preserve essential characteristics of complex systems.

"Active learning (AL) on attributed graphs has received increasing attention with the prevalence of graph-structured data. Although AL has been widely studied for alleviating label sparsity issues with the conventional non-related data, how to make it effective over attributed graphs remains an open research question. Existing AL algorithms on graphs attempt to reuse the classic AL query strategies designed for non-related data. However, they suffer from two major limitations. First, different AL query strategies calculated in distinct scoring spaces are often naively combined to determine which nodes to be labelled. Second, the AL query engine and the learning of the classifier are treated as two separating processes, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a SEmi-supervised Adversarial active Learning (SEAL) framework on attributed graphs, which fully leverages the representation power of deep neural networks and devises a novel AL query strategy in an adversarial way. Our framework learns two adversarial components: a graph embedding network that encodes both the unlabelled and labelled nodes into a latent space, expecting to trick the discriminator to regard all nodes as already labelled, and a semi-supervised discriminator network that distinguishes the unlabelled from the existing labelled nodes in the latent space. The divergence score, generated by the discriminator in a unified latent space, serves as the informativeness measure to actively select the most informative node to be labelled by an oracle. The two adversarial components form a closed loop to mutually and simultaneously reinforce each other towards enhancing the active learning performance. Extensive experiments on four real-world networks validate the effectiveness of the SEAL framework with superior performance improvements to state-of-the-art baselines.",0
"In this paper, we introduce SEAL (Semi-Supervised Adversarial Active Learning on Attributed Graphs), a novel approach to learning from attributed graphs that have limited labeled data available.

We employ adversarial training within our framework to improve model robustness and generalization ability. Furthermore, we provide extensive experimental evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, SEAL offers a promising solution for learning on large-scale attributed networks where annotations are scarce.",1
"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have already demonstrated their powerful ability to model the irregular data, e.g., skeletal data in human action recognition, providing an exciting new way to fuse rich structural information for nodes residing in different parts of a graph. In human action recognition, current works introduce a dynamic graph generation mechanism to better capture the underlying semantic skeleton connections and thus improves the performance. In this paper, we provide an orthogonal way to explore the underlying connections. Instead of introducing an expensive dynamic graph generation paradigm, we build a more efficient GCN on a Riemann manifold, which we think is a more suitable space to model the graph data, to make the extracted representations fit the embedding matrix. Specifically, we present a novel spatial-temporal GCN (ST-GCN) architecture which is defined via the Poincar\'e geometry such that it is able to better model the latent anatomy of the structure data. To further explore the optimal projection dimension in the Riemann space, we mix different dimensions on the manifold and provide an efficient way to explore the dimension for each ST-GCN layer. With the final resulted architecture, we evaluate our method on two current largest scale 3D datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120. The comparison results show that the model could achieve a superior performance under any given evaluation metrics with only 40\% model size when compared with the previous best GCN method, which proves the effectiveness of our model.",0
"In recent years, skeletal action recognition has become increasingly important due to advances in motion capture technology. However, traditional approaches based on handcrafted features have limited performance since they cannot handle complex human movements and variations. To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored deep learning methods that can learn feature representations automatically from raw sensor data. One popular approach is using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) which model the relationships among joints in a coordinate system. Another approach is using autoencoders which encode time sequences into fixed-size vectors while preserving spatial and temporal structures. Both GCNs and autoencoders have shown promising results but their performance could still benefit from the integration of other modalities such as depth maps or optical flows. In this work, we propose MixDim, a novel framework that integrates multiple modalities such as depth maps and optical flows along with joint coordinates in Poincare geometry for more accurate 3D skeleton-based action recognition. We first introduce a new representation called Joint Depth Maps (JDMs) which project 3D joint positions onto a 2D plane under camera viewpoint. Then, we apply graph convolutions to both original joint coordinates and the newly generated JDMs in each modality space separately. Next, we combine different modalities by linearly mixing their learned embeddings before feeding them into our final classification network. Our experiments show consistent improvements across several benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",1

"Understanding how certain brain regions relate to a specific neurological disorder has been an important area of neuroimaging research. A promising approach to identify the salient regions is using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can be used to analyze graph structured data, e.g. brain networks constructed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We propose an interpretable GNN framework with a novel salient region selection mechanism to determine neurological brain biomarkers associated with disorders. Specifically, we design novel regularized pooling layers that highlight salient regions of interests (ROIs) so that we can infer which ROIs are important to identify a certain disease based on the node pooling scores calculated by the pooling layers. Our proposed framework, Pooling Regularized-GNN (PR-GNN), encourages reasonable ROI-selection and provides flexibility to preserve either individual- or group-level patterns. We apply the PR-GNN framework on a Biopoint Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD) fMRI dataset.

The salient ROI detection results show high correspondence with the previous neuroimaging-derived biomarkers for ASD.",0
"Abstract: Deep learning methods have recently shown promising results in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

We evaluate PRGNN on four publicly available fMRI datasets for different tasks, including motor task, working memory, affective processing, and visual stimulation. Experimental results demonstrate that PRGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark metrics and provides more accurate biomarkers than other methods. Our findings suggest that integrating spatial dependencies can significantly improve the interpretability of fMRI predictions by identifying functionally meaningful biomarkers.

"Graph convolutional networks gain remarkable success in semi-supervised learning on graph structured data. The key to graph-based semisupervised learning is capturing the smoothness of labels or features over nodes exerted by graph structure.

"The objective of active learning (AL) is to train classification models with less number of labeled instances by selecting only the most informative instances for labeling. The AL algorithms designed for other data types such as images and text do not perform well on graph-structured data. Although a few heuristics-based AL algorithms have been proposed for graphs, a principled approach is lacking. In this paper, we propose MetAL, an AL approach that selects unlabeled instances that directly improve the future performance of a classification model. For a semi-supervised learning problem, we formulate the AL task as a bilevel optimization problem. Based on recent work in meta-learning, we use the meta-gradients to approximate the impact of retraining the model with any unlabeled instance on the model performance.

"This paper presents a novel active semi-supervised learning algorithm called ""MetAL"" (Meta Learning on Graphs) that leverages meta learning principles for enhanced generalization performance across multiple data sets in graph data analysis tasks. Traditional semi-supervised methods assume either strong prior knowledge over the target function or complex models built upon large amounts of labeled data, which may limit their applicability in real-world scenarios where only limited labeled samples and edge features are available. To address these challenges, MetAL integrates meta learning techniques into the existing SSL framework, resulting in a more flexible method capable of capturing both global and local patterns from graph structure as well as adapting itself to specific datasets. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy, robustness, and stability compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in four different application domains: image classification, sentiment analysis, citation network analysis, and bioinformatics.

"Convolutional neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by one or more fully connected layers. While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors. Despite empirical success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening followed by fully connected layers discards multilinear structure in the activations and requires many parameters. We address these problems by incorporating tensor algebraic operations that preserve multilinear structure at every layer. First, we introduce Tensor Contraction Layers (TCLs) that reduce the dimensionality of their input while preserving their multilinear structure using tensor contraction. Next, we introduce Tensor Regression Layers (TRLs), which express outputs through a low-rank multilinear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to an output tensor of arbitrary order. We learn the contraction and regression factors end-to-end, and produce accurate nets with fewer parameters. Additionally, our layers regularize networks by imposing low-rank constraints on the activations (TCL) and regression weights (TRL). Experiments on ImageNet show that, applied to VGG and ResNet architectures, TCLs and TRLs reduce the number of parameters compared to fully connected layers by more than 65% while maintaining or increasing accuracy. In addition to the space savings, our approach's ability to leverage topological structure can be crucial for structured data such as MRI. In particular, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over comparable architectures on three tasks associated with the UK Biobank dataset.",0

"Active search is the process of identifying high-value data points in a large and often high-dimensional parameter space that can be expensive to evaluate. Traditional active search techniques like Bayesian optimization trade off exploration and exploitation over consecutive evaluations, and have historically focused on single or small (5) numbers of examples evaluated per round. As modern data sets grow, so does the need to scale active search to large data sets and batch sizes. In this paper, we present a general hierarchical framework based on bandit algorithms to scale active search to large batch sizes by maximizing information derived from the unique structure of each dataset. Our hierarchical framework, Hierarchical Batch Bandit Search (HBBS), strategically distributes batch selection across a learned embedding space by facilitating wide exploration of different structural elements within a dataset. We focus our application of HBBS on modern biology, where large batch experimentation is often fundamental to the research process, and demonstrate batch design of biological sequences (protein and DNA). We also present a new Gym environment to easily simulate diverse biological sequences and to enable more comprehensive evaluation of active search methods across heterogeneous data sets. The HBBS framework improves upon standard performance, wall-clock, and scalability benchmarks for batch search by using a broad exploration strategy across coarse partitions and fine-grained exploitation within each partition of structured data.",0

To demonstrate effectiveness, we evaluate our model on three real datasets and compare against current state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showcase significant improvements in query accuracy and scalability.",1
"Predicting interactions among heterogenous graph structured data has numerous applications such as knowledge graph completion, recommendation systems and drug discovery. Often times, the links to be predicted belong to rare types such as the case in repurposing drugs for novel diseases. This motivates the task of few-shot link prediction. Typically, GCNs are ill-equipped in learning such rare link types since the relation embedding is not learned in an inductive fashion. This paper proposes an inductive RGCN for learning informative relation embeddings even in the few-shot learning regime. The proposed inductive model significantly outperforms the RGCN and state-of-the-art KGE models in few-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we apply our method on the drug-repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG) for discovering drugs for Covid-19. We pose the drug discovery task as link prediction and learn embeddings for the biological entities that partake in the DRKG. Our initial results corroborate that several drugs used in clinical trials were identified as possible drug candidates. The method in this paper are implemented using the efficient deep graph learning (DGL)",0
"Title: ""Few-Shot Link Prediction for Covid-19 Drug Repurposing using Graph Neural Networks""  Drug repurposing has emerged as a promising approach for quickly finding new treatments for diseases like COVID-19 by reusing existing drugs. However, identifying potential candidates from vast databases of chemical structures requires accurate models that can predict how compounds interact within cells. In particular, few-shot learning - training on only a handful of examples - may provide advantages over traditional methods by allowing generalization across new situations and reducing computational requirements. We demonstrate state-of-the art performance for few-shot link prediction using graph neural networks on two benchmark datasets relevant to drug discovery. By pretraining on related bioactivity data, our model improves upon recent work applying GNNs for molecular graph classification tasks. Our study provides insight into the effectiveness of different attention mechanisms and the impact of pretraining when few labeled samples are available. This research opens up future opportunities to apply advanced machine learning techniques to accelerate biomedical discoveries during public health crises.",1
"Applying network science approaches to investigate the functions and anatomy of the human brain is prevalent in modern medical imaging analysis. Due to the complex network topology, for an individual brain, mining a discriminative network representation from the multimodal brain networks is non-trivial. The recent success of deep learning techniques on graph-structured data suggests a new way to model the non-linear cross-modality relationship. However, current deep brain network methods either ignore the intrinsic graph topology or require a network basis shared within a group. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end deep graph representation learning (Deep Multimodal Brain Networks - DMBN) to fuse multimodal brain networks. Specifically, we decipher the cross-modality relationship through a graph encoding and decoding process. The higher-order network mappings from brain structural networks to functional networks are learned in the node domain. The learned network representation is a set of node features that are informative to induce brain saliency maps in a supervised manner. We test our framework in both synthetic and real image data. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over some other state-of-the-art deep brain network models.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using deep learning techniques to analyze brain networks derived from multimodal neuroimaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). These methods have shown promise in providing insights into brain organization and function, but they are limited by their reliance on handcrafted features that may not fully capture complex patterns of connectivity present in the data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for deep representation learning in multimodal brain networks, which incorporates both fMRI activation maps and DTI white matter tractography. Our method leverages advances in graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs), which enable efficient processing of irregularly structured graphs representing brain connections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on publicly available datasets, showing improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods based on traditional feature extraction techniques. Our work highlights the potential of deep representation learning to advance the study of brain network organization and dynamics, opening up new opportunities for the development of personalized diagnostics and treatments in neuroscience.",1
"Despite diverse efforts to mine various modalities of medical data, the conversations between physicians and patients at the time of care remain an untapped source of insights. In this paper, we leverage this data to extract structured information that might assist physicians with post-visit documentation in electronic health records, potentially lightening the clerical burden. In this exploratory study, we describe a new dataset consisting of conversation transcripts, post-visit summaries, corresponding supporting evidence (in the transcript), and structured labels. We focus on the tasks of recognizing relevant diagnoses and abnormalities in the review of organ systems (RoS). One methodological challenge is that the conversations are long (around 1500 words), making it difficult for modern deep-learning models to use them as input. To address this challenge, we extract noteworthy utterances---parts of the conversation likely to be cited as evidence supporting some summary sentence. We find that by first filtering for (predicted) noteworthy utterances, we can significantly boost predictive performance for recognizing both diagnoses and RoS abnormalities.",0
"Abstraction: The extraction of structured data from physician-patient conversations holds great potential for improving healthcare quality and efficiency by providing valuable insights into patient diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. However, manually transcribing these conversations can be time-consuming and expensive. This study presents a novel approach that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to predict ""noteworthy"" utterances within conversations that contain important medical information. These predictions allow for automated extraction of relevant segments of the conversation while reducing human effort and cost. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over baseline methods, achieving F1 scores as high as 92%. This research contributes to the growing field of NLP applications in healthcare and has promising implications for future developments in extractive summarization and automatic question answering systems in medicine.",1
"Graph representation learning nowadays becomes fundamental in analyzing graph-structured data. Inspired by recent success of contrastive methods, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised graph representation learning by leveraging a contrastive objective at the node level. Specifically, we generate two graph views by corruption and learn node representations by maximizing the agreement of node representations in these two views. To provide diverse node contexts for the contrastive objective, we propose a hybrid scheme for generating graph views on both structure and attribute levels. Besides, we provide theoretical justification behind our motivation from two perspectives, mutual information and the classical triplet loss. We perform empirical experiments on both transductive and inductive learning tasks using a variety of real-world datasets. Experimental experiments demonstrate that despite its simplicity, our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Moreover, our unsupervised method even surpasses its supervised counterparts on transductive tasks, demonstrating its great potential in real-world applications.",0
"Here is an example of an abstract that meets these requirements: Abstract: In this paper we present deep graph contrastive representation learning (DGCRL), a new method for modeling complex relationships between data points by leveraging the power of graph neural networks. Our approach involves training two separate graph encoders on each instance of a dataset, one to encode positive pairs and another to encode negative pairs. These encoded representations are then used as inputs to our contrastive loss function, which enforces consistency between the positive pairs while encouraging discrimination against negative ones. Experimental results show significant improvement over baseline models across a variety of tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and visualization of large graphs. We believe DGCRL has broad applicability across many fields where graph-structured data is prevalent, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and web search. This work contributes to the growing body of literature focused on developing effective ways to learn from graph-structured data using machine learning techniques.",1
"Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an event processing paradigm to perform real-time analytics over streaming data and match high-level event patterns. Presently, CEP is limited to process structured data stream. Video streams are complicated due to their unstructured data model and limit CEP systems to perform matching over them. This work introduces a graph-based structure for continuous evolving video streams, which enables the CEP system to query complex video event patterns. We propose the Video Event Knowledge Graph (VEKG), a graph driven representation of video data. VEKG models video objects as nodes and their relationship interaction as edges over time and space. It creates a semantic knowledge representation of video data derived from the detection of high-level semantic concepts from the video using an ensemble of deep learning models. A CEP-based state optimization - VEKG-Time Aggregated Graph (VEKG-TAG) is proposed over VEKG representation for faster event detection. VEKG-TAG is a spatiotemporal graph aggregation method that provides a summarized view of the VEKG graph over a given time length. We defined a set of nine event pattern rules for two domains (Activity Recognition and Traffic Management), which act as a query and applied over VEKG graphs to discover complex event patterns. To show the efficacy of our approach, we performed extensive experiments over 801 video clips across 10 datasets. The proposed VEKG approach was compared with other state-of-the-art methods and was able to detect complex event patterns over videos with F-Score ranging from 0.44 to 0.90. In the given experiments, the optimized VEKG-TAG was able to reduce 99% and 93% of VEKG nodes and edges, respectively, with 5.19X faster search time, achieving sub-second median latency of 4-20 milliseconds.",0
"This approach uses semantic technologies that allow for richer annotations. For example, tags can represent different aspects of content based on the video stream itself (e.g., scene type), and temporal properties like time intervals from one event to another could also come into play as metadata. With tags serving as labels, data in complex event processing (CEP) becomes far more informative than keywords or search terms alone.",1
"We present Geo2DR (Geometric to Distributed Representations), a GPU ready Python library for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data using discrete substructure patterns and neural language models. It contains efficient implementations of popular graph decomposition algorithms and neural language models in PyTorch which can be combined to learn representations of graphs using the distributive hypothesis. Furthermore, Geo2DR comes with general data processing and loading methods to bring substantial speed-up in the training of the neural language models. Through this we provide a modular set of tools and methods to quickly construct systems capable of learning distributed representations of graphs. This is useful for replication of existing methods, modification, or development of completely new methods. This paper serves to present the Geo2DR library and perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of existing methods re-implemented using Geo2DR across widely used graph classification benchmarks. Geo2DR displays a high reproducibility of results in published methods and interoperability with other libraries useful for distributive language modelling.",0
"Graphs are everywhere and they come in different shapes and forms; social networks, citation graphs, knowledge bases etc. However, their representation is limited as most graph analysis tools are tailored towards undirected and unweighted graphs which is a poor fit for real world systems. In addition, existing graph analysis tools don’t scale well and can only handle graphs that have a few million edges/nodes at most. To overcome these limitations we proposed Geo2DR - Distributed Representation of Real valued signed weighted directed multi graph data by reducing them into continuous vectors in Euclidean space so it becomes amenable to deep learning techniques like machine learning algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as GCN(graph convolution network),Diffusion CNN,DeepSets, etc. We demonstrate how to train Geo2DR from large datasets (> billions of relationships across millions entities) using mini batch gradient descent optimizing reconstruction loss while keeping GPU memory usage to less than 4GB. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach on several benchmark datasets across recommendation systems and knowledge base completion tasks showing state of art results compared to all previous methods.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) extends the functionality of traditional neural networks to graph-structured data. Similar to CNNs, an optimized design of graph convolution and pooling is key to success. Borrowing ideas from physics, we propose a path integral based graph neural networks (PAN) for classification and regression tasks on graphs. Specifically, we consider a convolution operation that involves every path linking the message sender and receiver with learnable weights depending on the path length, which corresponds to the maximal entropy random walk. It generalizes the graph Laplacian to a new transition matrix we call maximal entropy transition (MET) matrix derived from a path integral formalism. Importantly, the diagonal entries of the MET matrix are directly related to the subgraph centrality, thus providing a natural and adaptive pooling mechanism. PAN provides a versatile framework that can be tailored for different graph data with varying sizes and structures. We can view most existing GNN architectures as special cases of PAN. Experimental results show that PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on various graph classification/regression tasks, including a new benchmark dataset from statistical mechanics we propose to boost applications of GNN in physical sciences.",0
"Deep convolution networks have shown their effectiveness on image data analysis tasks such as ImageNet and COCO detection/segmentation challenges by using transposed convolution or fractionally strided convolution (also known as dilated convolution) along with pooling layers like max-pooling and average-pooling. However, these operations fail to generalize well onto graph structured inputs due to their limited capability of encoding the intrinsic graph structure. In addition, state-of-theart graph neural network architectures mostly follow a message passing schema that combines neighbor features to encode local dependencies of the vertex itself and its neighbors. Motivated by recent successes of path integral based operations in graphs like variational autoencoders (VAEs), we propose to extend them into graph neural networks by applying a continuous relaxed representation of paths instead of discrete paths only up to some maximum length. By leveraging the path integral formulation, our proposed method can naturally encode global dependencies among nodes while offering computation efficiency through automatic differentiation supported backpropagation. This allows us to significantly reduce training time compared to traditional gradient descent methods without any negative effects on performance. Furthermore, inspired by classical graph filters, the proposed framework admits a natural extension towards convolution and pooling operations directly defined in frequency domain which further improves computational cost. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model against state-of-the-art models including GCN, GAT and APPNP across diverse datasets ranging from small scale molecular property prediction problems to large scale knowledge graphs (Freebase). Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over existing baselines while consuming fewer parameters and computational resources.",1
"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful deep learning approach for graph-structured data. Recently, GCNs and subsequent variants have shown superior performance in various application areas on real-world datasets. Despite their success, most of the current GCN models are shallow, due to the {\em over-smoothing} problem. In this paper, we study the problem of designing and analyzing deep graph convolutional networks. We propose the GCNII, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple yet effective techniques: {\em Initial residual} and {\em Identity mapping}. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the two techniques effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing. Our experiments show that the deep GCNII model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various semi- and full-supervised tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/chennnM/GCNII .",0
"In this paper we compare simple graph convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures with deep CNN architectures on graphs containing millions of nodes and tens of thousands of edges. We show that these models yield similar results when trained with standard data splits and hyperparameters. However, since each layer in the deep CNN architecture requires many additional parameters compared to layers in shallow CNN architectures, training and inference times as well as model sizes become larger when using deep CNN architectures. Motivated by recent developments such as MobileNet and EfficientNet which employ lightweight architectures based upon depthwise separable convolutions for computer vision tasks on images, we propose here equivalent approaches based upon pointwise and crosswise self attention mechanisms for graphs with billions of possible edges but only small neighborhood sizes. Our proposed architecture achieves competitive performance at significantly smaller model size, faster training time, and lower inference latency than stateof-the-art methods while providing better accuracy over simpler GCN variants without any additional computational cost during evaluation",1
"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently become the primary choice for learning from graph-structured data, superseding hash fingerprints in representing chemical compounds. However, GCNs lack the ability to take into account the ordering of node neighbors, even when there is a geometric interpretation of the graph vertices that provides an order based on their spatial positions. To remedy this issue, we propose Spatial Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) which uses spatial features to efficiently learn from graphs that can be naturally located in space. Our contribution is threefold: we propose a GCN-inspired architecture which (i) leverages node positions, (ii) is a proper generalization of both GCNs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), (iii) benefits from augmentation which further improves the performance and assures invariance with respect to the desired properties. Empirically, SGCN outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based methods on image classification and chemical tasks.",0
"Graph convolution networks (GCN) have proven effective at modeling graph structured data while traditional CNN cannot directly process irregular meshes due to their strong dependency on grid-like topology. In this work we propose spatial graph convolution that allows us to incorporate vertex coordinates into GCN without changing the core architecture. We introduce a new weight parameter which adaptively fuses both graph connectivity and vertex attributes by solving linear systems locally on each patch of the input graphs. Our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods such as GAT, SagePool and MLP on two benchmark datasets: Cora and Citeseer. On the larger dataset, Pubmed, our model achieves superior performance compared to all competitors considered. The code and pretrained models will be released upon acceptance of this paper.",1
"Complex applications such as big data analytics involve different forms of coupling relationships that reflect interactions between factors related to technical, business (domain-specific) and environmental (including socio-cultural and economic) aspects. There are diverse forms of couplings embedded in poor-structured and ill-structured data. Such couplings are ubiquitous, implicit and/or explicit, objective and/or subjective, heterogeneous and/or homogeneous, presenting complexities to existing learning systems in statistics, mathematics and computer sciences, such as typical dependency, association and correlation relationships. Modeling and learning such couplings thus is fundamental but challenging. This paper discusses the concept of coupling learning, focusing on the involvement of coupling relationships in learning systems. Coupling learning has great potential for building a deep understanding of the essence of business problems and handling challenges that have not been addressed well by existing learning theories and tools. This argument is verified by several case studies on coupling learning, including handling coupling in recommender systems, incorporating couplings into coupled clustering, coupling document clustering, coupled recommender algorithms and coupled behavior analysis for groups.",0

"We introduce a family of multilayer graph kernels and establish new links between graph convolutional neural networks and kernel methods. Our approach generalizes convolutional kernel networks to graph-structured data, by representing graphs as a sequence of kernel feature maps, where each node carries information about local graph substructures. On the one hand, the kernel point of view offers an unsupervised, expressive, and easy-to-regularize data representation, which is useful when limited samples are available. On the other hand, our model can also be trained end-to-end on large-scale data, leading to new types of graph convolutional neural networks.

Predicting and discovering drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is an important problem and has been studied extensively both from medical and machine learning point of view. Almost all of the machine learning approaches have focused on text data or textual representation of the structural data of drugs. We present the first work that uses drug structure images as the input and utilizes a Siamese convolutional network architecture to predict DDIs.,0
"Here is one possible abstract:  Motivation: Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for improving patient safety and optimizing drug therapy outcomes. While current methods primarily rely on textual data such as chemical names, protein targets, and side effects, there exists a wealth of information encoded in molecular structures that remains unexploited by existing approaches. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework based on siamese neural networks to predict potential DDIs directly from 2D molecular structure images.  Methods: We developed a convolutional neural network architecture capable of encoding molecular structures into fixed-length feature vectors suitable for similarity computations. Our method leverages siamese networks, which are trained to identify similarities/differences between two input images, thus enabling accurate prediction of DDI probabilities without relying exclusively on chemical descriptors. In addition, we evaluated our approach against state-of-the-art deep learning models, traditional machine learning algorithms, and benchmark databases (Kidney Disease and Chinese Herbal Medicine, KID database).  Results: Experimental results demonstrate that our molecular imaging approach significantly enhances predictive accuracy over competitive baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, including precision at k top predictions and receiver operating characteristic curves. Importantly, qualitative analyses reveal insights into how structural features contribute to specific DDI scenarios that cannot be easily captured through manual analysis alone.  Conclusion: This study marks the first step towards exploiting rich molecular structure data to better characterize DDIs. By exploring alternative sources of pharmacological knowledge beyond classical textual evidence, our findings hold promise for informing more nuanced predictions, identifying new mechanisms underlying drug incompatibilities, and ultimately driving more personalized medicine decisions.",1
"Graph neural networks are promising architecture for learning and inference with graph-structured data. Yet difficulties in modelling the ``parts'' and their ``interactions'' still persist in terms of graph classification, where graph-level representations are usually obtained by squeezing the whole graph into a single vector through graph pooling. From complex systems point of view, mixing all the parts of a system together can affect both model interpretability and predictive performance, because properties of a complex system arise largely from the interaction among its components. We analyze the intrinsic difficulty in graph classification under the unified concept of ``resolution dilemmas'' with learning theoretic recovery guarantees, and propose ``SLIM'', an inductive neural network model for Structural Landmarking and Interaction Modelling. It turns out, that by solving the resolution dilemmas, and leveraging explicit interacting relation between component parts of a graph to explain its complexity, SLIM is more interpretable, accurate, and offers new insight in graph representation learning.",0
"This should include some background information and an overview of your method. Here is my attempt at writing one myself, please tell me how you would improve upon it:  Abstract: This paper focuses on graph classification problems where we aim to predict labels given node features as input. We study two key tasks involved in building graph learning models: structured landmark selection (landmark discovery) and interaction model training/validation/testing. To this end, we introduce a novel framework that effectively learns discriminative yet generalizable landmarks without relying on external measures like nodal degrees. Our work resolves longstanding resolution dilemma issues by addressing them directly rather than side-stepping or postponing their solutions. Consequently, our approach outperforms the state-of-the art and uncovers previously unknown challenges concerning existing techniques across several benchmark datasets. Finally, our contributions facilitate future research into developing scalable and accurate solutions for real-world complex systems problems involving high-dimensional data.  This paper investigates graph classification methods, which involve using node features to predict labels for graphs. Two fundamental aspects of these approaches - landmark identification and interaction modelling - are examined within a new framework. Unlike traditional strategies dependent on properties such as node degree, this technique autonomously discovers informative landmarks free from additional metrics. By tackling prevalent resolution conundrums head-on, our solution eclipses current standards while revealing hidden weaknesses regarding prevailing practices.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to be powerful in modeling graph-structured data. However, training GNNs usually requires abundant task-specific labeled data, which is often arduously expensive to obtain. One effective way to reduce the labeling effort is to pre-train an expressive GNN model on unlabeled data with self-supervision and then transfer the learned model to downstream tasks with only a few labels. In this paper, we present the GPT-GNN framework to initialize GNNs by generative pre-training. GPT-GNN introduces a self-supervised attributed graph generation task to pre-train a GNN so that it can capture the structural and semantic properties of the graph. We factorize the likelihood of the graph generation into two components: 1) Attribute Generation and 2) Edge Generation. By modeling both components, GPT-GNN captures the inherent dependency between node attributes and graph structure during the generative process. Comprehensive experiments on the billion-scale Open Academic Graph and Amazon recommendation data demonstrate that GPT-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models without pre-training by up to 9.1% across various downstream tasks.",0

"Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have made great progress recently on learning from graph-structured data in practice, their theoretical guarantee on generalizability remains elusive in the literature. In this paper, we provide a theoretically-grounded generalizability analysis of GNNs with one hidden layer for both regression and binary classification problems. Under the assumption that there exists a ground-truth GNN model (with zero generalization error), the objective of GNN learning is to estimate the ground-truth GNN parameters from the training data. To achieve this objective, we propose a learning algorithm that is built on tensor initialization and accelerated gradient descent. We then show that the proposed learning algorithm converges to the ground-truth GNN model for the regression problem, and to a model sufficiently close to the ground-truth for the binary classification problem. Moreover, for both cases, the convergence rate of the proposed learning algorithm is proven to be linear and faster than the vanilla gradient descent algorithm. We further explore the relationship between the sample complexity of GNNs and their underlying graph properties. Lastly, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity of our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm for GNNs.",0

"Graphs are ubiquitous in modelling relational structures. Recent endeavours in machine learning for graph-structured data have led to many architectures and learning algorithms. However, the graph used by these algorithms is often constructed based on inaccurate modelling assumptions and/or noisy data. As a result, it fails to represent the true relationships between nodes. A Bayesian framework which targets posterior inference of the graph by considering it as a random quantity can be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric graph model for constructing the posterior distribution of graph adjacency matrices. The proposed model is flexible in the sense that it can effectively take into account the output of graph-based learning algorithms that target specific tasks. In addition, model inference scales well to large graphs. We demonstrate the advantages of this model in three different problem settings: node classification, link prediction and recommendation.",0
"""Non-Parametric Graph Learning"" should take up one line in the final version, followed by subtitle.  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved great success in many applications, including node classification and link prediction tasks on graphs. However, most GNN methods assume that the graph structure is fixed and known beforehand. In reality, real-world networks often evolve over time due to changes in data and dynamics. Therefore, it is essential to develop flexible models that can adapt to such evolutions while maintaining their performance. We present Non-parametric Graph Learning (NPG), a novel method designed specifically to handle dynamic network structures using Gaussian processes and variational inference techniques, which enables efficient learning of complex functions on graph structures without relying on a predefined architecture. Our approach has been evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy across all considered tasks, including node classification, edge attribute prediction, and link prediction. By combining the advantages of non-parametric modeling with graph neural networks, we achieve highly competitive results compared to other baseline methods under both static and dynamic settings. With our work, researchers now have access to a powerful tool capable of handling unpredictable network structure change during runtime, paving the way for more robust and resilient GNN applications.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved a lot of success on graph-structured data. However, it is observed that the performance of graph neural networks does not improve as the number of layers increases. This effect, known as over-smoothing, has been analyzed mostly in linear cases. In this paper, we build upon previous results \cite{oono2019graph} to further analyze the over-smoothing effect in the general graph neural network architecture. We show when the weight matrix satisfies the conditions determined by the spectrum of augmented normalized Laplacian, the Dirichlet energy of embeddings will converge to zero, resulting in the loss of discriminative power. Using Dirichlet energy to measure ""expressiveness"" of embedding is conceptually clean; it leads to simpler proofs than \cite{oono2019graph} and can handle more non-linearities.",0

"Graph classification aims to extract accurate information from graph-structured data for classification and is becoming more and more important in graph learning community. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to graph classification tasks, most of them overlook the scarcity of labeled graph data in many applications. For example, in bioinformatics, obtaining protein graph labels usually needs laborious experiments. Recently, few-shot learning has been explored to alleviate this problem with only given a few labeled graph samples of test classes. The shared sub-structures between training classes and test classes are essential in few-shot graph classification. Exiting methods assume that the test classes belong to the same set of super-classes clustered from training classes. However, according to our observations, the label spaces of training classes and test classes usually do not overlap in real-world scenario. As a result, the existing methods don't well capture the local structures of unseen test classes. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a direct method to capture the sub-structures with well initialized meta-learner within a few adaptation steps. More specifically, (1) we propose a novel framework consisting of a graph meta-learner, which uses GNNs based modules for fast adaptation on graph data, and a step controller for the robustness and generalization of meta-learner; (2) we provide quantitative analysis for the framework and give a graph-dependent upper bound of the generalization error based on our framework; (3) the extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework gets state-of-the-art results on several few-shot graph classification tasks compared to baselines.",0
"One possible abstract:  A critical challenge in graph classification tasks is to learn from few labeled examples while adapting to new domains quickly without sacrificing performance on previously seen ones. Recent developments have suggested learning algorithms that can successfully perform meta-learning (i.e., ""learning to learn"") by training on multiple related tasks to improve generalization across tasks; however, these methods still encounter difficulties when faced with limited data scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a novel method termed the Adaptive-Step Graph Meta-Learner (ASGML), which effectively adapts to new domains by leveraging both global task relations and local sample adaptation through a hierarchical two-step updating mechanism, using only a handful of annotated samples per class. ASGML progressively integrates knowledge learned during previous steps into current model updates via iterative optimization. Our results show consistent improvements over competitive baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency for datasets spanning diverse applications including social networks, bioinformatics, and web graphs. The efficacy of our framework demonstrates its potential as a powerful tool for tackling real world graph mining problems requiring minimal supervision.",1
"The success of deep learning has revolutionized many fields of research including areas of computer vision, text and speech processing. Enormous research efforts have led to numerous methods that are capable of efficiently analyzing data, especially in the Euclidean space. However, many problems are posed in non-Euclidean domains modeled as general graphs with complex connection patterns. Increased problem complexity and computational power constraints have limited early approaches to static and small-sized graphs. In recent years, a rising interest in machine learning on graph-structured data has been accompanied by improved methods that overcome the limitations of their predecessors. These methods paved the way for dealing with large-scale and time-dynamic graphs. This work aims to provide an overview of early and modern graph neural network based machine learning methods for node-level prediction tasks. Under the umbrella of taxonomies already established in the literature, we explain the core concepts and provide detailed explanations for convolutional methods that have had strong impact. In addition, we introduce common benchmarks and present selected applications from various areas. Finally, we discuss open problems for further research.",0
"Graph neural networks have emerged as powerful models for graph data due to their ability to capture complex relationships between nodes and edges. In recent years, there has been significant interest in using graph neural networks for predictive tasks such as node classification and regression. However, current state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on edge-level predictions and lack effective ways to model node features in a local context. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network architecture that makes explicit use of node features and incorporates both spatial and spectral information through attention mechanisms. Our method can accurately learn from graph structure while capturing relevant node feature representations by focusing on neighborhood patterns rather than relying exclusively on global information propagation. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains. We believe our contributions will pave the way towards more efficient and accurate solutions for node-level prediction problems in graphs.",1
"We consider the problem of whether a given decision model, working with structured data, has individual fairness. Following the work of Dwork, a model is individually biased (or unfair) if there is a pair of valid inputs which are close to each other (according to an appropriate metric) but are treated differently by the model (different class label, or large difference in output), and it is unbiased (or fair) if no such pair exists. Our objective is to construct verifiers for proving individual fairness of a given model, and we do so by considering appropriate relaxations of the problem. We construct verifiers which are sound but not complete for linear classifiers, and kernelized polynomial/radial basis function classifiers. We also report the experimental results of evaluating our proposed algorithms on publicly available datasets.",0
"In recent years, machine learning models have been increasingly used to make important decisions that affect individuals, such as loan approvals, hiring decisions, and sentencing recommendations. However, concerns about individual fairness in these decision-making processes have arisen due to potential biases present in training data and algorithms. This study aims to address these concerns by proposing novel techniques for verifying individual fairness in machine learning models.  The proposed methods utilize statistical testing procedures to examine whether certain subgroups of the population are treated unfairly by the model. These tests can detect differences in treatment across different demographic groups, and provide insight into how individual fairness might be improved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets commonly used in fairness evaluations, including those involving credit scoring, job applications, and criminal justice outcomes.  Results show that our methods are able to successfully identify cases where individual fairness may be lacking. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that common practices in the field of machine learning may actually worsen individual fairness rather than improving it. Our work contributes to the growing literature on fairness in artificial intelligence, emphasizing the importance of formal methods for ensuring equitable decision making. Ultimately, we hope that our research can inform more ethical use of machine learning models in high stakes decision contexts.",1
"Graph deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful ML concept allowing to generalize successful deep neural architectures to non-Euclidean structured data. Such methods have shown promising results on a broad spectrum of applications ranging from social science, biomedicine, and particle physics to computer vision, graphics, and chemistry. One of the limitations of the majority of the current graph neural network architectures is that they are often restricted to the transductive setting and rely on the assumption that the underlying graph is known and fixed. In many settings, such as those arising in medical and healthcare applications, this assumption is not necessarily true since the graph may be noisy, partially- or even completely unknown, and one is thus interested in inferring it from the data. This is especially important in inductive settings when dealing with nodes not present in the graph at training time. Furthermore, sometimes such a graph itself may convey insights that are even more important than the downstream task. In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Graph Module (DGM), a learnable function predicting the edge probability in the graph relevant for the task, that can be combined with convolutional graph neural network layers and trained in an end-to-end fashion. We provide an extensive evaluation of applications from the domains of healthcare (disease prediction), brain imaging (gender and age prediction), computer graphics (3D point cloud segmentation), and computer vision (zero-shot learning). We show that our model provides a significant improvement over baselines both in transductive and inductive settings and achieves state-of-the-art results.",0
"In the world of deep learning, graph convolutional networks have proven themselves to be powerful tools for analyzing complex graphs such as social network data or protein structures. However, many current models rely on fixed architectures that cannot easily adapt to different types of problems or datasets. This can lead to suboptimal results or even failure in some cases.  To address these issues, researchers proposed the differentiable graph module (DGM), which allows for flexible and modular construction of graph convolutional networks. Instead of relying on predefined connections between nodes, the DGM uses a learnable attention mechanism to selectively combine node features from any arbitrary graph structure.  The authors evaluated their approach on several benchmark datasets including citation, co-purchase, and bioinformatics domains. They found that the DGM outperformed state-of-the-art graph convolutional networks across all tasks while reducing model size and computational complexity. Moreover, they showed that the DGM generalizes well to larger graphs, making it suitable for real-world applications where scale and accuracy are critical.  Overall, the differentiable graph module represents a significant advancement in graph convolutional networks by enabling efficient adaptation to diverse graph topologies without sacrificing performance. Its ability to learn optimal representations directly from raw graph data makes it highly attractive for future research in areas ranging from computer vision to natural language processing.",1
"Applying machine learning algorithms to private data, such as financial or medical data, while preserving their confidentiality, is a difficult task. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is acknowledged for its ability to allow computation on encrypted data, where both the input and output are encrypted, which therefore enables secure inference on private data. Nonetheless, because of the constraints of HE, such as its inability to evaluate non-polynomial functions or to perform arbitrary matrix multiplication efficiently, only inference of linear models seem usable in practice in the HE paradigm so far.   In this paper, we propose Cryptotree, a framework that enables the use of Random Forests (RF), a very powerful learning procedure compared to linear regression, in the context of HE. To this aim, we first convert a regular RF to a Neural RF, then adapt this to fit the HE scheme CKKS, which allows HE operations on real values. Through SIMD operations, we are able to have quick inference and prediction results better than the original RF on encrypted data.",0

In addition, the authors provide insight into potential future applications of Cryptotree, such as personalized medicine and financial fraud detection. Overall, this paper offers a promising solution for enabling secure machine learning on sensitive data, paving the way for a wide range of valuable use cases.",1
"Graph Attention Network (GAT) and GraphSAGE are neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data and have been widely studied for link prediction and node classification. One challenge raised by GraphSAGE is how to smartly combine neighbour features based on graph structure. GAT handles this problem through attention, however the challenge with GAT is its scalability over large and dense graphs. In this work, we proposed a new architecture to address these issues that is more efficient and is capable of incorporating different edge type information. It generates node representations by attending to neighbours sampled from weighted multi-step transition probabilities. We conduct experiments on both transductive and inductive settings. Experiments achieved comparable or better results on several graph benchmarks, including the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, PPI, Twitter, and YouTube datasets.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to graph representation learning using adaptive sampling techniques. Traditional methods rely on fixed graph structures which can limit their ability to capture important features and patterns present in complex datasets. Our proposed method uses a combination of random walks and sampling algorithms to explore different subgraphs within the original graph. By doing so, we can identify diverse and representative samples that better reflect the overall structure and characteristics of the dataset.  We use these sampled graphs as input to our neural network architecture, allowing us to learn meaningful representations that generalize well across multiple tasks. We evaluate the performance of our model on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.  The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel framework for exploring large graphs using adaptive sampling; (ii) a detailed analysis of how different types of sampling affect graph representation learning; and (iii) empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging problems. Our findings have implications for a range of applications including recommender systems, fraud detection, and social network analysis. Overall, our research highlights the importance of considering graph topology and structure in order to achieve high quality representation learning.",1
"Nowadays, graph-structured data are increasingly used to model complex systems. Meanwhile, detecting anomalies from graph has become a vital research problem of pressing societal concerns. Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning task of identifying rare data that differ from the majority. As one of the dominant anomaly detection algorithms, One Class Support Vector Machine has been widely used to detect outliers. However, those traditional anomaly detection methods lost their effectiveness in graph data. Since traditional anomaly detection methods are stable, robust and easy to use, it is vitally important to generalize them to graph data. In this work, we propose One Class Graph Neural Network (OCGNN), a one-class classification framework for graph anomaly detection. OCGNN is designed to combine the powerful representation ability of Graph Neural Networks along with the classical one-class objective. Compared with other baselines, OCGNN achieves significant improvements in extensive experiments.",0
"Abstract: One Class GNN (OCGNN) has been applied successfully in several real-world use cases for anomaly detection on attributed networks such as molecules in chemistry, proteins sequences, and social network data. In each application, OC2GNN first learns a representation from normal examples only and then uses that representation for detecting anomalies. With limited labeled data available for these tasks, training deep learning models can often fail due to overfitting. To mitigate this problem, one approach involves pretraining a model using larger amounts of unlabeled data before fine-tuning with small amounts of labeled data. This study investigates how well OC2GNN performs compared to other methods like Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks. Our results show that while pretrained autoencoders work surprisingly well at both preserving structure and reducing reconstruction error they are outperformed by our proposed model which works directly on graphs with no need for graph reductions or other preprocessing steps required for most other approaches on graphs. We further demonstrate that the performance benefits extend to multiple different applications and datasets. Overall, we find strong evidence that one class GNN is an effective method for anomaly detection on attributed networks, achieving better accuracy than previously reported state-of-the-art results across many datasets.",1

"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been successfully applied to analyze non-grid data, where the classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot be directly used. One similarity shared by GCNs and CNNs is the requirement of massive amount of labeled data for network training. In addition, GCNs need the adjacency matrix as input to define the relationship between those non-grid data, which leads to all of data including training, validation and test data typically forms only one graph structures data for training. Furthermore, the adjacency matrix is usually pre-defined and stationary, which makes the data augmentation strategies cannot be employed on the constructed graph structures data to augment the amount of training data. To further improve the learning capacity and model performance under the limited training data, in this paper, we propose two types of self-supervised learning strategies to exploit available information from the input graph structure data itself. Our proposed self-supervised learning strategies are examined on two representative GCN models with three public citation network datasets - Citeseer, Cora and Pubmed. The experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability as well as the portability of our proposed strategies, which can significantly improve the performance of GCNs with the power of self-supervised learning in improving feature learning.",0
"Title: Unsupervised Learning of Graph Representations via Message Passing Neural Networks  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex relationships between nodes in graph data structures. While supervised training has proven effective in improving GNN performance on specific tasks, unsupervised methods can offer more robust representations by capturing general patterns across graphs without task-specific labels. We present a new approach that leverages self-supervision from a simple message passing algorithm based on graph signal processing theory. Our method adapts pre-trained GCNs to better align their node embeddings with those produced by our self-supervised method, resulting in superior performance on downstream node classification benchmarks. In addition, we evaluate the quality of the learned representations using link prediction and clustering metrics. Experiments show consistent improvements over existing state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques on a wide range of datasets. This work represents a step towards developing practical and efficient unsupervised learning algorithms capable of generating high-quality graph representations that transfer well across diverse domains and tasks.",1
"We present Graph Random Neural Features (GRNF), a novel embedding method from graph-structured data to real vectors based on a family of graph neural networks. The embedding naturally deals with graph isomorphism and preserves the metric structure of the graph domain, in probability. In addition to being an explicit embedding method, it also allows us to efficiently and effectively approximate graph metric distances (as well as complete kernel functions); a criterion to select the embedding dimension trading off the approximation accuracy with the computational cost is also provided. GRNF can be used within traditional processing methods or as a training-free input layer of a graph neural network. The theoretical guarantees that accompany GRNF ensure that the considered graph distance is metric, hence allowing to distinguish any pair of non-isomorphic graphs.",0
"This paper proposes a new method called graph random neural features (GRAF) for distance-preserving graph representations that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on several tasks including link prediction, node classification, and clustering. GRAF builds upon recent advances in graph representation learning by using deep neural networks to learn global, nonlinear features from graphs. These features can then be used as input for machine learning models to solve downstream problems such as graph regression, ranking, or binary classification. Unlike previous methods, GRAF randomly selects pairs of nodes from the original graph at each training iteration and learns their corresponding pairwise distances directly from data, resulting in more robust and accurate feature embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different benchmark datasets and model architectures. Our code will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in the field.",1
"Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a theoretically-backed and popular framework for deep generative models. However, learning a VAE from data poses still unanswered theoretical questions and considerable practical challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative framework for generative modeling that is simpler, easier to train, and deterministic, yet has many of the advantages of VAEs. We observe that sampling a stochastic encoder in a Gaussian VAE can be interpreted as simply injecting noise into the input of a deterministic decoder. We investigate how substituting this kind of stochasticity, with other explicit and implicit regularization schemes, can lead to an equally smooth and meaningful latent space without forcing it to conform to an arbitrarily chosen prior. To retrieve a generative mechanism to sample new data, we introduce an ex-post density estimation step that can be readily applied also to existing VAEs, improving their sample quality. We show, in a rigorous empirical study, that the proposed regularized deterministic autoencoders are able to generate samples that are comparable to, or better than, those of VAEs and more powerful alternatives when applied to images as well as to structured data such as molecules. \footnote{An implementation is available at: \url{https://github.com/ParthaEth/Regularized_autoencoders-RAE-}}",0
"Abstract:  In recent years, autoencoder have gained significant attention as powerful tools in unsupervised machine learning due to their ability to generate data representations that capture underlying patterns within datasets. However, current methods for training these models often suffer from issues related to optimization difficulties, poor interpretability, and inability to handle arbitrary likelihood functions. Here we present a new methodology for generating compressed yet informative data encodings using deterministic autoencoders (dAEs). Our approach utilizes a non-probabilistic framework that learns to map raw inputs onto latent codes directly, allowing us to leverage more efficient optimizers while providing transparency into model behavior. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets the effectiveness of our proposed dAE model compared against state-of-the-art variational autoencoders. Our results show improved performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including generation fidelity, reconstruction accuracy, and encoding compactness. Overall, these findings indicate that dAEs provide a viable alternative for those seeking enhanced capabilities beyond traditional variational approaches.

"Graph classification is an important task on graph-structured data with many real-world applications. The goal of graph classification task is to train a classifier using a set of training graphs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the task of graph classification. When building a GNN model for graph classification, the graphs in the training set are usually assumed to be identically distributed. However, in many real-world applications, graphs in the same dataset could have dramatically different structures, which indicates that these graphs are likely non-identically distributed. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop graph neural networks for graphs that are not non-identically distributed. Specifically, we propose a general non-IID graph neural network framework, i.e., Non-IID-GNN. Given a graph, Non-IID-GNN can adapt any existing graph neural network model to generate a sample-specific model for this graph. Comprehensive experiments on various graph classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We will release the code of the proposed framework upon the acceptance of the paper.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing data that can be represented by graphs. Unlike traditional deep learning models, GNNs can learn representations on nonlinear entities such as nodes and edges without requiring heavy preprocessing steps. However, these methods assume independent and identically distributed (IID) node features, which may limit their performance when applied to real-world datasets where IID assumptions do not hold. This paper introduces a novel framework called non-IID graph neural networks (NIGNNs), aimed at overcoming these limitations and improving the accuracy and interpretability of GNN predictions on non-IID data. The proposed approach combines multiple layers of representation learning with robust feature generation techniques to capture complex patterns and dependencies across highly variable datasets. Results demonstrate that NIGNNs achieve significant improvements in predictive accuracy compared to existing IID GNN architectures. These findings provide new insights into the impact of distributional heterogeneity in graph data and highlight the importance of developing more flexible GNN architectures that can adapt to diverse and unpredictable conditions.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are efficient approaches to process graph-structured data. Modelling long-distance node relations is essential for GNN training and applications. However, conventional GNNs suffer from bad performance in modelling long-distance node relations due to limited-layer information propagation. Existing studies focus on building deep GNN architectures, which face the over-smoothing issue and cannot model node relations in particularly long distance. To address this issue, we propose to model long-distance node relations by simply relying on shallow GNN architectures with two solutions: (1) Implicitly modelling by learning to predict node pair relations (2) Explicitly modelling by adding edges between nodes that potentially have the same label. To combine our two solutions, we propose a model-agnostic training framework named HighwayGraph, which overcomes the challenge of insufficient labeled nodes by sampling node pairs from the training set and adopting the self-training method. Extensive experimental results show that our HighwayGraph achieves consistent and significant improvements over four representative GNNs on three benchmark datasets.",0

"Learning on graph structured data has drawn increasing interest in recent years. Frameworks like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have demonstrated their ability to capture structural information and obtain good performance in various tasks. In these frameworks, node aggregation schemes are typically used to capture structural information: a node's feature vector is recursively computed by aggregating features of its neighboring nodes. However, most of aggregation schemes treat all connections in a graph equally, ignoring node feature similarities. In this paper, we re-interpret node aggregation from the perspective of kernel weighting, and present a framework to consider feature similarity in an aggregation scheme. Specifically, we show that normalized adjacency matrix is equivalent to a neighbor-based kernel matrix in a Krein Space. We then propose feature aggregation as the composition of the original neighbor-based kernel and a learnable kernel to encode feature similarities in a feature space. We further show how the proposed method can be extended to Graph Attention Network (GAT). Experimental results demonstrate better performance of our proposed framework in several real-world applications.",0
"Abstract: Modern computer vision problems require powerful models which can handle complex tasks such as object recognition in images and videos. One popular approach to achieve these requirements has been using deep neural networks and specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN). Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have shown promising results on several computer vision datasets. However, most GNN architectures rely heavily on standard kernel functions which may limit their expressive power compared to CNNs. To address this limitation, we propose the use of composite kernels within the context of GNNs. In particular, we combine elementwise operations (such as multiplication, division, square root) with regular kernel functions (such as ReLU, sigmoid, softmax). We show that our proposed architecture achieves competitive performance while reducing model size and number of parameters, making it more efficient than traditional approaches.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful to learn the representation of graph-structured data. Most of the GNNs use the message-passing scheme, where the embedding of a node is iteratively updated by aggregating the information of its neighbors. To achieve a better expressive capability of node influences, attention mechanism has grown to be popular to assign trainable weights to the nodes in aggregation. Though the attention-based GNNs have achieved remarkable results in various tasks, a clear understanding of their discriminative capacities is missing. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of the representational properties of the GNN that adopts the attention mechanism as an aggregator. Our analysis determines all cases when those attention-based GNNs can always fail to distinguish certain distinct structures. Those cases appear due to the ignorance of cardinality information in attention-based aggregation. To improve the performance of attention-based GNNs, we propose cardinality preserved attention (CPA) models that can be applied to any kind of attention mechanisms. Our experiments on node and graph classification confirm our theoretical analysis and show the competitive performance of our CPA models.",0
"Title: Improving attention mechanism in graph neural networks through cardinality preservation Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data structures represented by graphs. One key component of GNN architectures is their attention mechanism, which allows the network to selectively focus on certain aspects of the input graph during training. However, current attention mechanisms in GNNs suffer from several limitations that can lead to suboptimal performance. In particular, they may struggle to capture the unique characteristics of different types of graphs, such as those with varying levels of connectivity or differing node degrees. This can result in poor accuracy and missed opportunities for learning important patterns from the data. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called card",1
"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely used due to their outstanding performance in processing graph-structured data. However, the undirected graphs limit their application scope. In this paper, we extend spectral-based graph convolution to directed graphs by using first- and second-order proximity, which can not only retain the connection properties of the directed graph, but also expand the receptive field of the convolution operation. A new GCN model, called DGCN, is then designed to learn representations on the directed graph, leveraging both the first- and second-order proximity information. We empirically show the fact that GCNs working only with DGCNs can encode more useful information from graph and help achieve better performance when generalized to other models. Moreover, extensive experiments on citation networks and co-purchase datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant advancements over recent years due to deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In particular, graph CNNs have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling irregular data structures like graphs by exploiting their underlying spatial patterns. These models can learn representations that capture important features from raw data, making them valuable for tasks like node classification, link prediction, community detection, and edge classification. While these methods have been successful, they often suffer from limited interpretability since they rely on the learned weights between nodes which may change during inference time and cannot be directly visualized/inspected. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to apply graph CNNs across different domains. Therefore, we propose Directed Graph Convolutional Networks (DGCNs) aimed at addressing these limitations. By introducing direct connections between neighboring layers within our DGCN architecture, we enforce sparsity constraints to make our learned weights interpretable while still maintaining high accuracy for several datasets commonly used as benchmarks. Our results showcase improved performance compared to state-of-the-art GCNs while providing a more transparent interpretation process. With these advantages, DGCNs could potentially revolutionize the field of AI and further push the boundaries of applications using graph data.",1
"Representation learning over graph structured data has been mostly studied in static graph settings while efforts for modeling dynamic graphs are still scant. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical variational model that introduces additional latent random variables to jointly model the hidden states of a graph recurrent neural network (GRNN) to capture both topology and node attribute changes in dynamic graphs. We argue that the use of high-level latent random variables in this variational GRNN (VGRNN) can better capture potential variability observed in dynamic graphs as well as the uncertainty of node latent representation. With semi-implicit variational inference developed for this new VGRNN architecture (SI-VGRNN), we show that flexible non-Gaussian latent representations can further help dynamic graph analytic tasks. Our experiments with multiple real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that SI-VGRNN and VGRNN consistently outperform the existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in dynamic link prediction.",0
"Deep learning has revolutionized many fields by demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on numerous tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Among all these deep models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to be particularly powerful due to their ability to model sequential data. However, training RNNs remains challenging, especially as they suffer from issues like vanishing gradients and exploding activations. To address these problems, different architectures have emerged, one of which is graph-based methods that operate over the weights of the network rather than the gradients. In this work, we propose variational graph regularization (VGR), a novel technique based on graph theory, which can be applied to any recurrent neural network architecture. Our method introduces new constraints on the weight matrices of each layer that enforce similarity between neighboring layers and improve stability during backpropagation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGR through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets such as handwriting generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

"Automated anatomical labeling plays a vital role in coronary artery disease diagnosing procedure. The main challenge in this problem is the large individual variability inherited in human anatomy. Existing methods usually rely on the position information and the prior knowledge of the topology of the coronary artery tree, which may lead to unsatisfactory performance when the main branches are confusing. Motivated by the wide application of the graph neural network in structured data, in this paper, we propose a conditional partial-residual graph convolutional network (CPR-GCN), which takes both position and CT image into consideration, since CT image contains abundant information such as branch size and spanning direction. Two majority parts, a Partial-Residual GCN and a conditions extractor, are included in CPR-GCN. The conditions extractor is a hybrid model containing the 3D CNN and the LSTM, which can extract 3D spatial image features along the branches. On the technical side, the Partial-Residual GCN takes the position features of the branches, with the 3D spatial image features as conditions, to predict the label for each branches. While on the mathematical side, our approach twists the partial differential equation (PDE) into the graph modeling. A dataset with 511 subjects is collected from the clinic and annotated by two experts with a two-phase annotation process. According to the five-fold cross-validation, our CPR-GCN yields 95.8% meanRecall, 95.4% meanPrecision and 0.955 meanF1, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",0

"In traditional image classification tasks, preprocessing steps such as normalization and feature extraction can greatly impact the performance of the model. One approach that has recently gained popularity is using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their strong ability to learn robust features. However, these models often struggle with high-dimensional data which increases the risk of overfitting. To address this problem, a novel method called the tensor projection layer was introduced. This method uses a nonlinear projection matrix to map the input tensors into a lower dimensional space without losing any information required for efficient computation. The resulting projected output is then passed through the network to improve accuracy and reduce computational costs. Experimental results show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to standard methods of feature reduction such as PCA and tSNE on multiple benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits better generalization properties than competing techniques. Overall, the tensor projection layer provides a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in CNN architectures leading to more effective training and higher test accuracies.",1
"We present a prior for manifold structured data, such as surfaces of 3D shapes, where deep neural networks are adopted to reconstruct a target shape using gradient descent starting from a random initialization. We show that surfaces generated this way are smooth, with limiting behavior characterized by Gaussian processes, and we mathematically derive such properties for fully-connected as well as convolutional networks. We demonstrate our method in a variety of manifold reconstruction applications, such as point cloud denoising and interpolation, achieving considerably better results against competitive baselines while requiring no training data.

Overall, our work offers a new perspective on how to design deep learning algorithms that achieve better generalization through explicit control over the inductive biases present in the learned models.",1
"Graph-structured data arise in many scenarios. A fundamental problem is to quantify the similarities of graphs for tasks such as classification. Graph kernels are positive-semidefinite functions that decompose graphs into substructures and compare them. One problem in the effective implementation of this idea is that the substructures are not independent, which leads to high-dimensional feature space. In addition, graph kernels cannot capture the high-order complex interactions between vertices. To mitigate these two problems, we propose a framework called DeepMap to learn deep representations for graph feature maps. The learnt deep representation for a graph is a dense and low-dimensional vector that captures complex high-order interactions in a vertex neighborhood. DeepMap extends Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to arbitrary graphs by aligning vertices across graphs and building the receptive field for each vertex. We empirically validate DeepMap on various graph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.",0
"This paper presents DeepMap: a method that uses deep neural networks to learn representations on graphs that capture important features.

Our contributions include both qualitative results (visualizations) as well as quantitative improvements. This paper introduces the use of deep neural networks to learn representations of graphs. We introduce the DeepMap algorithm which leverages these deep learning models to capture complex relationships across nodes in graphs. Specifically, we apply these learned representations to the task of graph classification where our model shows significant improvement over competing approaches. In addition, we provide visualizations demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets. Overall, our work advances the state-of-art in graph representation learning while providing meaningful insights into real world applications.",1
"Object Cluster Hierarchies is a new variant of Hierarchical Cluster Analysis that gains interest in the field of Machine Learning. Being still at an early stage of development, the lack of tools for systematic analysis of Object Cluster Hierarchies inhibits its further improvement. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a generator of synthetic hierarchical data that can be used for benchmarking Object Cluster Hierarchy methods. The article presents a thorough empirical and theoretical analysis of the generator and provides guidance on how to control its parameters. Conducted experiments show the usefulness of the data generator that is capable of producing a wide range of differently structured data. Further, benchmarking datasets that mirror the most common types of hierarchies are generated and made available to the public, together with the developed generator (http://kio.pwr.edu.pl/?page\_id=396).",0
"The aim of this research is to develop a hierarchical data generator that can create datasets with varying levels of complexity to benchmark clustering methods. To achieve this goal, we propose using a tree-structured stick breaking process (TSSB) as a foundation for generating synthetic data. The TSSB approach allows us to control the level of variability within each cluster while maintaining a consistent structure across all clusters in the hierarchy. We demonstrate how our method can generate datasets with different characteristics such as number of clusters, cluster size, mixture ratio, variance, etc., making it suitable for evaluating clustering algorithms under diverse conditions. We evaluate the performance of our data generator through extensive experiments and compare it against existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our results show that the proposed method generates high-quality datasets that can effectively challenge clustering algorithms while providing meaningful insights into their strengths and limitations. This work has significant implications for advancing the field of unsupervised learning by enabling more robust evaluation of clustering algorithms and driving further innovation in this area.",1
"Vector representations of graphs and relational structures, whether hand-crafted feature vectors or learned representations, enable us to apply standard data analysis and machine learning techniques to the structures. A wide range of methods for generating such embeddings have been studied in the machine learning and knowledge representation literature. However, vector embeddings have received relatively little attention from a theoretical point of view.   Starting with a survey of embedding techniques that have been used in practice, in this paper we propose two theoretical approaches that we see as central for understanding the foundations of vector embeddings. We draw connections between the various approaches and suggest directions for future research.",0
"Title: Word2Vec, Node2Vec, Graph2Vec, X2Vec: From Scalar Fields to Complex Networks  In recent years, vector embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool in natural language processing, computer vision, and other data-driven fields. These methods transform high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional vectors while preserving essential properties such as distances and relations among elements. In particular, the popular word2vec algorithm has proven effective in capturing latent semantic structure from text corpora. Extensions of these techniques have been applied to various forms of structured data beyond plain texts, including graphs representing social networks, knowledge bases, and chemical compounds. Despite their widespread use, there remains a lack of a unified framework that encompasses all these developments under one umbrella. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art approaches to vector embeddings of structured data. We focus on four key frameworks – word2vec, node2vec, graph2vec, and X2vec – which represent increasing levels of complexity in terms of the types of data they can handle. By reviewing each approach in turn and highlighting their unique features and capabilities, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a clear understanding of how these methods work and how to choose the most appropriate technique for a given problem. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for further advancing the theory and applications of vector embeddings in different domains. Our ultimate goal is to establish a solid foundation for the development of more advanced models that can effectively capture complex relationships within and across diverse datasets.",1
"Over the past few years, we have seen fundamental breakthroughs in core problems in machine learning, largely driven by advances in deep neural networks. At the same time, the amount of data collected in a wide array of scientific domains is dramatically increasing in both size and complexity. Taken together, this suggests many exciting opportunities for deep learning applications in scientific settings. But a significant challenge to this is simply knowing where to start. The sheer breadth and diversity of different deep learning techniques makes it difficult to determine what scientific problems might be most amenable to these methods, or which specific combination of methods might offer the most promising first approach. In this survey, we focus on addressing this central issue, providing an overview of many widely used deep learning models, spanning visual, sequential and graph structured data, associated tasks and different training methods, along with techniques to use deep learning with less data and better interpret these complex models --- two central considerations for many scientific use cases. We also include overviews of the full design process, implementation tips, and links to a plethora of tutorials, research summaries and open-sourced deep learning pipelines and pretrained models, developed by the community.

"Technology and the fruition of cultural heritage are becoming increasingly more entwined, especially with the advent of smart audio guides, virtual and augmented reality, and interactive installations. Machine learning and computer vision are important components of this ongoing integration, enabling new interaction modalities between user and museum. Nonetheless, the most frequent way of interacting with paintings and statues still remains taking pictures. Yet images alone can only convey the aesthetics of the artwork, lacking is information which is often required to fully understand and appreciate it. Usually this additional knowledge comes both from the artwork itself (and therefore the image depicting it) and from an external source of knowledge, such as an information sheet. While the former can be inferred by computer vision algorithms, the latter needs more structured data to pair visual content with relevant information. Regardless of its source, this information still must be be effectively transmitted to the user. A popular emerging trend in computer vision is Visual Question Answering (VQA), in which users can interact with a neural network by posing questions in natural language and receiving answers about the visual content. We believe that this will be the evolution of smart audio guides for museum visits and simple image browsing on personal smartphones. This will turn the classic audio guide into a smart personal instructor with which the visitor can interact by asking for explanations focused on specific interests. The advantages are twofold: on the one hand the cognitive burden of the visitor will decrease, limiting the flow of information to what the user actually wants to hear; and on the other hand it proposes the most natural way of interacting with a guide, favoring engagement.",0
"Visual question answering (VQA) has been increasingly attracted attention from researchers due to its ability to provide precise answers through natural language and image data fusion. In the domain of cultural heritage, VQA can offer valuable assistance to both professionals and visitors by supplying accurate responses while providing contextual knowledge that traditional Q&A systems cannot capture. By integrating multiple sources, including text documents, images, videos and even geospatial data, this technology offers users access to diverse and detailed information. This paper presents our recent work on developing novel approaches for fine-grained visual question answering applied to different tasks within the realm of cultural heritage. We demonstrate how these methods effectively address challenges related to ambiguity, heterogeneity and scale inherent in these applications. Our results showcase the strengths of these strategies towards enhancing user experience in exploring rich multimedia archives and collections. Furthermore, we discuss potential future directions for leveraging large-scale datasets, deep learning models and collaborative filtering techniques as well as adapting existing ones for specific needs across diverse domains.",1
"We present a novel framework that can combine multi-domain learning (MDL), data imputation (DI) and multi-task learning (MTL) to improve performance for classification and regression tasks in different domains. The core of our method is an adversarial autoencoder that can: (1) learn to produce domain-invariant embeddings to reduce the difference between domains; (2) learn the data distribution for each domain and correctly perform data imputation on missing data. For MDL, we use the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the domain distributions. For DI, we use an adversarial approach where a generator fill in information for missing data and a discriminator tries to distinguish between real and imputed values. Finally, using the universal feature representation in the embeddings, we train a classifier using MTL that given input from any domain, can predict labels for all domains. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to other state-of-art methods in three distinct settings, DG-DI in image recognition with unstructured data, MTL-DI in grade estimation with structured data and MDMTL-DI in a selection process using mixed data.",0
"Machine learning has revolutionized many fields by enabling computers to learn from data without explicit programming. However, real world applications often involve multiple datasets that are diverse across domains, which hinders progress towards generalizing machine learning models. In this work we propose novel multi-domain adversarial autoencoding approach capable of both unifying different domains into one shared space while preserving their unique characteristics. Our algorithm uses two discriminators; global and local which operate at domain level and sample level respectively. These discriminators assist generator in generating coherent samples, as well as filling missing values present within each dataset. We evaluate our framework on benchmark datasets spanning various domains including image, text and tabular structured data. Experimental results show significant improvement over traditional imputation techniques as well as comparative baselines. Further ablation studies exhibit robustness and scalability of proposed model. This research can potentially enhance utility of existing applications as well as enable new possibilities such as few shot cross-domain transfer learning. Overall, our contribution addresses current limitations in developing models suitable for handling multiple diverse datasets encountered during practice in various domains.",1
"We introduce AutoGluon-Tabular, an open-source AutoML framework that requires only a single line of Python to train highly accurate machine learning models on an unprocessed tabular dataset such as a CSV file. Unlike existing AutoML frameworks that primarily focus on model/hyperparameter selection, AutoGluon-Tabular succeeds by ensembling multiple models and stacking them in multiple layers. Experiments reveal that our multi-layer combination of many models offers better use of allocated training time than seeking out the best. A second contribution is an extensive evaluation of public and commercial AutoML platforms including TPOT, H2O, AutoWEKA, auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and Google AutoML Tables. Tests on a suite of 50 classification and regression tasks from Kaggle and the OpenML AutoML Benchmark reveal that AutoGluon is faster, more robust, and much more accurate. We find that AutoGluon often even outperforms the best-in-hindsight combination of all of its competitors. In two popular Kaggle competitions, AutoGluon beat 99% of the participating data scientists after merely 4h of training on the raw data.",0
"In recent years, there has been a surge in interest in AutoML tools that can automatically select machine learning (ML) pipelines from large models spaces, while outperforming handcrafted models on novel distributions. However, despite their popularity, most existing AutoML systems have failed to address the critical problem of model interpretability. This lack of interpretability hinders understanding of how these black box models work and makes them unacceptable for use cases involving sensitive data such as healthcare records, personal finances, etc., where transparency is crucial. To address this issue, we propose AutoGluon-Tabular, which seamlessly combines the strengths of two state-of-the-art technologies - AutoGluon and Tabular-CVAE. Unlike traditional AutoML systems that rely solely on numerical features, our approach leverages structured data to achieve greater accuracy by incorporating domain knowledge into feature engineering processes. Our experiments show that AutoGluon-Tabular achieves better performance than other AutoML baselines across multiple datasets and ML tasks including regression, classification, and time series forecasting. Additionally, through ablation studies, we demonstrate that each component in AutoGluon-Tabular contributes significantly to improving robustness and accuracy. In summary, AutoGluon-Tabular provides both strong performance guarantees and interpretability, making it an ideal choice for businesses seeking reliable yet transparent solutions for automating ML pipeline development.",1
"Computing the similarity between two data points plays a vital role in many machine learning algorithms. Metric learning has the aim of learning a good metric automatically from data. Most existing studies on metric learning for tree-structured data have adopted the approach of learning the tree edit distance. However, the edit distance is not amenable for big data analysis because it incurs high computation cost. In this paper, we propose a new metric learning approach for tree-structured data with pq-grams. The pq-gram distance is a distance for ordered labeled trees, and has much lower computation cost than the tree edit distance. In order to perform metric learning based on pq-grams, we propose a new differentiable parameterized distance, weighted pq-gram distance. We also propose a way to learn the proposed distance based on Large Margin Nearest Neighbors (LMNN), which is a well-studied and practical metric learning scheme. We formulate the metric learning problem as an optimization problem and use the gradient descent technique to perform metric learning. We empirically show that the proposed approach not only achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art edit distance-based methods in various classification problems, but also solves the classification problems much more rapidly than the edit distance-based methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to metric learning using ordered labeled trees (OLT) to capture hierarchical structures in data distributions. We propose the use of pq-grams as a discriminative feature representation that captures local patterns from raw data without requiring domain knowledge or expert tuning. Our method employs a variant of batch gradient descent called sequential minibatch k-gradient descent (SMBGD), which enables efficient computation and reduces overfitting by effectively utilizing mini-batch information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple benchmark datasets, including image classification, sentiment analysis, and gene regulatory network inference tasks. Our findings suggest that OLT-based metric learning with pq-gram features can be used to effectively model complex high-dimensional data distributions and achieve improved performance on challenging machine learning problems.",1
"In this paper, we study the problem of learning Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for regression. Current architectures of GCNs are limited to the small receptive field of convolution filters and shared transformation matrix for each node. To address these limitations, we propose Semantic Graph Convolutional Networks (SemGCN), a novel neural network architecture that operates on regression tasks with graph-structured data. SemGCN learns to capture semantic information such as local and global node relationships, which is not explicitly represented in the graph. These semantic relationships can be learned through end-to-end training from the ground truth without additional supervision or hand-crafted rules. We further investigate applying SemGCN to 3D human pose regression. Our formulation is intuitive and sufficient since both 2D and 3D human poses can be represented as a structured graph encoding the relationships between joints in the skeleton of a human body. We carry out comprehensive studies to validate our method. The results prove that SemGCN outperforms state of the art while using 90% fewer parameters.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, human pose estimation remains a challenging problem due to occlusions, varying body shapes, and complex interactions within scenes. Existing methods rely on handcrafted features or recurrent architectures that can struggle to capture global dependencies. In this work, we propose semantic graph convolutional networks for human pose regression, which leverages scene contextual relationships among keypoints by modeling their dependencies through graphs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, surpassing previous methods that use conventional sequential models or graph reasoning modules. Our approach opens up new possibilities for incorporating external knowledge into deep learning frameworks, paving the way for more advanced applications in areas like virtual reality, robotics, and augmented reality.",1
"In view of the huge success of convolution neural networks (CNN) for image classification and object recognition, there have been attempts to generalize the method to general graph-structured data. One major direction is based on spectral graph theory and graph signal processing. In this paper, we study the problem from a completely different perspective, by introducing parallel flow decomposition of graphs. The essential idea is to decompose a graph into families of non-intersecting one dimensional (1D) paths, after which, we may apply a 1D CNN along each family of paths. We demonstrate that the our method, which we call GraphFlow, is able to transfer CNN architectures to general graphs. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we test our method on the classical MNIST dataset, synthetic datasets on network information propagation and a news article classification dataset.",0
"This paper presents a new graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture called GFCN which utilizes parallel flows to improve performance and efficiency over traditional GCN models. GCNs have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to capture structural information from graphs using neural networks. However, existing GCN architectures suffer from limitations such as limited scalability, computational complexity, and difficulty handling large datasets. To address these issues, we propose the use of parallel flows within our proposed model, allowing us to efficiently process large amounts of data while reducing computational costs. We demonstrate that GFCN achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets and outperforms other commonly used GCN architectures in terms of accuracy and speed. Our approach represents a significant step forward in advancing GCN technology for real-world applications.",1
"Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling structured data. However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making them infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle dynamic heterogeneous graphs, we introduce the relative temporal encoding technique into HGT, which is able to capture the dynamic structural dependency with arbitrary durations. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm---HGSampling---for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9%--21% on various downstream tasks.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized many fields and disciplines, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data structures such as graphs and trees.

To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called heterogeneous graph transformer that combines the strengths of both graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and attention mechanisms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of graph neural networks. Our proposed architecture allows us to effectively capture global dependencies while reducing computational complexity through parallelization across different layers of computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark tasks involving node classification and link prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins. Overall, our work represents an important step towards creating more efficient and accurate graph neural models capable of handling real-world applications.",1
"Neural networks for structured data like graphs have been studied extensively in recent years. To date, the bulk of research activity has focused mainly on static graphs. However, most real-world networks are dynamic since their topology tends to change over time. Predicting the evolution of dynamic graphs is a task of high significance in the area of graph mining. Despite its practical importance, the task has not been explored in depth so far, mainly due to its challenging nature. In this paper, we propose a model that predicts the evolution of dynamic graphs. Specifically, we use a graph neural network along with a recurrent architecture to capture the temporal evolution patterns of dynamic graphs. Then, we employ a generative model which predicts the topology of the graph at the next time step and constructs a graph instance that corresponds to that topology. We evaluate the proposed model on several artificial datasets following common network evolving dynamics, as well as on real-world datasets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used extensively in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, question answering, among others. In many applications, however, dynamic graphs play a crucial role where graph evolution over time plays an important part. For example, stock market analysis often relies on understanding how social networks change in response to news articles posted online, while disease prediction models can benefit from tracking the spread of illnesses through contact networks of individuals. Motivated by these applications, we present EvoNet: A novel neural network architecture that predicts how dynamic graphs evolve over time using only their current states. Our method treats each node as having a continuous state vector representation which captures both static attributes of the node and dynamic features related to changes of edges incident on them over time. We then design two separate components within our model - one responsible for learning edge dynamics conditioned solely on the initial snapshot, and another component focused on capturing self-dynamics of individual nodes. Both components interact non-linearly in order to output predictions for graph snapshots at later times. Experiments conducted across several datasets demonstrate significant improvements achieved through our approach over existing baselines. They showcase compelling accuracy gains upwards of nearly +15% when forecasting future edges over short time horizons as well as qualitative advantages in terms of predicting node attribute changes such as node degrees. Our contributions enable researchers and practitioners alike to build more accurate models of real-world systems whose behaviors can be naturally represented via dynamic graphs. By enabling better forecasts into these system properties, valuable insights become accessible through improved decision making processes across industries impacted by technology today.",1
"Learning generative models for graph-structured data is challenging because graphs are discrete, combinatorial, and the underlying data distribution is invariant to the ordering of nodes. However, most of the existing generative models for graphs are not invariant to the chosen ordering, which might lead to an undesirable bias in the learned distribution. To address this difficulty, we propose a permutation invariant approach to modeling graphs, using the recent framework of score-based generative modeling. In particular, we design a permutation equivariant, multi-channel graph neural network to model the gradient of the data distribution at the input graph (a.k.a., the score function). This permutation equivariant model of gradients implicitly defines a permutation invariant distribution for graphs. We train this graph neural network with score matching and sample from it with annealed Langevin dynamics. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the capacity of this new architecture in learning discrete graph algorithms. For graph generation, we find that our learning approach achieves better or comparable results to existing models on benchmark datasets.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for generating graphs that have permutation invariant properties. We use score-based generative modeling techniques to learn the probability distribution over possible graphs given some constraints on their structure. Our method is able to generate graphs that can capture a wide range of statistical patterns found in real-world networks while preserving symmetry under graph automorphisms. The key contributions of our work include: A new algorithm based on optimal transport theory which enables efficient learning of permutation invariant graph distributions from data; An improved scoring function to measure the quality of generated graphs that takes into account both structural similarity as well as permutation invariance properties; An empirical study showing the effectiveness of our approach across multiple applications ranging from biological network analysis to social network analysis and computer vision tasks like graph matching. Our results demonstrate the potential for using permutation invariant graphs as a powerful tool in modeling complex systems that naturally exhibit such symmetries, providing more accurate predictions and insights than traditional non-permutation invariant methods. This research paves the way towards developing new algorithms and models for analyzing large scale networks by capturing their inherent symmetric structures, ultimately leading to a better understanding of these complex phenomena.",1
"Detecting communities on graphs has received significant interest in recent literature. Current state-of-the-art community embedding approach called \textit{ComE} tackles this problem by coupling graph embedding with community detection. Considering the success of hyperbolic representations of graph-structured data in last years, an ongoing challenge is to set up a hyperbolic approach for the community detection problem. The present paper meets this challenge by introducing a Riemannian equivalent of \textit{ComE}. Our proposed approach combines hyperbolic embeddings with Riemannian K-means or Riemannian mixture models to perform community detection. We illustrate the usefulness of this framework through several experiments on real-world social networks and comparisons with \textit{ComE} and recent hyperbolic-based classification approaches.",0
"In recent years, node embedding methods have become increasingly popular as a tool for representing high-dimensional graphs in lower dimensions while preserving their structural properties. These techniques rely on the idea that graph nodes can be represented by fixed-length vectors, which capture both local and global relationships within the network. Despite their success, however, many existing approaches suffer from several limitations, including computational complexity, sensitivity to parameter choices, and difficulties in capturing hierarchical structures. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel framework called hyperbolic node embedding (HNE) that leverages non-Euclidean geometry to model complex networks more effectively. Our approach builds upon the successful hyperbolic random walk algorithm and uses a variational autoencoder architecture to learn embeddings. We demonstrate through extensive experiments across different datasets and applications that HNE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while being computationally efficient and robust to parameter settings. Furthermore, our method offers new insights into the nature of real-world networks by providing meaningful interpretations of learned embeddings. Our work opens up exciting opportunities for future research at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and physics.",1
"Graph-structured data arise ubiquitously in many application domains. A fundamental problem is to quantify their similarities. Graph kernels are often used for this purpose, which decompose graphs into substructures and compare these substructures. However, most of the existing graph kernels do not have the property of scale-adaptivity, i.e., they cannot compare graphs at multiple levels of granularities. Many real-world graphs such as molecules exhibit structure at varying levels of granularities. To tackle this problem, we propose a new graph kernel called Tree++ in this paper. At the heart of Tree++ is a graph kernel called the path-pattern graph kernel. The path-pattern graph kernel first builds a truncated BFS tree rooted at each vertex and then uses paths from the root to every vertex in the truncated BFS tree as features to represent graphs. The path-pattern graph kernel can only capture graph similarity at fine granularities. In order to capture graph similarity at coarse granularities, we incorporate a new concept called super path into it. The super path contains truncated BFS trees rooted at the vertices in a path. Our evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that Tree++ achieves the best classification accuracy compared with previous graph kernels.",0
"""Graph kernels have proven to be a powerful tool in graph analysis due to their ability to capture structural properties of graphs and enable downstream machine learning tasks such as classification and regression. In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing novel graph kernel approaches that can effectively handle large datasets while still maintaining high accuracy. This paper presents Tree++, a truncated tree based graph kernel, which addresses these challenges by leveraging a hierarchical representation of graphs using minimum spanning trees (MSTs). Our approach constructs an MST of each input graph and then recursively builds smaller subtrees by removing nodes from the MST until a certain depth is reached. These subtree representations form the basis of our graph kernel, allowing us to efficiently compute pairwise similarities between large graphs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Tree++ on both benchmark datasets and real-world applications, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, scalability, and accuracy.""",1
"Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been successfully applied to representation learning on graphs in a variety of real-world applications. However, two fundamental weaknesses of MPNNs' aggregators limit their ability to represent graph-structured data: losing the structural information of nodes in neighborhoods and lacking the ability to capture long-range dependencies in disassortative graphs. Few studies have noticed the weaknesses from different perspectives. From the observations on classical neural network and network geometry, we propose a novel geometric aggregation scheme for graph neural networks to overcome the two weaknesses. The behind basic idea is the aggregation on a graph can benefit from a continuous space underlying the graph. The proposed aggregation scheme is permutation-invariant and consists of three modules, node embedding, structural neighborhood, and bi-level aggregation. We also present an implementation of the scheme in graph convolutional networks, termed Geom-GCN (Geometric Graph Convolutional Networks), to perform transductive learning on graphs. Experimental results show the proposed Geom-GCN achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of open datasets of graphs.

"This paper presents ""Geom-GCN"", a new approach that applies graph convolutional networks (GCN) to geometric data represented as graphs. We present a unified framework incorporating both node features and geometry such as proximity and directionality into GCN. Our model takes advantage of the strengths of current GCN models which already encode local structure information well, while adding the ability to capture nonlinear relationships between nodes based on global geometric properties. Experimentally we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method against other state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised node classification tasks across various datasets. These results validate the effectiveness of using geometric information along with existing methods based solely on node attributes and edge connections. Our work opens up the possibility of applying deep learning techniques to more general types of data beyond traditional grid-based images by leveraging their underlying structures.",1
"We address the problem of merging graph and feature-space information while learning a metric from structured data. Existing algorithms tackle the problem in an asymmetric way, by either extracting vectorized summaries of the graph structure or adding hard constraints to feature-space algorithms. Following a different path, we define a metric regression scheme where we train metric-constrained linear combinations of dissimilarity matrices. The idea is that the input matrices can be pre-computed dissimilarity measures obtained from any kind of available data (e.g. node attributes or edge structure). As the model inputs are distance measures, we do not need to assume the existence of any underlying feature space. Main challenge is that metric constraints (especially positive-definiteness and sub-additivity), are not automatically respected if, for example, the coefficients of the linear combination are allowed to be negative. Both positive and sub-additive constraints are linear inequalities, but the computational complexity of imposing them scales as O(D3), where D is the size of the input matrices (i.e. the size of the data set). This becomes quickly prohibitive, even when D is relatively small. We propose a new graph-based technique for optimizing under such constraints and show that, in some cases, our approach may reduce the original computational complexity of the optimization process by one order of magnitude. Contrarily to existing methods, our scheme applies to any (possibly non-convex) metric-constrained objective function.",0
"Title: Multiple Metric Learning for Structured Data Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to learning multiple metrics jointly from structured data using variational autoencoders (VAEs). Traditionally, VAEs have been used to learn one dominant metric through their latent space. However, real world datasets often contain multiple metrics which may overlap. Our proposed method allows us to learn these overlapping metrics while preserving the underlying structure of the original dataset. We show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and benchmark datasets. The results indicate that our approach provides better clustering performance by capturing more intrinsic features than traditional models. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications of multi-metric learning such as collaborative filtering and image generation. Overall, our work extends the capabilities of unsupervised machine learning and provides new opportunities for exploring complex relationships within large scale datasets.

"While learning models are typically studied for inputs in the form of a fixed dimensional feature vector, real world data is rarely found in this form. In order to meet the basic requirement of traditional learning models, structural data generally have to be converted into fix-length vectors in a handcrafted manner, which is tedious and may even incur information loss. A common form of structured data is what we term ""semantic tree-structures"", corresponding to data where rich semantic information is encoded in a compositional manner, such as those expressed in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and eXtensible Markup Language (XML). For tree-structured data, several learning models have been studied to allow for working directly on raw tree-structure data, However such learning models are limited to either a specific tree-topology or a specific tree-structured data format, e.g., synthetic parse trees. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for end-to-end learning on generic semantic tree-structured data of arbitrary topology and heterogeneous data types, such as data expressed in JSON, XML and so on. Motivated by the works in recursive and recurrent neural networks, we develop exemplar neural implementations of our framework for the JSON format. We evaluate our approach on several UCI benchmark datasets, including ablation and data-efficiency studies, and on a toy reinforcement learning task. Experimental results suggest that our framework yields comparable performance to use of standard models with dedicated feature-vectors in general, and even exceeds baseline performance in cases where compositional nature of the data is particularly important.   The source code for a JSON-based implementation of our framework along with experiments can be downloaded at https://github.com/EndingCredits/json2vec.",0
"In this work, we propose a framework that enables end-to-end learning on semantic tree-structured data. Our approach is motivated by the observation that many real-world datasets have complex hierarchical structures which cannot be easily captured using traditional neural network architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer models.  In our framework, we represent each instance of data as a tree where nodes correspond to different levels of abstraction, from low-level details to high-level concepts. We then use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to process these trees, allowing us to capture hierarchical relationships within each tree.  We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets: (i) Treetap, a synthetic dataset designed to test how well our model can learn the structure of tree-structured data; (ii) OpenIE, a widely used benchmark task for open information extraction which involves extracting facts from textual sources; (iii) Semeval Task 8, a task aimed at measuring performance in relation classification. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines in all tasks. Furthermore, analysis shows that our framework is able to successfully capture the structure present in the data and leverage it to improve performance. Overall, our work highlights the benefits of incorporating structured representations into deep learning models, particularly when dealing with complex and hierarchically organized data.",1
"Paper documents are widely used as an irreplaceable channel of information in many fields, especially in financial industry, fostering a great amount of demand for systems which can convert document images into structured data representations.

"This paper proposes a machine learning framework for data ingestion from document images. The proposed approach involves preprocessing techniques such as image cropping, normalization, and enhancement to improve the quality of the input images. Next, feature extraction methods like Fourier descriptors, Zernike moments, and textural features are used to extract relevant features from the images. These extracted features are then fed into machine learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest algorithms to classify and recognize patterns in the document images. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high accuracy and efficiency in detecting and recognizing different types of documents including IDs, checks, receipts, etc., making it suitable for various real-world applications such as automation of financial transactions, customer onboarding processes, and record management systems.",1
"Machine learning models that can exploit the inherent structure in data have gained prominence. In particular, there is a surge in deep learning solutions for graph-structured data, due to its wide-spread applicability in several fields. Graph attention networks (GAT), a recent addition to the broad class of feature learning models in graphs, utilizes the attention mechanism to efficiently learn continuous vector representations for semi-supervised learning problems. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of GAT models, and present interesting insights into their behavior. In particular, we show that the models are vulnerable to heterogeneous rogue nodes and hence propose novel regularization strategies to improve the robustness of GAT models. Using benchmark datasets, we demonstrate performance improvements on semi-supervised learning, using the proposed robust variant of GAT.",0
"This paper presents A Regularized Attention Mechanism (RAM) that regularizes attention mechanisms commonly used in Graph Attention Networks (GAT). RAM adds two terms to the standard GAT self-attention function: one that ensures each node attends to different regions in a graph, rather than focusing on similar nodes; another that assigns high values to attended nodes rather than spreading all weights uniformly across them. Experimental results show improvements over prior approaches on several benchmark datasets, including Pubmed, Freebase25K, Reddit, and Diffbot. We also provide analyses showing how RAM influences learned attention patterns. Code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance. This research proposes a new method called Regularized Attention Mechanism (RAM), which modifies traditional attention mechanisms utilised in Graph Attention Networks (GAT). By adding novel mathematical functions, the authors aimed to enhance the performance of these models by improving their ability to focus on diverse parts of graphs instead of homogenous nodes, as well as increasing the weight assigned to significant nodes rather than distributing them evenly among less important ones. Experiments conducted using four distinct datasets –Pubmed, Freebase25K, Reddit, and Diffbot– demonstrated improved outcomes compared to preexisting methods. Further analysis was carried out to explore how RAM affects the learning process. These findings may lead to future optimisations of GAN algorithms and related systems. Supplementary materials, including code and data sets, will be available once published.",1
"Despite the phenomenal success of deep neural networks in a broad range of learning tasks, there is a lack of theory to understand the way they work. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to perform much better than Fully-Connected Networks (FCNs) on spatially structured data: the architectural structure of CNNs benefits from prior knowledge on the features of the data, for instance their translation invariance. The aim of this work is to understand this fact through the lens of dynamics in the loss landscape.   We introduce a method that maps a CNN to its equivalent FCN (denoted as eFCN). Such an embedding enables the comparison of CNN and FCN training dynamics directly in the FCN space. We use this method to test a new training protocol, which consists in training a CNN, embedding it to FCN space at a certain ``relax time'', then resuming the training in FCN space. We observe that for all relax times, the deviation from the CNN subspace is small, and the final performance reached by the eFCN is higher than that reachable by a standard FCN of same architecture. More surprisingly, for some intermediate relax times, the eFCN outperforms the CNN it stemmed, by combining the prior information of the CNN and the expressivity of the FCN in a complementary way. The practical interest of our protocol is limited by the very large size of the highly sparse eFCN. However, it offers interesting insights into the persistence of architectural bias under stochastic gradient dynamics. It shows the existence of some rare basins in the FCN loss landscape associated with very good generalization. These can only be accessed thanks to the CNN prior, which helps navigate the landscape during the early stages of optimization.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. One key component of many successful deep learning models is convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite their popularity, however, CNNs still face significant challenges in terms of computational efficiency and interpretability. As datasets continue to grow larger and more complex, these issues become even more pronounced.  This paper explores how architecture design choices can play a crucial role in addressing some of these limitations while improving overall model performance. We focus specifically on two techniques commonly used in convolutional architectures: spatial pyramid pooling and dilated convolutions. These methods offer several advantages over traditional approaches. For example, they allow the network to capture features at multiple scales without significantly increasing computational cost. They also reduce the impact of boundary effects on feature extraction, which helps improve image quality and accuracy. Finally, these techniques often lead to more efficient representations that require fewer parameters to achieve comparable results. By incorporating these principles into our proposed architecture, we demonstrate that carefully designed convolutional frameworks can indeed find ""needles"" in large haystacks quickly and accurately - ultimately leading to better overall system behavior. While there remain important unanswered questions related to generalization under distribution shift and other factors, architectural innovations like those here promise to keep advancing the cutting edge.",1
"The richness in the content of various information networks such as social networks and communication networks provides the unprecedented potential for learning high-quality expressive representations without external supervision. This paper investigates how to preserve and extract the abundant information from graph-structured data into embedding space in an unsupervised manner. To this end, we propose a novel concept, Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), to measure the correlation between input graphs and high-level hidden representations. GMI generalizes the idea of conventional mutual information computations from vector space to the graph domain where measuring mutual information from two aspects of node features and topological structure is indispensable. GMI exhibits several benefits: First, it is invariant to the isomorphic transformation of input graphs---an inevitable constraint in many existing graph representation learning algorithms; Besides, it can be efficiently estimated and maximized by current mutual information estimation methods such as MINE; Finally, our theoretical analysis confirms its correctness and rationality. With the aid of GMI, we develop an unsupervised learning model trained by maximizing GMI between the input and output of a graph neural encoder. Considerable experiments on transductive as well as inductive node classification and link prediction demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, and even sometimes exceeds the performance of supervised ones.",0
"Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach to graph representation learning that maximizes mutual information (MI) between node representations and their corresponding class labels. Our method leverages the intuition behind MI as a measure of similarity between two distributions, where high MI implies strong association between them. To achieve this goal, we first map each input graph into a probability distribution over node features using a neural network. We then minimize the negative log likelihood of these feature embeddings with respect to the ground truth labels. By doing so, our model learns representations that capture both structural and semantic information within the data, ultimately leading to improved performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework compared against several state-of-the-art baselines.",1
"Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC) is a powerful model to efficiently represent multi-dimensional, structured data such as images. The simplest solution to solve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent layer-wise subproblems. However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest inter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory, which adds top-down connections between consecutive layers. In this study, a new model called 2-Layers Sparse Predictive Coding (2L-SPC) is introduced to assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the 2L-SPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a sequence of independent Lasso layers. The 2L-SPC and the 2-layers Hi-La networks are trained on 4 different databases and with different sparsity parameters on each layer. First, we show that the overall prediction error generated by 2L-SPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers prediction error between layers. Second, we demonstrate that the inference stage of the 2L-SPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model. Third, we show that the 2L-SPC also accelerates the learning process. Finally, the qualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation probability, show that the 2L-SPC features are more generic and informative.",0
"The study investigates the effectiveness of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a modeling tool for hierarchical sparse coding. The authors aim to address some limitations of existing methods by incorporating top-down connections that allow feedback from higher levels of abstraction to influence lower level representations. Their findings show that including top-down connections significantly improves performance on both simulated and real-world datasets compared to traditional bottom-up models. This suggests that integrating these types of constraints can lead to more robust and efficient algorithms for tasks such as object recognition and image compression. Overall, the results highlight the potential of ANNs for representing complex patterns in data while offering insights into how different connection schemes affect their operation.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been shown to work effectively for modeling graph structured data to solve tasks such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. There has been some recent progress in defining the notion of pooling in graphs whereby the model tries to generate a graph level representation by downsampling and summarizing the information present in the nodes. Existing pooling methods either fail to effectively capture the graph substructure or do not easily scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose ASAP (Adaptive Structure Aware Pooling), a sparse and differentiable pooling method that addresses the limitations of previous graph pooling architectures. ASAP utilizes a novel self-attention network along with a modified GNN formulation to capture the importance of each node in a given graph. It also learns a sparse soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer to effectively pool the subgraphs to form the pooled graph. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and theoretical analysis, we motivate our choice of the components used in ASAP. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN architectures with ASAP leads to state-of-the-art results on multiple graph classification benchmarks. ASAP has an average improvement of 4%, compared to current sparse hierarchical state-of-the-art method.",0
"In recent years, graph representation learning has become increasingly important in many areas of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and computer vision.

Our method allows for more effective capturing of hierarchies present in real data while also improving the robustness of node embeddings across datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark tasks and show that ASAP outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in developing powerful yet flexible tools for graph representation learning.",1
"Classifiers built with neural networks handle large-scale high dimensional data, such as facial images from computer vision, extremely well while traditional statistical methods often fail miserably. In this paper, we attempt to understand this empirical success in high dimensional classification by deriving the convergence rates of excess risk. In particular, a teacher-student framework is proposed that assumes the Bayes classifier to be expressed as ReLU neural networks. In this setup, we obtain a sharp rate of convergence, i.e., $\tilde{O}_d(n^{-2/3})$, for classifiers trained using either 0-1 loss or hinge loss. This rate can be further improved to $\tilde{O}_d(n^{-1})$ when the data distribution is separable. Here, $n$ denotes the sample size. An interesting observation is that the data dimension only contributes to the $\log(n)$ term in the above rates. This may provide one theoretical explanation for the empirical successes of deep neural networks in high dimensional classification, particularly for structured data.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep neural network classifiers have become very popular due to their ability to learn complex representations from large amounts of data. However, understanding the generalization performance of these models remains challenging. One of the main difficulties lies in quantifying how fast such classifiers converge to the true risk minimizer as more training data becomes available. This work studies the convergence behavior of several widely used deep neural network architectures including ResNet, VGG, and AlexNet on CIFAR-10, SVHN, ImageNet datasets by considering different ways of generating pseudo label based teacher student framework . Our results show that sharp rates of convergence can indeed occur for certain architectures, and we establish bounds on the rate at which this occurs under mild assumptions. Furthermore ,our methodology allows us to identify architectures where this type of convergence is less likely to hold and thus may benefit from additional regularization techniques . Overall ,this study provides insights into the fundamental nature of overfitting versus underfitting and helps to develop more robust deep learning algorithms",1
"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been shown to be quite successful in modeling graph-structured data. However, the primary focus has been on handling simple undirected graphs. Multi-relational graphs are a more general and prevalent form of graphs where each edge has a label and direction associated with it. Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representations of nodes only. In this paper, we propose CompGCN, a novel Graph Convolutional framework which jointly embeds both nodes and relations in a relational graph. CompGCN leverages a variety of entity-relation composition operations from Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques and scales with the number of relations. It also generalizes several of the existing multi-relational GCN methods. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, and achieve demonstrably superior results. We make the source code of CompGCN available to foster reproducible research.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its early days as a novelty technology used only by researchers and enthusiasts. Today, AI permeates every aspect of society, from personal devices like smartphones and virtual assistants, to businesses that use machine learning algorithms to automate processes and gain insights into consumer behavior. One area where AI continues to make significant advances is in computer vision, which focuses on teaching machines how to interpret visual data such as images and videos. In particular, graph convolutional networks have emerged as a powerful tool for processing multi-relational graphs, which are ubiquitous in many real-world applications ranging from bioinformatics to social network analysis. These models leverage graph structures and learn nonlinear node representations directly from raw input data, making them well suited for handling complex interdependencies among variables.  In recent years, several variations of graph convolutional networks have been proposed, each addressing specific shortcomings of their predecessors. For instance, some methods rely heavily on strong supervision signals during training while others utilize graph pooling layers that can cause information loss and reduce accuracy. Meanwhile, other approaches require careful preprocessing of graph inputs, limiting their applicability to new datasets without extensive tuning. Despite these advancements, there remains a need for more flexible and efficient solutions capable of tackling diverse tasks across multiple domains. To this end, we introduce composition-based multi-relational graph convolutional networks (MGNNs), which integrate graph composition operations within standard neural network architectures to achieve improved performance while maintaining simplicity and scalability. Our experiments demonstrate that MGNNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines on several benchmark datasets, offering evidence of their effectiveness in handling complex relationships among nodes.

"We propose a novel spectral convolutional neural network (CNN) model on graph structured data, namely Distributed Feedback-Looped Networks (DFNets). This model is incorporated with a robust class of spectral graph filters, called feedback-looped filters, to provide better localization on vertices, while still attaining fast convergence and linear memory requirements. Theoretically, feedback-looped filters can guarantee convergence w.r.t. a specified error bound, and be applied universally to any graph without knowing its structure. Furthermore, the propagation rule of this model can diversify features from the preceding layers to produce strong gradient flows. We have evaluated our model using two benchmark tasks: semi-supervised document classification on citation networks and semi-supervised entity classification on a knowledge graph. The experimental results show that our model considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both benchmark tasks over all datasets.",0
"Deep learning approaches have become very popular for processing graph data due to their ability to effectively encode structural information.

Recently, adaptive filtering methods have been proposed as a solution, but they can still struggle with capturing high frequency features. In this paper, we introduce DFNets, which combine deep feature normalization with feedback-looped spectral filters to address these limitations. Our approach significantly improves both model capacity and computational efficiency by allowing each filter to learn its own spectrum based on local neighborhood information. We show that DFNet outperforms existing methods across several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for processing complex graph structures.",1

"Kernel classifiers and regressors designed for structured data, such as sequences, trees and graphs, have significantly advanced a number of interdisciplinary areas such as computational biology and drug design. Typically, kernels are designed beforehand for a data type which either exploit statistics of the structures or make use of probabilistic generative models, and then a discriminative classifier is learned based on the kernels via convex optimization. However, such an elegant two-stage approach also limited kernel methods from scaling up to millions of data points, and exploiting discriminative information to learn feature representations.   We propose, structure2vec, an effective and scalable approach for structured data representation based on the idea of embedding latent variable models into feature spaces, and learning such feature spaces using discriminative information. Interestingly, structure2vec extracts features by performing a sequence of function mappings in a way similar to graphical model inference procedures, such as mean field and belief propagation. In applications involving millions of data points, we showed that structure2vec runs 2 times faster, produces models which are $10,000$ times smaller, while at the same time achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance.",0

"Semantic segmentation with deep learning has achieved great progress in classifying the pixels in the image. However, the local location information is usually ignored in the high-level feature extraction by the deep learning, which is important for image semantic segmentation.

Firstly, the image grid data is extended to graph structure data by a convolutional network, which transforms the semantic segmentation problem into a graph node classification problem. Then we apply graph convolutional network to solve this graph node classification problem. As far as we know, it is the first time that we apply the graph convolutional network in image semantic segmentation.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize deep neural networks to graph-structured data, have drawn considerable attention and achieved state-of-the-art performance in numerous graph related tasks. However, existing GNN models mainly focus on designing graph convolution operations. The graph pooling (or downsampling) operations, that play an important role in learning hierarchical representations, are usually overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel graph pooling operator, called Hierarchical Graph Pooling with Structure Learning (HGP-SL), which can be integrated into various graph neural network architectures. HGP-SL incorporates graph pooling and structure learning into a unified module to generate hierarchical representations of graphs. More specifically, the graph pooling operation adaptively selects a subset of nodes to form an induced subgraph for the subsequent layers. To preserve the integrity of graph's topological information, we further introduce a structure learning mechanism to learn a refined graph structure for the pooled graph at each layer.

In this work, we aim to investigate how robust GNNs are to different types of structural noise present in real-world graphs. We evaluate the effectiveness of three popular benchmarking datasets under various levels of synthetic noise generated using four common noise strategies. Our experiments reveal that GNNs exhibit varying degrees of resilience across datasets and noise conditions. In particular, we find that increasing connectivity density increases noise tolerance overall but decreases the impact of certain types of noise, while other properties such as degree distribution play less significant roles.

"In the last decade, many diverse advances have occurred in the field of information extraction from data. Information extraction in its simplest form takes place in computing environments, where structured data can be extracted through a series of queries. The continuous expansion of quantities of data have therefore provided an opportunity for knowledge extraction (KE) from a textual document (TD). A typical problem of this kind is the extraction of common characteristics and knowledge from a group of TDs, with the possibility to group such similar TDs in a process known as clustering. In this paper we present a technique for such KE among a group of TDs related to the common characteristics and meaning of their content. Our technique is based on the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC), for which the conducted experiments have proven to be comprehensive measure to achieve a high-quality KE.",0
"This article presents a methodology for measuring similarity in textual data using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. With advances in natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, there has been growing interest in analyzing large amounts of unstructured data such as documents, articles, social media posts, etc., to extract meaningful insights from them. In many cases, the analysis involves comparing two sets of texts, where one set may represent a baseline dataset, another set represents the current topic under investigation, or multiple datasets are compared against each other. To perform effective comparisons and draw conclusions based on these analyses, having a reliable measure of similarity between textual datasets becomes critical. Existing measures of similarity used in literature have limitations that make them ill-suited for measuring similarity in textual data. We demonstrate how to use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as a measure of similarity in textual data by first converting the datasets into numerical vectors and then applying the rank correlation coefficient. Our experiments show that this method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.",1
"The (variational) graph auto-encoder and its variants have been popularly used for representation learning on graph-structured data. While the encoder is often a powerful graph convolutional network, the decoder reconstructs the graph structure by only considering two nodes at a time, thus ignoring possible interactions among edges. On the other hand, structured prediction, which considers the whole graph simultaneously, is computationally expensive. In this paper, we utilize the well-known triadic closure property which is exhibited in many real-world networks. We propose the triad decoder, which considers and predicts the three edges involved in a local triad together. The triad decoder can be readily used in any graph-based auto-encoder. In particular, we incorporate this to the (variational) graph auto-encoder. Experiments on link prediction, node clustering and graph generation show that the use of triads leads to more accurate prediction, clustering and better preservation of the graph characteristics.",0

In contrast to typical pooling operators, SAN allows to embed a given set of features to a vector representation of arbitrary size. We show that by adjusting the size of embedding, SAN is capable of preserving the whole information from the input.

"Title: ""Set Aggregation Networks: Adaptive Fusion through Task-Specific Pooling"" Authors: Xiaodong He, Zhe Cao, Jianping Shi  Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable successes across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, designing effective convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remains challenging due to the complex interplay among network architecture, data preprocessing, optimization, and evaluation metrics. This paper introduces Set Aggregation Networks (SAN), which provide a flexible framework that generalizes popular pooling operations in CNNs as task-specific adaptive fusion. SAN models learn a trainable weight matrix to encode channel relationships into each feature map. We show that the learned weights effectively capture spatial correlations and yield superior performance over standard methods on various benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that SAN can significantly improve the tradeoff between computational efficiency and representation capacity by adjusting model complexity during training. Our findings highlight the benefits of enabling fine-grained control over the information aggregation process within CNNs, providing valuable insights towards more effective designs of these ubiquitous models. Overall, we believe this work offers promising opportunities for advancing deep learning research in diverse areas.",1
"The current paper is a study in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), motivated by the lack of examples simple enough so that they can be thoroughly understood theoretically, but complex enough to be realistic. We constructed an example of structured data, motivated by problems from image-to-text conversion (OCR), which requires long-term memory to decode. Our data is a simple writing system, encoding characters 'X' and 'O' as their upper halves, which is possible due to symmetry of the two characters. The characters can be connected, as in some languages using cursive, such as Arabic (abjad). The string 'XOOXXO' may be encoded as '${\vee}{\wedge}\kern-1.5pt{\wedge}{\vee}\kern-1.5pt{\vee}{\wedge}$'. It follows that we may need to know arbitrarily long past to decode a current character, thus requiring long-term memory. Subsequently we constructed an RNN capable of decoding sequences encoded in this manner. Rather than by training, we constructed our RNN ""by inspection"", i.e. we guessed its weights. This involved a sequence of steps. We wrote a conventional program which decodes the sequences as the example above. Subsequently, we interpreted the program as a neural network (the only example of this kind known to us). Finally, we generalized this neural network to discover a new RNN architecture whose instance is our handcrafted RNN. It turns out to be a 3 layer network, where the middle layer is capable of performing simple logical inferences; thus the name ""deductron"".

We demonstrate that Deductron can solve challenging reasoning puzzles by leveraging both sequential memory and deep learning principles. Our work explores novel techniques for integrating deduction rules into RNN architectures, using data augmentation strategies tailored specifically to logical inference problems. Experiments show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines across multiple benchmark datasets, indicating the effectiveness of combining deductive reasoning with end-to-end machine learning models.",1
"Adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Identifying potential DDIs during the drug design process is critical for patients and society. Although several computational models have been proposed for DDI prediction, there are still limitations: (1) specialized design of drug representation for DDI predictions is lacking; (2) predictions are based on limited labelled data and do not generalize well to unseen drugs or DDIs; and (3) models are characterized by a large number of parameters, thus are hard to interpret. In this work, we develop a ChemicAl SubstrucTurE Representation (CASTER) framework that predicts DDIs given chemical structures of drugs.CASTER aims to mitigate these limitations via (1) a sequential pattern mining module rooted in the DDI mechanism to efficiently characterize functional sub-structures of drugs; (2) an auto-encoding module that leverages both labelled and unlabelled chemical structure data to improve predictive accuracy and generalizability; and (3) a dictionary learning module that explains the prediction via a small set of coefficients which measure the relevance of each input sub-structures to the DDI outcome. We evaluated CASTER on two real-world DDI datasets and showed that it performed better than state-of-the-art baselines and provided interpretable predictions.",0
"Caster (CAtchment SEarch Tool) can predict potential drug interactions by identifying overlapping chemical substructures present within different molecules. While current drug interaction prediction methods rely heavily on similarity searching techniques based on fingerprints and pharmacophores, our approach utilizes chemical substructure representation as the primary search key. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through rigorous testing against standard benchmark datasets, achieving better performance than existing state-of-the-art systems. Additionally, we discuss future directions for expanding the scope of Caster beyond just drug interactions, including the possibility of using this tool to aid in drug discovery and design processes. Overall, Caster represents a significant advancement in the field of computational chemistry and has the potential to make important contributions towards improving human health outcomes.",1
"Healthcare data continues to flourish yet a relatively small portion, mostly structured, is being utilized effectively for predicting clinical outcomes. The rich subjective information available in unstructured clinical notes can possibly facilitate higher discrimination but tends to be under-utilized in mortality prediction. This work attempts to assess the gain in performance when multiple notes that have been minimally preprocessed are used as an input for prediction. A hierarchical architecture consisting of both convolutional and recurrent layers is used to concurrently model the different notes compiled in an individual hospital stay. This approach is evaluated on predicting in-hospital mortality on the MIMIC-III dataset. On comparison to approaches utilizing structured data, it achieved higher metrics despite requiring less cleaning and preprocessing. This demonstrates the potential of unstructured data in enhancing mortality prediction and signifies the need to incorporate more raw unstructured data into current clinical prediction methods.",0
"Medical care providers often rely on laboratory results and structured medical records to make diagnostic and treatment decisions. However, these sources may not provide sufficient information to predict patient outcomes. Clinical notes can offer valuable insights into patients’ health status, but current methods lack sufficient precision to accurately estimate patient survival times based solely on their content. This study aimed to develop machine learning algorithms capable of analyzing unstructured textual data from electronic health records (EHRs) to assess patient morbidity and mortality risk. We utilized a large dataset containing EHR data linked to patient demographics and death certificates, which allowed us to train models using deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By fine-tuning pre-trained language models like GPT-2, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance in predictive accuracy while exhibiting high interpretability. Ultimately, the proposed framework could aid clinicians in identifying at-risk individuals earlier and improving the effectiveness of personalized medicine efforts. Furthermore, given its generalizability across various populations, the approach shows promise for becoming a key component in future precision health initiatives.",1
"The scattering transform is a multilayered wavelet-based deep learning architecture that acts as a model of convolutional neural networks. Recently, several works have introduced generalizations of the scattering transform for non-Euclidean settings such as graphs. Our work builds upon these constructions by introducing windowed and non-windowed graph scattering transforms based upon a very general class of asymmetric wavelets. We show that these asymmetric graph scattering transforms have many of the same theoretical guarantees as their symmetric counterparts. This work helps bridge the gap between scattering and other graph neural networks by introducing a large family of networks with provable stability and invariance guarantees. This lays the groundwork for future deep learning architectures for graph-structured data that have learned filters and also provably have desirable theoretical properties.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained popularity due to their ability to model complex graph data structures such as social networks, citation graphs, protein interaction graphs, etc., in which each node can represent one entity and each edge represents some form of relation between those entities. However, traditional GNN architectures suffer from limitations related to oversmoothing, lack of robustness, and difficulty in training deep models. In this paper, we introduce asymmetric geometric scattering transforms (AGST), which allow us to design new GNN architectures that overcome these challenges by incorporating advanced mathematical tools from representation theory, harmonic analysis, and computer graphics. AGST allows for more efficient parameterization of graph convolution kernels and enables powerful regularizers to control network capacity while reducing overfitting. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, stability, interpretability, and scalability. This work paves the way towards a better understanding of GNNs and their use in real-world applications involving large-scale graph structured data.",1
"GAN is a deep-learning based generative approach to generate contents such as images, languages and speeches. Recently, studies have shown that GAN can also be applied to generative adversarial attack examples to fool the machine-learning models. In comparison with the previous non-learning adversarial example attack approaches, the GAN-based adversarial attack example approach can generate the adversarial samples quickly using the GAN architecture every time facing a new sample after training, but meanwhile needs to perturb the attack samples in great quantities, which results in the unpractical application in reality. To address this issue, we propose a new approach, named Few-Feature-Attack-GAN (FFA-GAN). FFA-GAN has a significant time-consuming advantage than the non-learning adversarial samples approaches and a better non-zero-features performance than the GANbased adversarial sample approaches. FFA-GAN can automatically generate the attack samples in the black-box attack through the GAN architecture instead of the evolutional algorithms or the other non-learning approaches. Besides, we introduce the mask mechanism into the generator network of the GAN architecture to optimize the constraint issue, which can also be regarded as the sparsity problem of the important features. During the training, the different weights of losses of the generator are set in the different training phases to ensure the divergence of the two above mentioned parallel networks of the generator. Experiments are made respectively on the structured data sets KDD-Cup 1999 and CIC-IDS 2017, in which the dimensions of the data are relatively low, and also on the unstructured data sets MNIST and CIFAR-10 with the data of the relatively high dimensions. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach.",0
"In general, we consider few features attacks to generate adversarial examples that can fool machine learning models. We focus on developing such attacks based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, we propose attack approaches utilizing mask functions to control regions where different objectives contribute during training. To improve model robustness under our attacks, we offer three types of defenses: retraining the model using transformed data; enhancing models' discriminators; and adding regularization terms. For all these defense methods, we provide insights into why they work based on analysis of the generated adversarial examples, as well as detailed evaluations across multiple datasets and tasks demonstrating their effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions lead to improved resilience for machine learning models against realistically occurring adversaries, making them more suitable for widespread deployment. Finally, our approach provides further evidence towards understanding the limits of existing techniques designed to defend against adversarial perturbation attacks and highlights challenges remaining in designing effective mitigation strategies.",1
"Human action recognition from skeleton data, fueled by the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), has attracted lots of attention, due to its powerful capability of modeling non-Euclidean structure data. However, many existing GCN methods provide a pre-defined graph and fix it through the entire network, which can loss implicit joint correlations. Besides, the mainstream spectral GCN is approximated by one-order hop, thus higher-order connections are not well involved. Therefore, huge efforts are required to explore a better GCN architecture. To address these problems, we turn to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and propose the first automatically designed GCN for skeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, we enrich the search space by providing multiple dynamic graph modules after fully exploring the spatial-temporal correlations between nodes. Besides, we introduce multiple-hop modules and expect to break the limitation of representational capacity caused by one-order approximation. Moreover, a sampling- and memory-efficient evolution strategy is proposed to search an optimal architecture for this task. The resulted architecture proves the effectiveness of the higher-order approximation and the dynamic graph modeling mechanism with temporal interactions, which is barely discussed before. To evaluate the performance of the searched model, we conduct extensive experiments on two very large scaled datasets and the results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art results.",0
"In this work we propose learning graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on top of skeleton data representations for human action recognition. Our approach involves applying GCN operations directly onto edge-weighted graphs constructed from skeleton sequences. We use randomized search over possible hyperparameter settings to learn optimal models, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among methods that do not require additional input modalities like RGB video frames. Importantly, our approach is efficient enough for realtime operation and can run at 64 frames per second using consumer hardware. By contrast, many recent state-of-the-art methods rely upon expensive computation involving larger datasets or more powerful GPUs. Thus, our results highlight the effectiveness of jointly designing learning architectures and optimizing their parameters through automated means across a wide range of problem domains. We plan to explore transferring knowledge gained here into other fields where complex relational reasoning abilities may prove advantageous, including natural language processing or even game playing agents.  -- Would you recommend reading the paper associated with the given abstract? -- I think so!

"Machine learning on graph structured data has attracted much research interest due to its ubiquity in real world data. However, how to efficiently represent graph data in a general way is still an open problem. Traditional methods use handcraft graph features in a tabular form but suffer from the defects of domain expertise requirement and information loss. Graph representation learning overcomes these defects by automatically learning the continuous representations from graph structures, but they require abundant training labels, which are often hard to fulfill for graph-level prediction problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, if available, the domain expertise used for designing handcraft graph features can improve the graph-level representation learning when training labels are scarce. Specifically, we proposed a multi-task knowledge distillation method. By incorporating network-theory-based graph metrics as auxiliary tasks, we show on both synthetic and real datasets that the proposed multi-task learning method can improve the prediction performance of the original learning task, especially when the training data size is small.",0
"Learning graph representations has gained increasing attention due to their wide range of applications across many domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics and finance.

In this work we focus on multi-scale graph learning and propose two novel methods using knowledge distillation from pre-trained models. Our first method utilizes self-supervised pre-training, while our second method uses semi-supervised fine-tuning using multi-source annotations. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by applying them to four benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that both proposed methods yield consistent performance improvement over several baselines. These improvements open up new possibilities for graph representation learning in the broader community.",1
"Deep generative priors offer powerful models for complex-structured data, such as images, audio, and text. Using these priors in inverse problems typically requires estimating the input and/or hidden signals in a multi-layer deep neural network from observation of its output. While these approaches have been successful in practice, rigorous performance analysis is complicated by the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problems. This paper presents a novel algorithm, Multi-Layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (ML-VAMP), for inference in multi-layer stochastic neural networks. ML-VAMP can be configured to compute maximum a priori (MAP) or approximate minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimates for these networks. We show that the performance of ML-VAMP can be exactly predicted in a certain high-dimensional random limit. Furthermore, under certain conditions, ML-VAMP yields estimates that achieve the minimum (i.e., Bayes-optimal) MSE as predicted by the replica method. In this way, ML-VAMP provides a computationally efficient method for multi-layer inference with an exact performance characterization and testable conditions for optimality in the large-system limit.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to inference in high dimensions using deep generative priors. We demonstrate that by leveraging recent advances in deep learning, we can improve upon traditional methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Our method uses a neural network to learn a deep generative model of the data distribution which can then be used to perform Bayesian inference. By doing so, we achieve better sampling efficiency and faster convergence compared to MCMC simulation. Furthermore, our method allows for automatic regularization through the use of a sparsity prior on the weights of the neural network. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MCMC techniques across a variety of challenging problems in high dimensions.",1
"Some recent studies have suggested using GANs for numeric data generation such as to generate data for completing the imbalanced numeric data. Considering the significant difference between the dimensions of the numeric data and images, as well as the strong correlations between features of numeric data, the conventional GANs normally face an overfitting problem, consequently leads to an ill-conditioning problem in generating numeric and structured data. This paper studies the constrained network structures between generator G and discriminator D in WGAN, designs several structures including isomorphic, mirror and self-symmetric structures. We evaluates the performances of the constrained WGANs in data augmentations, taking the non-constrained GANs and WGANs as the baselines. Experiments prove the constrained structures have been improved in 17/20 groups of experiments. In twenty experiments on four UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets, Australian Credit Approval data, German Credit data, Pima Indians Diabetes data and SPECT heart data facing five conventional classifiers. Especially, Isomorphic WGAN is the best in 15/20 experiments. Finally, we theoretically proves that the effectiveness of constrained structures by the directed graphic model (DGM) analysis.",0
"This study investigates the effectiveness of using constrained network structures for training generative adversarial networks (WGANs) on numeric data generation tasks. We compare performance metrics such as FID scores across different network architectures, including those with and without explicit regularization terms.

"We introduce an improved unsupervised clustering protocol specially suited for large-scale structured data. The protocol follows three steps: a dimensionality reduction of the data, a density estimation over the low dimensional representation of the data, and a final segmentation of the density landscape. For the dimensionality reduction step we introduce a parallelized implementation of the well-known t-Stochastic Neighbouring Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm that significantly alleviates some inherent limitations, while improving its suitability for large datasets. We also introduce a new adaptive Kernel Density Estimation particularly coupled with the t-SNE framework in order to get accurate density estimates out of the embedded data, and a variant of the rainfalling watershed algorithm to identify clusters within the density landscape. The whole mapping protocol is wrapped in the bigMap R package, together with visualization and analysis tools to ease the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the clustering.",0
"Title: Large Scale Visualization Techniques Using Big Data Clustering Algorithms and t-SNE Embedding  Abstract: Big data visualization has become increasingly important as large datasets continue to grow and require efficient analysis techniques. In order to effectively analyze these complex datasets, researchers often utilize clustering algorithms that group similar elements together based on shared characteristics. Additionally, dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can be used to map high-dimensional data onto lower dimensions while retaining relevant features. However, traditional mapping techniques may struggle to scale up to larger datasets due to their reliance on serial computing. To address this issue, we propose the use of parallel computing to accelerate large scale data mapping using the popular technique of t-SNE embedding. Our approach relies on distributing the computation across multiple cores and GPUs in parallel, allowing for faster processing times without compromising accuracy. We evaluate our method using several real world datasets from diverse domains, including image classification, biology, neuroscience, text analysis and recommender systems, demonstrating significant speed ups and scalability improvements. By leveraging advanced computational resources, our framework enables interactive exploration of massive datasets through intuitive scatter plots, providing new insights into the underlying structure of the data. Overall, our work offers a valuable tool for practitioners working with big data and sets a foundation for future advancements in parallelized data mapping.",1
"We propose and analyze a method for semi-supervised learning from partially-labeled network-structured data. Our approach is based on a graph signal recovery interpretation under a clustering hypothesis that labels of data points belonging to the same well-connected subset (cluster) are similar valued. This lends naturally to learning the labels by total variation (TV) minimization, which we solve by applying a recently proposed primal-dual method for non-smooth convex optimization. The resulting algorithm allows for a highly scalable implementation using message passing over the underlying empirical graph, which renders the algorithm suitable for big data applications. By applying tools of compressed sensing, we derive a sufficient condition on the underlying network structure such that TV minimization recovers clusters in the empirical graph of the data. In particular, we show that the proposed primal-dual method amounts to maximizing network flows over the empirical graph of the dataset. Moreover, the learning accuracy of the proposed algorithm is linked to the set of network flows between data points having known labels. The effectiveness and scalability of our approach is verified by numerical experiments.",0

"We consider a family of problems that are concerned about making predictions for the majority of unlabeled, graph-structured data samples based on a small proportion of labeled samples. Relational information among the data samples, often encoded in the graph/network structure, is shown to be helpful for these semi-supervised learning tasks. However, conventional graph-based regularization methods and recent graph neural networks do not fully leverage the interrelations between the features, the graph, and the labels. In this work, we propose a flexible generative framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning, which approaches the joint distribution of the node features, labels, and the graph structure. Borrowing insights from random graph models in network science literature, this joint distribution can be instantiated using various distribution families. For the inference of missing labels, we exploit recent advances of scalable variational inference techniques to approximate the Bayesian posterior. We conduct thorough experiments on benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning. Results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art models in most settings.",0
"This abstract presents our new graph-based semi-supervised learning framework that uses flexibly defined graphs to model complex relationships among data points. Our method builds on prior work by introducing multiple flexible layers into the graph construction process.

By leveraging these multi-layered connections, we can improve performance across a variety of tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and other machine learning domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Overall, our framework provides a powerful tool for tackling challenging problems in semisupervised learning where standard methods fall short.",1
"In recent years there has been a rapid increase in classification methods on graph structured data. Both in graph kernels and graph neural networks, one of the implicit assumptions of successful state-of-the-art models was that incorporating graph isomorphism features into the architecture leads to better empirical performance. However, as we discover in this work, commonly used data sets for graph classification have repeating instances which cause the problem of isomorphism bias, i.e. artificially increasing the accuracy of the models by memorizing target information from the training set. This prevents fair competition of the algorithms and raises a question of the validity of the obtained results. We analyze 54 data sets, previously extensively used for graph-related tasks, on the existence of isomorphism bias, give a set of recommendations to machine learning practitioners to properly set up their models, and open source new data sets for the future experiments.",0
"Title: Understanding Isomorphism Bias in Graph Data Sets ---------------------------------------------------------- In recent years, graph data sets have become increasingly popular due to their ability to represent complex relationships between objects. However, working with such data can lead to issues related to isomorphism bias - a phenomenon where similar structures are treated as equivalent even if they arise from different sources. This paper seeks to deepen our understanding of isomorphism bias by examining its causes, consequences, and potential solutions. We begin by analyzing how graph representations can obscure underlying structure and introduce opportunities for bias. Next, we present case studies that illustrate the impacts of isomorphism bias on downstream applications ranging from social network analysis to scientific discovery. Finally, we discuss strategies for mitigating isomorphism bias through techniques like normalization, contextualization, and visualization. By exploring these concepts and providing concrete examples, we aim to support researchers in making informed choices when working with graph data sets.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a topic of intense research recently due to their powerful capability in high-dimensional classification and regression tasks for graph-structured data. However, as GNNs typically define the graph convolution by the orthonormal basis for the graph Laplacian, they suffer from high computational cost when the graph size is large. This paper introduces Haar basis which is a sparse and localized orthonormal system for a coarse-grained chain on graph. The graph convolution under Haar basis, called Haar convolution, can be defined accordingly for GNNs. The sparsity and locality of the Haar basis allow Fast Haar Transforms (FHTs) on graph, by which a fast evaluation of Haar convolution between graph data and filters can be achieved. We conduct experiments on GNNs equipped with Haar convolution, which demonstrates state-of-the-art results on graph-based regression and node classification tasks.",0
"This paper presents an efficient method for applying Haar transforms on graphs using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Haar transforms are mathematical operations that allow for quick feature extraction from data, but have been traditionally limited to grid-based representations like images. GNNs enable learning on graph-structured data by iteratively updating node features based on their neighborhood information. By combining these two concepts, we can effectively perform high-quality feature extraction on complex, non-grid data represented as graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines across multiple tasks and datasets. Our results show significant improvements over existing methods, validating the utility of fast Haar transformations for graph neural networks. Overall, our work expands the range of applicability of the Haar transform beyond traditional image processing, providing a powerful tool for understanding and manipulating complex graph structures.",1
"Graph structured data are abundant in the real world. Among different graph types, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are of particular interest to machine learning researchers, as many machine learning models are realized as computations on DAGs, including neural networks and Bayesian networks. In this paper, we study deep generative models for DAGs, and propose a novel DAG variational autoencoder (D-VAE). To encode DAGs into the latent space, we leverage graph neural networks. We propose an asynchronous message passing scheme that allows encoding the computations on DAGs, rather than using existing simultaneous message passing schemes to encode local graph structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DVAE through two tasks: neural architecture search and Bayesian network structure learning. Experiments show that our model not only generates novel and valid DAGs, but also produces a smooth latent space that facilitates searching for DAGs with better performance through Bayesian optimization.",0

"Development of metrics for structural data-generating mechanisms is fundamental in machine learning and the related fields. In this paper, we give a general framework to construct metrics on random nonlinear dynamical systems, defined with the Perron-Frobenius operators in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vvRKHSs). We employ vvRKHSs to design mathematically manageable metrics and also to introduce operator-valued kernels, which enables us to handle randomness in systems. Our metric provides an extension of the existing metrics for deterministic systems, and gives a specification of the kernel maximal mean discrepancy of random processes. Moreover, by considering the time-wise independence of random processes, we clarify a connection between our metric and the independence criteria with kernels such as Hilbert-Schmidt independence criteria. We empirically illustrate our metric with synthetic data, and evaluate it in the context of the independence test for random processes. We also evaluate the performance with real time seris datas via clusering tasks.",0
"In the study of random dynamical systems, metric considerations play a crucial role due to their ability to characterize various properties such as stability, sensitivity, mixing, ergodicity, etc. These metrics can be expressed through reproducing kernels which allow one to associate infinite dimensional spaces of functions with feature maps obtained from sampled data. This work focuses on vector valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and the development of appropriate metrics that account for both the randomness in the system dynamics and the multi-dimensional nature of the state variables. We propose two new classes of metrics: The first is based on a novel regularized estimate of the Gram matrix while the second employs distances between RKHS embeddings of the distribution of initial conditions. By leveraging these metrics we aim at providing insights into nonlinear stochastic evolutions governed by high-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Furthermore, our analysis highlights interesting connections between Lyapunov exponents, decay rates of correlations, and spectral norms of operators acting on tensor product spaces. Our findings showcase how these metrics yield valuable perspectives into complex dynamic systems under uncertainty. As a consequence, they hold great potential to impact numerous applications where real world measurements contend with intrinsic variability. Ultimately, this research represents a step forward towards developing principled frameworks for studying and designing robust controllers within challenging uncertain contexts.",1
"Convolutional neural networks are nowadays witnessing a major success in different pattern recognition problems. These learning models were basically designed to handle vectorial data such as images but their extension to non-vectorial and semi-structured data (namely graphs with variable sizes, topology, etc.) remains a major challenge, though a few interesting solutions are currently emerging. In this paper, we introduce MLGCN; a novel spectral Multi-Laplacian Graph Convolutional Network. The main contribution of this method resides in a new design principle that learns graph-laplacians as convex combinations of other elementary laplacians each one dedicated to a particular topology of the input graphs. We also introduce a novel pooling operator, on graphs, that proceeds in two steps: context-dependent node expansion is achieved, followed by a global average pooling; the strength of this two-step process resides in its ability to preserve the discrimination power of nodes while achieving permutation invariance.

"Data samples collected for training machine learning models are typically assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid). Recent research has demonstrated that this assumption can be problematic as it simplifies the manifold of structured data. This has motivated different research areas such as data poisoning, model improvement, and explanation of machine learning models. In this work, we study the influence of a sample on determining the intrinsic topological features of its underlying manifold. We propose the Shapley Homology framework, which provides a quantitative metric for the influence of a sample of the homology of a simplicial complex. By interpreting the influence as a probability measure, we further define an entropy which reflects the complexity of the data manifold. Our empirical studies show that when using the 0-dimensional homology, on neighboring graphs, samples with higher influence scores have more impact on the accuracy of neural networks for determining the graph connectivity and on several regular grammars whose higher entropy values imply more difficulty in being learned.",0

Overall, our work represents a significant advancement towards understanding black box models and holds promising applications in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing.",1
"Efforts are underway to study ways via which the power of deep neural networks can be extended to non-standard data types such as structured data (e.g., graphs) or manifold-valued data (e.g., unit vectors or special matrices). Often, sizable empirical improvements are possible when the geometry of such data spaces are incorporated into the design of the model, architecture, and the algorithms. Motivated by neuroimaging applications, we study formulations where the data are {\em sequential manifold-valued measurements}. This case is common in brain imaging, where the samples correspond to symmetric positive definite matrices or orientation distribution functions. Instead of a recurrent model which poses computational/technical issues, and inspired by recent results showing the viability of dilated convolutional models for sequence prediction, we develop a dilated convolutional neural network architecture for this task. On the technical side, we show how the modules needed in our network can be derived while explicitly taking the Riemannian manifold structure into account. We show how the operations needed can leverage known results for calculating the weighted Fr\'{e}chet Mean (wFM). Finally, we present scientific results for group difference analysis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where the groups are derived using AD pathology load: here the model finds several brain fiber bundles that are related to AD even when the subjects are all still cognitively healthy.",0
"Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have emerged as powerful models for processing sequential data such as speech signals or video frames. However, most previous studies on CNN architectures assume that each time step produces only one scalar output, whereas many applications generate multi-dimensional outputs at every stage. This paper presents a novel architecture called dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN), which effectively captures spatial dependencies in manifold-valued sequences by utilizing dilated convolution kernels. Our DCNN model applies multiple dilations with different rates at every layer, allowing for flexible capture of temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce several strategies to mitigate overfitting due to increased model complexity. We evaluate our method using three challenging datasets: synthetic trajectories from randomly moving agents, American Sign Language videos, and speech sounds from TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetics Continuous Speech Database. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable improvement compared to baseline methods. In addition, our DCNN outperforms other recent deep learning approaches on all three tasks, proving its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional sequential data. Our code can be found online to facilitate future research.",1
"In this paper, we propose Continuous Graph Flow, a generative continuous flow based method that aims to model complex distributions of graph-structured data. Once learned, the model can be applied to an arbitrary graph, defining a probability density over the random variables represented by the graph. It is formulated as an ordinary differential equation system with shared and reusable functions that operate over the graphs. This leads to a new type of neural graph message passing scheme that performs continuous message passing over time. This class of models offers several advantages: a flexible representation that can generalize to variable data dimensions; ability to model dependencies in complex data distributions; reversible and memory-efficient; and exact and efficient computation of the likelihood of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a diverse set of generation tasks across different domains: graph generation, image puzzle generation, and layout generation from scene graphs. Our proposed model achieves significantly better performance compared to state-of-the-art models.",0
"Graphs have been widely studied from a static perspective, but more recently continuous graphs have gained interest as they can capture evolution over time. In fact, many real world systems naturally fall into this framework: communication networks evolve due to node additions/removals; social interactions form dynamic graphs as friendships change over time; biological neurons change their connections throughout life. Continuous graph signals lie at the core of capturing these dynamics, where traditional signal processing methods may fail since classical Fourier analysis no longer applies directly on them. We propose a new framework that generalizes graph filtering techniques to the continuous case by focusing on analyzing the flow instead of the signal itself. By leveraging ideas rooted in both graph theory and geometric mechanics we formalize a notion of differentiability adapted to such nonlinear structures. This enables us to develop a novel set of filter equations encompassing static graph counterparts like the popular Chebyshev and Butterworth filters, while achieving better performance than classical Euler discretization schemes. Applications to problems related to consensus and opinion formation, spread of diseases, and data assimilation validate our approach across several domains. Finally, we analyze convergence rates under specific conditions for first order flows (Lie groups). Overall, we provide a versatile toolkit applicable in numerous fields dealing with continuous graph signals, paving the road towards addressing otherwise intractable problems.",1
"Processing an input signal that contains arbitrary structures, e.g., superpixels and point clouds, remains a big challenge in computer vision. Linear diffusion, an effective model for image processing, has been recently integrated with deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose to learn pairwise relations among data points in a global fashion to improve semantic segmentation with arbitrarily-structured data, through spatial generalized propagation networks (SGPN). The network propagates information on a group of graphs, which represent the arbitrarily-structured data, through a learned, linear diffusion process. The module is flexible to be embedded and jointly trained with many types of networks, e.g., CNNs. We experiment with semantic segmentation networks, where we use our propagation module to jointly train on different data -- images, superpixels and point clouds. We show that SGPN consistently improves the performance of both pixel and point cloud segmentation, compared to networks that do not contain this module. Our method suggests an effective way to model the global pairwise relations for arbitrarily-structured data.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to deep learning called ""Learning Propagation for Arbitrarily-Structured Data"" (LPASD). LPASD is designed to handle complex datasets that may have multiple levels of structure, such as images with text annotations or multi-table relational databases.  Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with handling data from different modalities and at different scales, leading to lower performance than desired. In contrast, LPASD uses a two-step process where the model first learns to generate synthetic training examples before fine-tuning on real data. This allows the model to learn more quickly and achieve better results, even when dealing with incomplete or noisy data.  The effectiveness of LPASD is demonstrated through experiments on several benchmark datasets across diverse domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and knowledge representation. Results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the promise of LPASD for tackling challenging problems involving arbitrarily-structured data.  Overall, LPASD offers a powerful tool for addressing many real-world applications that involve complex data structures, paving the way for further advances in artificial intelligence and related fields.",1
"Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank.",0
"In recent years, pathological image analysis has become increasingly important due to its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision making. However, accurately annotating these images requires significant time and effort from human experts, which can limit their availability and lead to inconsistencies in annotation quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that combines multimodal representation learning with multi-task prediction to automatically predict biobank metadata for histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). Our method leverages multiple modalities such as image patches, embedding features, and textual descriptions of tissue samples obtained from different sources, including clinical records and digital slides. By utilizing multitask learning, our model learns to jointly predict several distinct tasks related to the biobank metadata, allowing us to leverage valuable side information during training. We demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, achieving high levels of accuracy across multiple tasks. Overall, our work represents an important step towards automating WSI annotations by developing robust representations capable of capturing critical relationships among diverse data modalities.",1
"Machine learning and deep learning have gained popularity and achieved immense success in Drug discovery in recent decades. Historically, machine learning and deep learning models were trained on either structural data or chemical properties by separated model. In this study, we proposed an architecture training simultaneously both type of data in order to improve the overall performance. Given the molecular structure in the form of SMILES notation and their label, we generated the SMILES-based feature matrix and molecular descriptors. These data were trained on a deep learning model which was also integrated with the Attention mechanism to facilitate training and interpreting. Experiments showed that our model could raise the performance of prediction comparing to the reference. With the maximum MCC 0.58 and AUC 90% by cross-validation on EGFR inhibitors dataset, our architecture was outperforming the referring model. We also successfully integrated Attention mechanism into our model, which helped to interpret the contribution of chemical structures on bioactivity.",0
"This paper presents a deep learning architecture that utilizes multiple input types to predict biological activity, specifically targeting the prediction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor activities. Our proposed approach leverages attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different inputs and improve model performance on imbalanced datasets.

Our experimental results show that our attention-based multi-input deep learning architecture outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that incorporating diverse sources of data can enhance biological activity predictions. Overall, these findings hold significant implications for drug discovery research, where accurate predictions of pharmacological properties could greatly benefit from more advanced machine learning methods.",1
"Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) are generalizations of CNNs to graph-structured data, in which convolution is guided by the graph topology. In many cases where graphs are unavailable, existing methods manually construct graphs or learn task-driven adaptive graphs. In this paper, we propose Graph Learning Neural Networks (GLNNs), which exploit the optimization of graphs (the adjacency matrix in particular) from both data and tasks. Leveraging on spectral graph theory, we propose the objective of graph learning from a sparsity constraint, properties of a valid adjacency matrix as well as a graph Laplacian regularizer via maximum a posteriori estimation. The optimization objective is then integrated into the loss function of the GCNN, which adapts the graph topology to not only labels of a specific task but also the input data. Experimental results show that our proposed GLNN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches over widely adopted social network datasets and citation network datasets for semi-supervised classification.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models that can effectively handle large amounts of unlabelled data while still achieving high levels of accuracy on supervised tasks. One approach that has gained popularity is semi-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. However, traditional SSL methods often assume a fixed graph structure, which may not capture complex relationships between nodes in the network. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method called structure-adaptive graph learning (SAGL) for robust SSL. Our algorithm utilizes an adaptive graph regularization term to update the edge weights in real-time during training. By doing so, SAGL is able to learn more accurate and informative connections among nodes, resulting in improved model performance on several benchmark datasets. We evaluate our method against state-of-the art baselines and show that SAGL consistently outperforms them across a wide range of settings. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive graphs in SSL and highlight the potential applications of SAGL in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing where handling large amounts of unlabeled data is critical.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNN) has been successfully applied to operate on the graph-structured data. Given a specific scenario, rich human expertise and tremendous laborious trials are usually required to identify a suitable GNN architecture. It is because the performance of a GNN architecture is significantly affected by the choice of graph convolution components, such as aggregate function and hidden dimension. Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown its potential in discovering effective deep architectures for learning tasks in image and language modeling. However, existing NAS algorithms cannot be directly applied to the GNN search problem. First, the search space of GNN is different from the ones in existing NAS work. Second, the representation learning capacity of GNN architecture changes obviously with slight architecture modifications. It affects the search efficiency of traditional search methods. Third, widely used techniques in NAS such as parameter sharing might become unstable in GNN.   To bridge the gap, we propose the automated graph neural networks (AGNN) framework, which aims to find an optimal GNN architecture within a predefined search space. A reinforcement learning based controller is designed to greedily validate architectures via small steps. AGNN has a novel parameter sharing strategy that enables homogeneous architectures to share parameters, based on a carefully-designed homogeneity definition. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GNN architecture identified by AGNN achieves the best performance, comparing with existing handcrafted models and tradistional search methods.",0
"Effectively leveraging graph neural networks (GNN) requires identifying appropriate architectures that can accurately capture complex relationships within the given data.

We build upon existing gradient-based optimization methods while introducing novel regularization techniques that maintain stability during training and prevent overfitting. Our approach significantly outperforms existing handcrafted GNN models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework in discovering high-quality, automatic GNN architectures. By providing a general method for uncovering optimal GNN architectures from raw input graphs, Auto-GNN enables more efficient use of computational resources and drives further progress in areas reliant on these technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, and knowledge representation.",1
The paper discusses a pooling mechanism to induce subsampling in graph structured data and introduces it as a component of a graph convolutional neural network. The pooling mechanism builds on the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of a matrix representing node adjacency and node similarity as adaptively obtained through the vertices embedding learned by the model. Such mechanism is applied to obtain an incrementally coarser graph where nodes are adaptively pooled into communities based on the outcomes of the non-negative factorization. The empirical analysis on graph classification benchmarks shows how such coarsening process yields significant improvements in the predictive performance of the model with respect to its non-pooled counterpart.,0
"In recent years, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning on graph data structures such as social network graphs and biological knowledge graphs. However, these models often struggle with overfitting due to their deep architecture and limited capacity. To tackle this issue, many techniques have been proposed to simplify the structure of the input graph before feeding it into GCNNs. One popular technique is called ""node pooling"", which involves aggregating nodes from different partitions of the graph into mini-batches to reduce computation costs while preserving important features.  This work proposes a novel non-negative factorization approach to node pooling in GCNNs. By leveraging the latent structure of the graph represented by decompositions such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), our method can efficiently capture both local and global dependencies within the network. We show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art pooling methods on several benchmark datasets across multiple metrics including accuracy and clustering coefficient recovery. Further, we demonstrate how our approach can improve robustness against adversarial attacks by applying our method to real world large scale social network data sets. Our results indicate that incorporating the SVD decomposition can provide significant improvements to performance under certain types of attack where edge modification is the primary mechanism used to poison or manipulate edges within the graph. Overall, this study provides insights into new ways to leverage matrix decomposition based algorithms in the development of more resilient machine learning systems for graph structured data",1
"Learning graph-structured data with graph neural networks (GNNs) has been recently emerging as an important field because of its wide applicability in bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, social network analysis and data mining. Recent GNN algorithms are based on neural message passing, which enables GNNs to integrate local structures and node features recursively. However, past GNN algorithms based on 1-hop neighborhood neural message passing are exposed to a risk of loss of information on local structures and relationships. In this paper, we propose Neighborhood Edge AggregatoR (NEAR), a novel framework that aggregates relations between the nodes in the neighborhood via edges. NEAR, which can be orthogonally combined with previous GNN algorithms, gives integrated information that describes which nodes in the neighborhood are connected. Therefore, GNNs combined with NEAR reflect each node's local structure beyond the nodes themselves. Experimental results on multiple graph classification tasks show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results.",0
"Here we describe a model that uses graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on graphs where the vertices are labeled as either positive or negative examples. Our approach, called ""NEAR,"" builds upon previous work by training two separate models on neighborhood aggregates generated from the original graph using different edge weight functions. This allows us to capture both local features present near each vertex, as well as global properties like connectedness and clustering coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results across many tasks including node classification, link prediction, and anomaly detection. Further analysis shows that the predictions made by our algorithm can often reveal important structural insights into the underlying networks themselves. All code used in experiments is open source and available online. Overall, these results suggest that NEAR represents a powerful new tool for working with complex network data, with potential applications in fields ranging from social science to engineering to computer security.",1
"Existing deep learning models may encounter great challenges in handling graph structured data. In this paper, we introduce a new deep learning model for graph data specifically, namely the deep loopy neural network. Significantly different from the previous deep models, inside the deep loopy neural network, there exist a large number of loops created by the extensive connections among nodes in the input graph data, which makes model learning an infeasible task. To resolve such a problem, in this paper, we will introduce a new learning algorithm for the deep loopy neural network specifically. Instead of learning the model variables based on the original model, in the proposed learning algorithm, errors will be back-propagated through the edges in a group of extracted spanning trees. Extensive numerical experiments have been done on several real-world graph datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the learning algorithm in handling graph data.",0
"This paper proposes the Deep Loopy Neural Network (DLNN) model which aims at improving graph structured data representation learning by incorporating loop structures into neural networks. The main contribution of DLNN lies in three aspects: i) a deep neural network framework that is able to capture multiple loops within graphs; ii) two types of loop structures implemented with different activation functions to enforce non-linearity; iii) a novel training method called loop backpropagation where each layer takes responsibility only for one full loop at most, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on node classification demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly across datasets from four domains, including social media, citation networks, biology and protein structures. Meanwhile, case studies verify our analysis of model interpretability and validity through visualizing the learned representations via t-SNE and UMAP techniques respectively. Our findings suggest DLNN as a promising solution to boost the performance of graph structured data representation learning.",1
"Non-linear kernel methods can be approximated by fast linear ones using suitable explicit feature maps allowing their application to large scale problems. We investigate how convolution kernels for structured data are composed from base kernels and construct corresponding feature maps. On this basis we propose exact and approximative feature maps for widely used graph kernels based on the kernel trick. We analyze for which kernels and graph properties computation by explicit feature maps is feasible and actually more efficient. In particular, we derive approximative, explicit feature maps for state-of-the-art kernels supporting real-valued attributes including the GraphHopper and graph invariant kernels. In extensive experiments we show that our approaches often achieve a classification accuracy close to the exact methods based on the kernel trick, but require only a fraction of their running time. Moreover, we propose and analyze algorithms for computing random walk, shortest-path and subgraph matching kernels by explicit and implicit feature maps. Our theoretical results are confirmed experimentally by observing a phase transition when comparing running time with respect to label diversity, walk lengths and subgraph size, respectively.",0
"In recent years, graph kernels have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing structured data such as graphs and trees. These kernels can capture complex relationships between objects by representing them as graphs and computing similarities between their topological structures. However, existing graph kernel methods suffer from limitations in terms of scalability and interpretability due to their reliance on explicit feature maps that extract handcrafted features from input graphs. On the other extreme, implicit feature maps have been shown to achieve better performance but lack interpretability because they learn features directly from raw inputs without any human intervention.  In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges the gap between explicit and implicit feature maps of graph kernels. Our approach relies on meta learning which enables us to train models that can learn to generalize across different types of tasks and datasets. We demonstrate how our method improves upon state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets while providing interpretable insights into the characteristics of input graphs. Further analysis shows that our method learns high quality features that closely align with human intuition, making it applicable to real world applications where interpretation and explainability play crucial roles. Overall, our study provides new perspectives on designing more effective graph kernels with improved performance and transparency.",1
"Many machine learning models can be attacked with adversarial examples, i.e. inputs close to correctly classified examples that are classified incorrectly. However, most research on adversarial attacks to date is limited to vectorial data, in particular image data. In this contribution, we extend the field by introducing adversarial edit attacks for tree-structured data with potential applications in medicine and automated program analysis. Our approach solely relies on the tree edit distance and a logarithmic number of black-box queries to the attacked classifier without any need for gradient information. We evaluate our approach on two programming and two biomedical data sets and show that many established tree classifiers, like tree-kernel-SVMs and recursive neural networks, can be attacked effectively.",0
"Abstract: In many applications including natural language processing and computer vision, tree structures serve as a compact representation of data that can facilitate efficient computation. However, these trees are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where slight modifications can lead to incorrect outputs without being detectable by humans or existing defenses such as integral robustness (e.g., distance bounds) checks. We propose two novel methods termed NaryAttack and MultiTargetAttack to generate such adversarial edit attacks on trees. For example, we show that using NaryAttack one can modify up to half of the edges in a dependency parse tree such that a pretrained model produces any target string among all possible dependencies while maintaining high semantic similarity scores over unmodified substructures. Motivated by human feedback analysis and our evaluations against models trained via reinforcement learning from human preferences, we further show that most adversarial edits remain imperceptible even after multiple rounds of inspection aimed at detecting them; thus, they pose serious threats to applications relying on black-box prediction quality measures. Our work highlights the limitations of current metrics used in practice and encourages future research toward more comprehensive evaluation of machine learning systems based on structured representations.",1
"Recent works reveal that network embedding techniques enable many machine learning models to handle diverse downstream tasks on graph structured data. However, as previous methods usually focus on learning embeddings for a single network, they can not learn representations transferable on multiple networks. Hence, it is important to design a network embedding algorithm that supports downstream model transferring on different networks, known as domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptive Network Embedding framework, which applies graph convolutional network to learn transferable embeddings. In DANE, nodes from multiple networks are encoded to vectors via a shared set of learnable parameters so that the vectors share an aligned embedding space. The distribution of embeddings on different networks are further aligned by adversarial learning regularization. In addition, DANE's advantage in learning transferable network embedding can be guaranteed theoretically. Extensive experiments reflect that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art network embedding baselines in cross-network domain adaptation tasks.",0
"In recent years, domain adaptation has emerged as a key challenge in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, and question answering that involve different domains or contexts. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel method called Domain Adaptive Network Embedding (DANE) which can effectively learn domain-specific representations by aligning distributions across multiple sources. Our approach first extracts sentence embeddings using pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, or ALBERT on source data, then adapts them to target domains through adversarial training with a discriminator network. We evaluate our model against several strong baselines on several benchmark datasets from diverse NLP tasks and show consistent improvements over existing methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of DANE at solving complex domain adaptation problems while maintaining high performance.",1
Kernels for structured data are commonly obtained by decomposing objects into their parts and adding up the similarities between all pairs of parts measured by a base kernel. Assignment kernels are based on an optimal bijection between the parts and have proven to be an effective alternative to the established convolution kernels. We explore how the base kernel can be learned as part of the classification problem. We build on the theory of valid assignment kernels derived from hierarchies defined on the parts. We show that the weights of this hierarchy can be optimized via multiple kernel learning. We apply this result to learn vertex similarities for the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graph classification. We present first experimental results which demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.,0
"In recent years, graph kernel methods have become increasingly popular due to their ability to capture structural information in graphs through various mathematical techniques. Among these methods, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test has been shown to be particularly effective in characterizing graphs, especially those that exhibit some form of nonlinearity or hierarchy. However, there remains a challenge in designing assignment kernels based on WL tests that can properly capture complex graph structures while remaining computationally tractable.  This work addresses this issue by introducing deep Weisfeiler-Lehman assignment kernels (dWLAKs), which are defined as linear combinations of multiple kernels learned from different levels of the WL hierarchy. By leveraging techniques from machine learning, we demonstrate how multiple kernel learning can effectively select appropriate features at each level of the hierarchy and integrate them into a unified representation that captures complex graph patterns. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis of our proposed dWLAK methodology, showing that it admits desirable properties such as positive definiteness and symmetry.  We evaluate our approach using extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art graph kernel methods, both in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining deep representations derived from the WL hierarchy with multiple kernel learning in tackling challenging graph mining tasks.  Overall, this study represents an important step toward developing more powerful graph kernel methods capable of handling complex real-world data sets. The development of efficient yet expressive graph descriptors holds great potential in many fields, including computer vision, bioinformatics, social network analysis, and natural language processing. With further advancements along these lines, we expect to see even more exciting applications emerge i",1
"The recent proliferation of publicly available graph-structured data has sparked an interest in machine learning algorithms for graph data. Since most traditional machine learning algorithms assume data to be tabular, embedding algorithms for mapping graph data to real-valued vector spaces has become an active area of research. Existing graph embedding approaches are based purely on structural information and ignore any semantic information from the underlying domain. In this paper, we demonstrate that semantic information can play a useful role in computing graph embeddings. Specifically, we present a framework for devising embedding strategies aware of domain-specific interpretations of graph nodes and edges, and use knowledge of downstream machine learning tasks to identify relevant graph substructures. Using two real-life domains, we show that our framework yields embeddings that are simple to implement and yet achieve equal or greater accuracy in machine learning tasks compared to domain independent approaches.",0
"Graph node embeddings have become increasingly important in recent years due to their ability to capture structural information from large networks such as social media platforms, online communities, and biological systems. In particular, domain-aware random walks (RWs) have proven to be effective at generating high quality embeddings that captures both local and global properties of graphs while preserving their intrinsic structure. However, one major challenge with existing methods is ensuring fairness across different domains by taking into account contextual biases present within each graph. This work presents a novel methodology called Domain-Aware Biased RW (DBRW), which addresses these limitations and offers improved performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our proposed approach achieves this goal through a combination of targeted random walk exploration and efficient bias estimation techniques. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and robustness under varying conditions. Overall, DBRW provides researchers with a powerful toolkit for generating high quality graph node embeddings with enhanced domain awareness.",1
"In this paper we propose Structuring AutoEncoders (SAE). SAEs are neural networks which learn a low dimensional representation of data which are additionally enriched with a desired structure in this low dimensional space. While traditional Autoencoders have proven to structure data naturally they fail to discover semantic structure that is hard to recognize in the raw data. The SAE solves the problem by enhancing a traditional Autoencoder using weak supervision to form a structured latent space. In the experiments we demonstrate, that the structured latent space allows for a much more efficient data representation for further tasks such as classification for sparsely labeled data, an efficient choice of data to label, and morphing between classes. To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we show experiments on the benchmark image datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, DeepFashion2 and on a dataset of 3D human shapes.",0
"Autoencoders have proven to be effective tools in deep learning applications such as image compression and generation, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

We explore how these structures impact the performance of autoencoders on different tasks and evaluate their effectiveness compared to unstructured autoencoders. Our results show that structured autoencoders can significantly improve model performance, particularly in tasks involving generating high quality images and recovering lost data. Additionally, we highlight some limitations of current structured autoencoder models and provide suggestions for future research directions in this area. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential benefits of using structured autoencoders for deep learning applications and contributes to the growing body of literature on this topic.",1
"Architectures for sparse hierarchical representation learning have recently been proposed for graph-structured data, but so far assume the absence of edge features in the graph. We close this gap and propose a method to pool graphs with edge features, inspired by the hierarchical nature of chemistry. In particular, we introduce two types of pooling layers compatible with an edge-feature graph-convolutional architecture and investigate their performance for molecules relevant to drug discovery on a set of two classification and two regression benchmark datasets of MoleculeNet. We find that our models significantly outperform previous benchmarks on three of the datasets and reach state-of-the-art results on the fourth benchmark, with pooling improving performance for three out of four tasks, keeping performance stable on the fourth task, and generally speeding up the training process.",0
"In recent years, machine learning has been applied successfully to solve problems in fields such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, these models often require large amounts of data and computational resources which can make them difficult to use in applications where such resources may be limited, such as drug discovery. Molecular graph theory offers the potential for efficient and accurate modeling of complex chemical structures but traditional machine learning approaches struggle with their intrinsically high dimensionality and sparsity. This work addresses this challenge by proposing a new method based on sparse hierarchical representation (SHR) of molecules in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By leveraging both global and local structural features through a hierarchy of subgraphs we can achieve state-of-the art performance on several benchmark datasets while requiring substantially less training data than other methods. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying deep learning techniques to molecular design tasks under constraints on data availability and computation cost.",1
"Neural networks have many successful applications, while much less theoretical understanding has been gained. Towards bridging this gap, we study the problem of learning a two-layer overparameterized ReLU neural network for multi-class classification via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) from random initialization. In the overparameterized setting, when the data comes from mixtures of well-separated distributions, we prove that SGD learns a network with a small generalization error, albeit the network has enough capacity to fit arbitrary labels. Furthermore, the analysis provides interesting insights into several aspects of learning neural networks and can be verified based on empirical studies on synthetic data and on the MNIST dataset.",0
"This paper presents a study of overparameterized neural networks trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on structured data.

We investigate the use of SGD, which has proven effective in handling high-dimensional datasets and achieving faster convergence rates compared to batch gradient descent methods. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of utilizing structured prior knowledge in model development by incorporating domain-specific constraints into the optimization process. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained through our proposed method achieve superior performance in comparison to those trained without structural guidance and existing state-of-the-art approaches in related tasks. Overall, our findings contribute towards understanding how to effectively train complex deep learning architectures, particularly in cases where large amounts of labeled data may not be available.",1
"Many common sequential data sources, such as source code and natural language, have a natural tree-structured representation. These trees can be generated by fitting a sequence to a grammar, yielding a hierarchical ordering of the tokens in the sequence. This structure encodes a high degree of syntactic information, making it ideal for problems such as grammar correction. However, little work has been done to develop neural networks that can operate on and exploit tree-structured data. In this paper we present the Tree-Transformer \textemdash{} a novel neural network architecture designed to translate between arbitrary input and output trees. We applied this architecture to correction tasks in both the source code and natural language domains. On source code, our model achieved an improvement of $25\%$ $\text{F}0.5$ over the best sequential method. On natural language, we achieved comparable results to the most complex state of the art systems, obtaining a $10\%$ improvement in recall on the CoNLL 2014 benchmark and the highest to date $\text{F}0.5$ score on the AESW benchmark of $50.43$.",0

We hope that our approach can help improve the reliability and quality of large-scale applications dealing with structured data repositories.",1
"Graph structured data provide two-fold information: graph structures and node attributes. Numerous graph-based algorithms rely on both information to achieve success in supervised tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. However, node attributes could be missing or incomplete, which significantly deteriorates the performance. The task of node attribute generation aims to generate attributes for those nodes whose attributes are completely unobserved. This task benefits many real-world problems like profiling, node classification and graph data augmentation. To tackle this task, we propose a deep adversarial learning based method to generate node attributes; called node attribute neural generator (NANG). NANG learns a unifying latent representation which is shared by both node attributes and graph structures and can be translated to different modalities. We thus use this latent representation as a bridge to convert information from one modality to another. We further introduce practical applications to quantify the performance of node attribute generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets and the empirical results show that node attributes generated by the proposed method are high-qualitative and beneficial to other applications. The datasets and codes are available online.",0
"This paper presents new algorithms that solve both problems. We begin by presenting a novel algorithm for generating node attributes on graphs. This algorithm allows users to specify any desired attribute distribution, and then assigns those distributions randomly to nodes while preserving their structure (such as clusters) as closely as possible. Second, we show how these node attributes can be used to guide graph visualization. Specifically, we use node color to represent one such attribute, and demonstrate several techniques for choosing colors based on different criteria. Finally, we evaluate our approach through several case studies, demonstrating that it leads to more informative and effective visualizations than previous methods. Our work has important implications for network analysis and visualization across many domains, including social science, biology, computer systems, and beyond.",1
"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a class of general models that can learn from graph structured data. Despite being general, GCNs are admittedly inferior to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when applied to vision tasks, mainly due to the lack of domain knowledge that is hardcoded into CNNs, such as spatially oriented translation invariant filters. However, a great advantage of GCNs is the ability to work on irregular inputs, such as superpixels of images. This could significantly reduce the computational cost of image reasoning tasks. Another key advantage inherent to GCNs is the natural ability to model multirelational data. Building upon these two promising properties, in this work, we show best practices for designing GCNs for image classification; in some cases even outperforming CNNs on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and PASCAL image datasets.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to image classification using hierarchical multigraph networks (HMN). HMN is a new architecture that exploits graph representations to capture high-level semantic relationships between objects within images. By leveraging both global contextual relationships across different levels of abstraction as well as local, fine-grained details at each level, we demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods on several benchmark datasets. Our method utilizes a multi-task framework, allowing us to jointly learn from multiple object detection tasks while optimizing parameters efficiently. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to current approaches used by top participants in the COCO object detection challenge. We believe that these advancements open up exciting opportunities for future research into scalable and interpretable deep learning models that leverage rich relational structures.",1
"Finding the biomarkers associated with ASD is helpful for understanding the underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatment. A promising approach to identify biomarkers is using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can be used to analyze graph structured data, i.e. brain networks constructed by fMRI. One way to interpret important features is through looking at how the classification probability changes if the features are occluded or replaced. The major limitation of this approach is that replacing values may change the distribution of the data and lead to serious errors. Therefore, we develop a 2-stage pipeline to eliminate the need to replace features for reliable biomarker interpretation. Specifically, we propose an inductive GNN to embed the graphs containing different properties of task-fMRI for identifying ASD and then discover the brain regions/sub-graphs used as evidence for the GNN classifier. We first show GNN can achieve high accuracy in identifying ASD. Next, we calculate the feature importance scores using GNN and compare the interpretation ability with Random Forest. Finally, we run with different atlases and parameters, proving the robustness of the proposed method. The detected biomarkers reveal their association with social behaviors. We also show the potential of discovering new informative biomarkers. Our pipeline can be generalized to other graph feature importance interpretation problems.",0
"In recent years, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) has become increasingly important as a tool for identifying neural biomarkers that can aid in diagnosing neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. However, interpreting these biomarkers remains challenging due to their complex, multidimensional nature. Here we present a novel method for analyzing tfMRI data using graph convolutional networks (GCN). GCNs have previously been shown to excel at processing spatially structured data like brain connectivity graphs, but until now there has been no attempt to apply them to task fMRI data analysis. Our results demonstrate that GCNs are capable of accurately extracting relevant features from the raw dataset which significantly improve performance on downstream diagnostic classification tasks over standard approaches. We believe our work opens up exciting possibilities for advancing how we interpret task-fMRI biomarkers and potentially improving patient outcomes across a wide range of conditions.",1
"Co-Clustering, the problem of simultaneously identifying clusters across multiple aspects of a data set, is a natural generalization of clustering to higher-order structured data. Recent convex formulations of bi-clustering and tensor co-clustering, which shrink estimated centroids together using a convex fusion penalty, allow for global optimality guarantees and precise theoretical analysis, but their computational properties have been less well studied. In this note, we present three efficient operator-splitting methods for the convex co-clustering problem: a standard two-block ADMM, a Generalized ADMM which avoids an expensive tensor Sylvester equation in the primal update, and a three-block ADMM based on the operator splitting scheme of Davis and Yin. Theoretical complexity analysis suggests, and experimental evidence confirms, that the Generalized ADMM is far more efficient for large problems.",0
"The field of matrix factorization has seen many techniques proposed for obtaining low rank approximations of data matrices, with one popular approach being the use of alternating least squares (ALS) optimization. However, recent work has shown that methods based on splitting can perform as well or better than existing ALS-based approaches across a range of applications. Motivated by these results, we present a novel framework for solving bi-clustering problems that extends previous work on splitting algorithms for co-clustering problems. We introduce two new families of algorithms, referred to as Bregman Lagrangian splitting (BLS) and proximal gradient descent splitting (PGDS). For each family of algorithms, we propose both exact and inexact variants that offer different tradeoffs between computational efficiency and accuracy. Experimental evaluation using real and synthetic datasets shows that our BLS and PGDS frameworks outperform current state-of-the-art methods for convex bi-clustering problems. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of splitting methods for solving challenging clustering problems, particularly those involving nonconvex formulations or nonsmooth regularizers.",1
"We present a versatile formulation of the convolution operation that we term a ""mapped convolution."" The standard convolution operation implicitly samples the pixel grid and computes a weighted sum. Our mapped convolution decouples these two components, freeing the operation from the confines of the image grid and allowing the kernel to process any type of structured data. As a test case, we demonstrate its use by applying it to dense inference on spherical data. We perform an in-depth study of existing spherical image convolution methods and propose an improved sampling method for equirectangular images. Then, we discuss the impact of data discretization when deriving a sampling function, highlighting drawbacks of the cube map representation for spherical data. Finally, we illustrate how mapped convolutions enable us to convolve directly on a mesh by projecting the spherical image onto a geodesic grid and training on the textured mesh. This method exceeds the state of the art for spherical depth estimation by nearly 17%. Our findings suggest that mapped convolutions can be instrumental in expanding the application scope of convolutional neural networks.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has seen explosive growth thanks to advances such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been successfully applied to image recognition tasks. CNNs leverage the local connectivity properties of grid-based data, such as images, by using shared weights among nearby neurons. However, these architectures often suffer from slow parameter sharing due to the large receptive fields required to capture global context, resulting in high memory usage and computational cost. To address these challenges, we propose mapped convolutions - a novel architecture that learns both feature maps and their spatial locations, allowing for flexible computation of convolution on arbitrary graphs. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets while significantly reducing model size and complexity. Our framework enables efficient computation over irregular domains and holds promise for future developments in computer vision, graphics, and other domains where graph structure plays a key role. This work represents an important step towards realizing expressive generalization via end-to-end trainable models in artificial intelligence.",1
"Neural machine translation models are used to automatically generate a document from given source code since this can be regarded as a machine translation task. Source code summarization is one of the components for automatic document generation, which generates a summary in natural language from given source code. This suggests that techniques used in neural machine translation, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), can be used for source code summarization. However, there is a considerable difference between source code and natural language: Source code is essentially {\em structured}, having loops and conditional branching, etc. Therefore, there is some obstacle to apply known machine translation models to source code.   Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) capture these structural properties and play an important role in recent machine learning studies on source code. Tree-LSTM is proposed as a generalization of LSTMs for tree-structured data. However, there is a critical issue when applying it to ASTs: It cannot handle a tree that contains nodes having an arbitrary number of children and their order simultaneously, which ASTs generally have such nodes. To address this issue, we propose an extension of Tree-LSTM, which we call \emph{Multi-way Tree-LSTM} and apply it for source code summarization. As a result of computational experiments, our proposal achieved better results when compared with several state-of-the-art techniques.",0
"Incorporating source code summarization techniques into software engineering tools can significantly aid developers in understanding complex systems by reducing the effort required to navigate them. Although recent advances have been made in developing such methods using machine learning models, most of these approaches still struggle with accurately capturing important features within large and/or deeply nested structures. To address this challenge, we propose the use of extended tree-LSTM (eTreeLSTM) architectures which enable better representation of hierarchical relationships in source code files. Our experimental evaluation shows that eTreeLSTMs outperform state-of-the-art baseline models across multiple metrics, demonstrating their effectiveness in generating accurate and concise code summaries. Overall, our study represents an important step towards enhancing developer productivity by providing efficient means for navigating code bases.",1
"Extracting key information from documents, such as receipts or invoices, and preserving the interested texts to structured data is crucial in the document-intensive streamline processes of office automation in areas that includes but not limited to accounting, financial, and taxation areas. To avoid designing expert rules for each specific type of document, some published works attempt to tackle the problem by learning a model to explore the semantic context in text sequences based on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) method in the NLP field. In this paper, we propose to harness the effective information from both semantic meaning and spatial distribution of texts in documents. Specifically, our proposed model, Convolutional Universal Text Information Extractor (CUTIE), applies convolutional neural networks on gridded texts where texts are embedded as features with semantical connotations. We further explore the effect of employing different structures of convolutional neural network and propose a fast and portable structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a dataset with up to $4,484$ labelled receipts, without any pre-training or post-processing, achieving state of the art performance that is much better than the NER based methods in terms of either speed and accuracy. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed CUTIE model being able to achieve good performance with a much smaller amount of training data.",0
"Here at OpenAI we present to you ""CUTIE: Learning to Understand Documents with Convolutional Universal Text Information Extractor"". While there have been many methods proposed to extract relevant pieces of text from documents, CUTIE represents something new by using deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the art performance on several benchmark datasets. We show how our model can effectively learn to identify objects in images, despite only receiving as input raw text from surrounding documents. In addition, we demonstrate that even though the training process was performed on one dataset, CUTIE generalizes well across multiple other datasets with no additional fine tuning required - allowing for quick deployment into applications such as OCR or question answering systems without any extra effort. This work contributes to the field of natural language processing by providing strong baseline results which future models can attempt to beat.

"Compared with shallow domain adaptation, recent progress in deep domain adaptation has shown that it can achieve higher predictive performance and stronger capacity to tackle structural data (e.g., image and sequential data). The underlying idea of deep domain adaptation is to bridge the gap between source and target domains in a joint space so that a supervised classifier trained on labeled source data can be nicely transferred to the target domain. This idea is certainly intuitive and powerful, however, limited theoretical understandings have been developed to support its underpinning principle. In this paper, we have provided a rigorous framework to explain why it is possible to close the gap of the target and source domains in the joint space. More specifically, we first study the loss incurred when performing transfer learning from the source to the target domain. This provides a theory that explains and generalizes existing work in deep domain adaptation which was mainly empirical. This enables us to further explain why closing the gap in the joint space can directly minimize the loss incurred for transfer learning between the two domains. To our knowledge, this offers the first theoretical result that characterizes a direct bound on the joint space and the gain of transfer learning via deep domain adaptation",0
"This paper presents some theoretical findings on deep domain adaptation that shed light on how machine learning models can be adapted to new domains quickly and efficiently. The authors analyze existing approaches and identify key limitations, then propose novel methods for overcoming these challenges. They demonstrate that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by significant margins across a variety of tasks and datasets. Overall, this research advances our understanding of deep domain adaption and has important implications for a wide range of applications, from computer vision to natural language processing. Keywords: Domain adaptation, deep learning, transfer learning, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks.",1
"Advanced methods of applying deep learning to structured data such as graphs have been proposed in recent years. In particular, studies have focused on generalizing convolutional neural networks to graph data, which includes redefining the convolution and the downsampling (pooling) operations for graphs. The method of generalizing the convolution operation to graphs has been proven to improve performance and is widely used. However, the method of applying downsampling to graphs is still difficult to perform and has room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph pooling method based on self-attention. Self-attention using graph convolution allows our pooling method to consider both node features and graph topology. To ensure a fair comparison, the same training procedures and model architectures were used for the existing pooling methods and our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior graph classification performance on the benchmark datasets using a reasonable number of parameters.",0
"In this paper, we propose a new method for graph pooling called self-attention graph pooling (SAGP). Traditional methods for graph pooling use fixed rules that may not capture important structural properties of the input graphs, leading to suboptimal results. SAGP instead uses attention mechanisms to dynamically weight the importance of different nodes and edges within each graph, allowing it to focus on the most salient features. This enables SAGP to better preserve the overall structure and properties of the original graphs during pooling, making it more effective than previous methods. We evaluate the performance of our approach using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that SAGP achieves state-of-the-art results across a variety of tasks including node classification, edge prediction, and graph generation. Overall, our work shows the effectiveness of using attention mechanisms for graph pooling and sets the stage for future research exploring these ideas further.",1
"For many structured learning tasks, the data annotation process is complex and costly. Existing annotation schemes usually aim at acquiring completely annotated structures, under the common perception that partial structures are of low quality and could hurt the learning process. This paper questions this common perception, motivated by the fact that structures consist of interdependent sets of variables. Thus, given a fixed budget, partly annotating each structure may provide the same level of supervision, while allowing for more structures to be annotated. We provide an information theoretic formulation for this perspective and use it, in the context of three diverse structured learning tasks, to show that learning from partial structures can sometimes outperform learning from complete ones. Our findings may provide important insights into structured data annotation schemes and could support progress in learning protocols for structured tasks.",0
"This paper presents an examination of partial versus complete solutions in problem-solving and decision making. We investigate how different types of solutions can impact outcomes and discuss factors that may influence whether partial or complete solutions are preferred. Our analysis suggests that while complete solutions can lead to optimal results, they may not always be feasible or desirable. On the other hand, partial solutions can offer benefits such as flexibility, adaptability, and simplicity but may sacrifice some degree of effectiveness. Ultimately, we argue that there may be no one-size-fits-all solution and the choice between partial or complete solutions should depend on the specific situation at hand.",1
"Machine-learning driven safety-critical autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, must be able to detect situations where its trained model is not able to make a trustworthy prediction. Often viewed as a black-box, it is non-obvious to determine when a model will make a safe decision and when it will make an erroneous, perhaps life-threatening one. Prior work on novelty detection deal with highly structured data and do not translate well to dynamic, real-world situations. This paper proposes a multi-step framework for the detection of novel scenarios in vision-based autonomous systems by leveraging information learned by the trained prediction model and a new image similarity metric. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through experiments on a real-world driving dataset as well as on our in-house indoor racing environment.",0
"In recent years, novelty detection has become increasingly important as a tool for anomaly detection. Anomalies can occur due to several reasons including errors in data entry, new types of attacks on systems, faults in sensors, etc. They should be identified quickly so that appropriate action could be taken. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used previously for detecting anomalies by learning features from normal training data and then identifying deviations from these learned features. However, these methods often require large amounts of labeled data which may not always be available. To address this issue, we propose using saliency maps generated by CNN models during inference to identify anomalies. This approach requires no extra labels other than those required for the base model itself. Our experiments show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the art methods in terms of accuracy while requiring less amount of training data. We believe that network saliency provides a powerful tool for detecting anomalies without the need for expensive annotations. -----",1
"Graph data widely exist in many high-impact applications. Inspired by the success of deep learning in grid-structured data, graph neural network models have been proposed to learn powerful node-level or graph-level representation. However, most of the existing graph neural networks suffer from the following limitations: (1) there is limited analysis regarding the graph convolution properties, such as seed-oriented, degree-aware and order-free; (2) the node's degree-specific graph structure is not explicitly expressed in graph convolution for distinguishing structure-aware node neighborhoods; (3) the theoretical explanation regarding the graph-level pooling schemes is unclear.   To address these problems, we propose a generic degree-specific graph neural network named DEMO-Net motivated by Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test that recursively identifies 1-hop neighborhood structures. In order to explicitly capture the graph topology integrated with node attributes, we argue that graph convolution should have three properties: seed-oriented, degree-aware, order-free. To this end, we propose multi-task graph convolution where each task represents node representation learning for nodes with a specific degree value, thus leading to preserving the degree-specific graph structure. In particular, we design two multi-task learning methods: degree-specific weight and hashing functions for graph convolution. In addition, we propose a novel graph-level pooling/readout scheme for learning graph representation provably lying in a degree-specific Hilbert kernel space. The experimental results on several node and graph classification benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed DEMO-Net over state-of-the-art graph neural network models.",0
"This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) model called DEMO-Net specifically designed for node classification and graph classification tasks. Unlike traditional GNNs that operate on entire graphs as input, our approach utilizes degree-specific message passing, which allows information exchange among nodes based on their degrees of connectivity. By doing so, we effectively reduce computational complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, DEMO-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while using fewer parameters. Additionally, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our method, validating the importance of degree-specific message passing in realizing high performance under resource constraints. Our findings indicate potential applications in scenarios where computation resources are limited, such as edge computing and mobile devices.",1
"Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have proved to be suitable in tasks on unstructured data. Particularly in tasks as community detection, node classification, and link prediction. However, most GNN models still operate with static relationships. We propose the Graph Learning Network (GLN), a simple yet effective process to learn node embeddings and structure prediction functions. Our model uses graph convolutions to propose expected node features, and predict the best structure based on them. We repeat these steps recursively to enhance the prediction and the embeddings.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing algorithms that can learn from data without requiring explicit labels or supervision. One promising approach to addressing this challenge is through graph learning networks (GLNs), which are structures that capture relationships between pairs of objects in a dataset. These GLNs enable efficient computation of distances between points in high-dimensional spaces, allowing for more accurate model training and better generalization performance across different tasks. This paper presents a new algorithm called Graph Learning Network (GLN) that leverages these properties to improve upon existing methods for structure learning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmark datasets while offering competitive runtime performance. We also demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to several real-world applications, including semi-supervised classification, anomaly detection, and domain adaptation.",1
"We present RL-VAE, a graph-to-graph variational autoencoder that uses reinforcement learning to decode molecular graphs from latent embeddings. Methods have been described previously for graph-to-graph autoencoding, but these approaches require sophisticated decoders that increase the complexity of training and evaluation (such as requiring parallel encoders and decoders or non-trivial graph matching). Here, we repurpose a simple graph generator to enable efficient decoding and generation of molecular graphs.",0
"Here is a draft:  In recent years, machine learning has been applied successfully to problems such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One important task that remains difficult is drug discovery; traditional methods rely heavily on human intuition and expertise, but these can only go so far due to their limited ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. To address this challenge, we propose using molecular graph embeddings, which represent molecules as high-dimensional vectors in Euclidean space. However, existing algorithms suffer from several drawbacks, including the tendency to overfit small datasets, sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, difficulty scaling up to larger models, and limited interpretability. In response, we develop a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that addresses each of these issues simultaneously while improving the accuracy of embedding generation across multiple benchmark datasets by at least four percentage points relative to the current state-of-the-art method. We hope our work provides a foundation for future progress toward automating drug design with deep learning techniques.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be successful in many classification tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. However, accuracy alone is not enough for high-stakes decision making. Decision makers want to know the likelihood that a specific GNN prediction is correct. For this purpose, obtaining calibrated models is essential. In this work, we perform an empirical evaluation of the calibration of state-of-the-art GNNs on multiple datasets. Our experiments show that GNNs can be calibrated in some datasets but also badly miscalibrated in others, and that state-of-the-art calibration methods are helpful but do not fix the problem.",0
"While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in many applications, there has been growing concern that they may be overhyped due to their strong performance on benchmark datasets which may no longer reflect real-world conditions. In our paper, we investigate whether GNNs are indeed miscalibrated by comparing their predictions against ground truth labels in multiple domains. Our results suggest that while GNNs perform well on benchmark datasets, they often struggle when faced with more complex tasks and real-world data, leading to significant calibration issues. We provide insights into why these calibration problems occur and discuss possible solutions to address them. Ultimately, our findings highlight the importance of evaluating GNN models beyond benchmark datasets to ensure that they deliver accurate and reliable predictions in practice.",1
"This paper extends the proof of density of neural networks in the space of continuous (or even measurable) functions on Euclidean spaces to functions on compact sets of probability measures. By doing so the work parallels a more then a decade old results on mean-map embedding of probability measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The work has wide practical consequences for multi-instance learning, where it theoretically justifies some recently proposed constructions. The result is then extended to Cartesian products, yielding universal approximation theorem for tree-structured domains, which naturally occur in data-exchange formats like JSON, XML, YAML, AVRO, and ProtoBuffer. This has important practical implications, as it enables to automatically create an architecture of neural networks for processing structured data (AutoML paradigms), as demonstrated by an accompanied library for JSON format.",0
"This is a fascinating research paper that delves into the approximation capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANNs) on two distinct spaces: probability measure spaces and tree-structured data domains. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of deep learning methods, such as ANNs, to approximate functions defined over complex and high-dimensional input spaces. However, there are still many open questions regarding the performance and limitations of these models, particularly in settings where the underlying structure of the problem may not align well with traditional feedforward architectures. The authors investigate how ANNs can effectively learn continuous maps from a space of probability measures onto itself - a task relevant in applications including density estimation and generative modelling. They show that under mild assumptions on the model architecture, ANNs with random weights can achieve arbitrary precision in approximating any Lipschitz function on this domain, making them universal approximators in this setting. Next, the paper turns to consider the case of tree-structured data, which arise frequently in natural language processing tasks like text generation and sentiment analysis. Here the authors develop new techniques to design ANNs tailored specifically for tree structured inputs and prove that they can match the accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art recurrent neural network based approaches. Overall, this work represents important progress towards understanding the strengths and limitations of ANNs as tools for solving challenging problems across diverse domains. Its findings have broad implications for applied machine learning practice and further theoretical explorations.",1
"Most of the successful deep neural network architectures are structured, often consisting of elements like convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent neural networks. Recently, graph neural networks have been successfully applied to graph structured data such as point cloud and molecular data. These networks often only consider pairwise dependencies, as they operate on a graph structure. We generalize the graph neural network into a factor graph neural network (FGNN) in order to capture higher order dependencies. We show that FGNN is able to represent Max-Product Belief Propagation, an approximate inference algorithm on probabilistic graphical models; hence it is able to do well when Max-Product does well. Promising results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0
"Factor graphs have emerged as a powerful graphical representation technique for probabilistic inference problems including but not limited to computer vision applications such as object recognition, image segmentation, pose estimation, 3D reconstruction etc. They model uncertainty in variables by their probability distributions using conditional independence relationships between random variables represented by nodes or factors, which correspond to probability functions, while edges represent constraints that factorize these probability functions. Exact inference in high dimensional factor graphs is computationally intractable and approximate methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques can suffer from slow convergence. Recently deep learning has been used extensively as a tool to solve large scale non linear optimization problems especially in computer vision tasks. In this work we investigate the use of neural networks to learn factorized approximations of the joint probability distribution from observations without any assumption on the form of the potential function, this leads us naturally to define Variational autoencoders (VAE), deep determinantal point processes, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) as special cases of our framework depending on how we choose to regularize the network. We also experimentally demonstrate on real world datasets that our method achieves state of art results with faster training times as compared to existing methods .",1
"Recently, a method [7] was proposed to generate contrastive explanations for differentiable models such as deep neural networks, where one has complete access to the model. In this work, we propose a method, Model Agnostic Contrastive Explanations Method (MACEM), to generate contrastive explanations for \emph{any} classification model where one is able to \emph{only} query the class probabilities for a desired input. This allows us to generate contrastive explanations for not only neural networks, but models such as random forests, boosted trees and even arbitrary ensembles that are still amongst the state-of-the-art when learning on structured data [13]. Moreover, to obtain meaningful explanations we propose a principled approach to handle real and categorical features leading to novel formulations for computing pertinent positives and negatives that form the essence of a contrastive explanation. A detailed treatment of the different data types of this nature was not performed in the previous work, which assumed all features to be positive real valued with zero being indicative of the least interesting value. We part with this strong implicit assumption and generalize these methods so as to be applicable across a much wider range of problem settings. We quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach over 5 public datasets covering diverse domains.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach called model agnostic contrastive explanations (MACE) that enables humans to interpret machine learning models trained on structured data. Traditionally, interpreting machine learning models has been challenging due to their black box nature, which often requires domain experts to make sense of complex mathematical representations. MACE addresses this problem by providing intuitive explanations that are grounded in human understanding. We showcase how our method can be applied to different types of tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and graph representation learning problems. Our experimental results demonstrate that MACE improves over baseline methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and user studies. This work provides new opportunities for explainability research in artificial intelligence, enabling broader adoption of machine learning applications in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy.",1
"Bottom-Up Hidden Tree Markov Model is a highly expressive model for tree-structured data. Unfortunately, it cannot be used in practice due to the intractable size of its state-transition matrix. We propose a new approximation which lies on the Tucker factorisation of tensors. The probabilistic interpretation of such approximation allows us to define a new probabilistic model for tree-structured data. Hence, we define the new approximated model and we derive its learning algorithm. Then, we empirically assess the effective power of the new model evaluating it on two different tasks. In both cases, our model outperforms the other approximated model known in the literature.",0
"This work presents Bayesian Tensor Factorisation (BTF), a novel method for learning bottom-up hidden tree Markov models from data. These models are widely used in natural language processing tasks such as dependency parsing, constituency parsing, semantic role labelling, and machine translation. However, current approaches rely on heuristics that may struggle to capture complex relationships between elements in the model, resulting in suboptimal performance.  Our proposed approach uses tensor factorisation techniques to learn the parameters of these models in a principled manner, allowing us to overcome some of the limitations of existing methods. We employ variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the factors given the observed data, which enables efficient computation even for large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple NLP tasks, including both intrinsic evaluation metrics like perplexity and extrinsic evaluation metrics like F1 scores. Our framework provides a flexible and extensible foundation for future research in this domain. Overall, we believe that our contributions significantly advance the understanding and application of bottom-up HTMMs for NLP problems.",1
"Much of the recent work on learning molecular representations has been based on Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). These models rely on local aggregation operations and can therefore miss higher-order graph properties. To remedy this, we propose Path-Augmented Graph Transformer Networks (PAGTN) that are explicitly built on longer-range dependencies in graph-structured data. Specifically, we use path features in molecular graphs to create global attention layers. We compare our PAGTN model against the GCN model and show that our model consistently outperforms GCNs on molecular property prediction datasets including quantum chemistry (QM7, QM8, QM9), physical chemistry (ESOL, Lipophilictiy) and biochemistry (BACE, BBBP).",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements over the past decade, thanks largely to deep learning architectures such as transformers which have achieved state-of-the-art results across many natural language processing tasks. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing models that can integrate both structure and semantics to better capture relationships within and between sentences. One approach that achieves this integration is through graph representations where tokens represent nodes and edges represent relations. However, training transformer networks on graphs remains challenging due to computational constraints arising from the quadratic scaling of messages with respect to the number of neighbours. This paper presents path augmentation, a novel method that extends traditional attention mechanisms by first adding paths derived from the underlying graph structure during training, before applying selfattention. Experimental evaluation shows our model outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating structural information into AI models trained with large-scale data resources. We conclude by discussing future research directions towards even more scalable approaches to leveraging graph structures and other forms of background knowledge.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved lots of success on graph-structured data. In the light of this, there has been increasing interest in studying their representation power. One line of work focuses on the universal approximation of permutation-invariant functions by certain classes of GNNs, and another demonstrates the limitation of GNNs via graph isomorphism tests.   Our work connects these two perspectives and proves their equivalence. We further develop a framework of the representation power of GNNs with the language of sigma-algebra, which incorporates both viewpoints. Using this framework, we compare the expressive power of different classes of GNNs as well as other methods on graphs. In particular, we prove that order-2 Graph G-invariant networks fail to distinguish non-isomorphic regular graphs with the same degree. We then extend them to a new architecture, Ring-GNNs, which succeeds on distinguishing these graphs and provides improvements on real-world social network datasets.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to effectively model complex relationships between nodes in graphs and achieve state-of-the-art results in tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. However, little attention has been paid to their potential role in graph matching problems like graph isomorphism testing. In our work, we demonstrate that GNNs can learn exact embeddings that encode all relevant structural properties of input graphs up to graph automorphism and propose novel architectures based on randomized linear algebra techniques to reduce computational complexity without affecting model expressivity. We establish theoretical foundations by proving under certain conditions that approximate GNN models using these architectures can solve graph isomorphism testing exactly in polynomial time, whereas existing solutions rely on exponential brute-force algorithms. Finally, through extensive experiments across numerous real-world datasets and benchmark collections, we validate both the effectiveness and efficiency gains achieved by our methods over existing alternatives, offering compelling evidence of the strong promise of utilizing GNNs for solving graph matching challenges beyond standard downstream graph learning tasks.

"We propose GraphNVP, the first invertible, normalizing flow-based molecular graph generation model. We decompose the generation of a graph into two steps: generation of (i) an adjacency tensor and (ii) node attributes. This decomposition yields the exact likelihood maximization on graph-structured data, combined with two novel reversible flows. We empirically demonstrate that our model efficiently generates valid molecular graphs with almost no duplicated molecules. In addition, we observe that the learned latent space can be used to generate molecules with desired chemical properties.",0
"GraphNVP is a novel flow-based generative model that generates molecular graphs using invertible transformations. The authors propose a variational autoencoder architecture composed of two types of neural networks: one for encoding input graphs into latent space representations and another for decoding these representations back to graph space. This approach enables efficient computation and allows easy sampling from the underlying distribution over graphs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including randomly generated as well as real chemical compounds. Results show that GraphNVP outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving high accuracy across multiple evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The work presents a significant contribution to the field by providing a new architecture capable of generating valid and diverse molecules directly in structural form, without any intermediate textual representation. Overall, GraphNVP has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery research by enabling automation of chemists’ routine tasks related to exploring synthetic routes, property prediction, and optimizing structures.",1
"Many machine learning tasks such as multiple instance learning, 3D shape recognition, and few-shot image classification are defined on sets of instances. Since solutions to such problems do not depend on the order of elements of the set, models used to address them should be permutation invariant. We present an attention-based neural network module, the Set Transformer, specifically designed to model interactions among elements in the input set. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which rely on attention mechanisms. In an effort to reduce computational complexity, we introduce an attention scheme inspired by inducing point methods from sparse Gaussian process literature. It reduces the computation time of self-attention from quadratic to linear in the number of elements in the set. We show that our model is theoretically attractive and we evaluate it on a range of tasks, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods for set-structured data.",0
"SetTransformer is based on the observation that natural language processing tasks often require models which can process sets of inputs (strings) as first class objects. Unfortunately, current deep learning architectures typically operate over scalars or sequences, so they aren't easily adapted to these problems. In practice, one solution has been to vectorize sets into high-dimensional representations whose structure cannot be meaningfully interpreted; another is to split sets apart into individual elements before feeding them through the model. However, neither approach is ideal because they destroy the combinatorial nature of sets and often lose valuable contextual information in the process. Motivated by this challenge, we present SetTransformer, a novel attention mechanism designed specifically for permutation invariant neural network models operating directly on sets. Our method uses a selfattentive layer and multiheaded dot product attention to provide multiple parallel attentions among set elements with arbitrary positions. This allows our model to capture both local interactions within subsets of input elements and global dependencies across the entire set. We evaluate SetTransformer on several benchmark datasets and show that our architecture significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods using strong baselines like BERT4Rec and GraphBert. Finally, we demonstrate that our learned features transfer effectively to downstream classification tasks, highlighting their effectiveness at capturing semantic relationships between set elements.",1
"Graph neural networks have become one of the most important techniques to solve machine learning problems on graph-structured data. Recent work on vertex classification proposed deep and distributed learning models to achieve high performance and scalability. However, we find that the feature vectors of benchmark datasets are already quite informative for the classification task, and the graph structure only provides a means to denoise the data. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework based on graph signal processing for analyzing graph neural networks. Our results indicate that graph neural networks only perform low-pass filtering on feature vectors and do not have the non-linear manifold learning property. We further investigate their resilience to feature noise and propose some insights on GCN-based graph neural network design.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for handling structured data on graphs such as social networks, molecular structures, and knowledge graphs. Despite their successes, there has been growing concern that GNN models suffer from overfitting due to their repeated application of nonlinear transformations. In practice, these concerns have led researchers to apply regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay to constrain model complexity. However, these methods can only do so much to address the underlying issue of oversmoothing, where high-frequency features are averaged out during message passing.  This work seeks to shed light on the fundamental limitations of GNNs by examining them through the lens of signal processing. Specifically, we show that popular GNN architectures can be understood as linear filters applied repeatedly along eigenvectors corresponding to small eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, these filters turn out to be low-pass filters that attenuate high-frequency information. While this filtering effect is desirable when dealing with noise, it may hinder performance if important discriminative patterns reside in those frequencies.  To demonstrate the impact of these findings, we conduct experiments using three benchmark datasets commonly used to evaluate GNN models (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed). Our results suggest that current state-of-the-art GNNs already operate close to capacity for many tasks and underscore the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when designing effective GNN architectures. Finally, we discuss potential future directions for research aimed at balancing high frequency preservation while retaining benefits afforded by low-pass filters. Overall, our insights contribute towards a better understanding of GNN models, their strengths and weaknesses, and provide guidance on choosing appropriate graph representations for real-world applications.",1
"Auto-encoders have emerged as a successful framework for unsupervised learning. However, conventional auto-encoders are incapable of utilizing explicit relations in structured data. To take advantage of relations in graph-structured data, several graph auto-encoders have recently been proposed, but they neglect to reconstruct either the graph structure or node attributes. In this paper, we present the graph attention auto-encoder (GATE), a neural network architecture for unsupervised representation learning on graph-structured data. Our architecture is able to reconstruct graph-structured inputs, including both node attributes and the graph structure, through stacked encoder/decoder layers equipped with self-attention mechanisms. In the encoder, by considering node attributes as initial node representations, each layer generates new representations of nodes by attending over their neighbors' representations. In the decoder, we attempt to reverse the encoding process to reconstruct node attributes. Moreover, node representations are regularized to reconstruct the graph structure. Our proposed architecture does not need to know the graph structure upfront, and thus it can be applied to inductive learning. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance on several node classification benchmark datasets for transductive and inductive tasks, even exceeding the performance of supervised learning baselines in most cases.",0
"""Graph Attention Auto-encoders: A Comprehensive Overview"" Abstract Deep learning techniques have been applied in diverse fields ranging from computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to bioinformatics and game playing. In recent years, graph data has become increasingly important due to the rise of social media platforms, complex networks like brain connectomes, citation graphs, protein interactions, among others, thus creating a need for new architectures capable of handling structured data represented as graphs. Here we provide an overview of state-of-the art models that handle nonlinear relationships through self attention mechanism in autoencoder frameworks, specifically designed to work on graph structured data. We compare their strengths and limitations focusing on three main aspects related to these models: encoder design, decoding process, and attention mechanisms. Finally, applications using graph attention autoencoders are discussed briefly along with future research directions.

"We present batch virtual adversarial training (BVAT), a novel regularization method for graph convolutional networks (GCNs). BVAT addresses the shortcoming of GCNs that do not consider the smoothness of the model's output distribution against local perturbations around the input. We propose two algorithms, sample-based BVAT and optimization-based BVAT, which are suitable to promote the smoothness of the model for graph-structured data by either finding virtual adversarial perturbations for a subset of nodes far from each other or generating virtual adversarial perturbations for all nodes with an optimization process. Extensive experiments on three citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed and a knowledge graph dataset Nell validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which establishes state-of-the-art results in the semi-supervised node classification tasks.",0
"Abstract:  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used for graph data analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and recommendation systems. However, training GCNs can be challenging due to their sensitivity to noise and outliers in the data. In this work, we propose batch virtual adversarial training (VAT) as a method to improve the robustness and performance of GCNs on graph datasets. Our approach leverages the concept of adversarial examples to regularize the network during training and make it more resilient to input perturbations. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets and show that our proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and stability of the trained models compared to existing approaches. This study contributes to the field of graph neural networks by providing a new tool for enhancing model robustness and achieving better generalization performance.",1
"The construction of a meaningful graph topology plays a crucial role in the effective representation, processing, analysis and visualization of structured data. When a natural choice of the graph is not readily available from the data sets, it is thus desirable to infer or learn a graph topology from the data. In this tutorial overview, we survey solutions to the problem of graph learning, including classical viewpoints from statistics and physics, and more recent approaches that adopt a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We further emphasize the conceptual similarities and differences between classical and GSP-based graph inference methods, and highlight the potential advantage of the latter in a number of theoretical and practical scenarios. We conclude with several open issues and challenges that are keys to the design of future signal processing and machine learning algorithms for learning graphs from data.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in learning graphical models from data. Graphs provide a powerful tool for capturing complex relationships between variables and can offer valuable insights into many domains including natural language processing, computer vision, and neuroscience. However, inferring graph structures from noisy and high dimensional data remains a challenging task due to their combinatorial nature and uncertainty associated with limited sample sizes. To address these issues, we propose a framework that exploits the connection between graph learning and signal processing, termed as Signal Representation Graph (SRG). SRG represents each variable as a mixture of latent signals which are encoded using dictionaries learned jointly with the graph structure. By positing these signals on the vertices and edges of the graph, we formulate the graph inference problem as a linear regression where we aim to recover both the dictionary atoms and sparse coefficients associated with each vertex. We show how this perspective allows us to leverage techniques such as compressed sensing and sparse coding to learn graphs effectively even in low sample settings. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods across several benchmark datasets. This work highlights the potential benefits of exploring the intersection of graph theory and signal processing for discovering meaningful representations of real world phenomena.",1
"Graph neural networks, which generalize deep neural network models to graph structured data, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. They usually learn node representations by transforming, propagating and aggregating node features and have been proven to improve the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and link prediction. To apply graph neural networks for the graph classification task, approaches to generate the \textit{graph representation} from node representations are demanded. A common way is to globally combine the node representations. However, rich structural information is overlooked. Thus a hierarchical pooling procedure is desired to preserve the graph structure during the graph representation learning. There are some recent works on hierarchically learning graph representation analogous to the pooling step in conventional convolutional neural (CNN) networks. However, the local structural information is still largely neglected during the pooling process. In this paper, we introduce a pooling operator $\pooling$ based on graph Fourier transform, which can utilize the node features and local structures during the pooling process. We then design pooling layers based on the pooling operator, which are further combined with traditional GCN convolutional layers to form a graph neural network framework $\m$ for graph classification. Theoretical analysis is provided to understand $\pooling$ from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results of the graph classification task on $6$ commonly used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",0
"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have emerged as powerful tools for processing graph data by leveraging convolutional filters over graph structures. However, due to their high computational complexity, GCNs can become prohibitively expensive when applied to large graphs or deep models. In order to address these issues, we propose EigenPooling, a novel method that approximates the eigendecomposition required in traditional GCN layers without resorting to matrix factorization. Our approach relies on iterative sampling from the graph Laplacian and approximate matrix compression techniques, resulting in significant memory savings while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets that our proposed method significantly reduces computation time and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining competitive model performance. These results highlight the potential of EigenPooling for enabling larger and more complex GCN architectures for real-world applications involving massive graphs. Overall, our work represents a step towards efficient deep learning on graphs at scale.",1
"Benchmark data sets are an indispensable ingredient of the evaluation of graph-based machine learning methods. We release a new data set, compiled from International Planning Competitions (IPC), for benchmarking graph classification, regression, and related tasks. Apart from the graph construction (based on AI planning problems) that is interesting in its own right, the data set possesses distinctly different characteristics from popularly used benchmarks. The data set, named IPC, consists of two self-contained versions, grounded and lifted, both including graphs of large and skewedly distributed sizes, posing substantial challenges for the computation of graph models such as graph kernels and graph neural networks. The graphs in this data set are directed and the lifted version is acyclic, offering the opportunity of benchmarking specialized models for directed (acyclic) structures. Moreover, the graph generator and the labeling are computer programmed; thus, the data set may be extended easily if a larger scale is desired. The data set is accessible from \url{https://github.com/IBM/IPC-graph-data}.",0
"Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in developing machine learning methods for graph structured data, due largely to the increasing availability of networked data on the web (e.g., social networks) and advances in information retrieval techniques that have led to large scale extraction of relational data from documents. We present IPC (Information Pairs Corpus), which contains large collections of binary classification tasks associated with labeled graphs (representing directed relationships among entities). Our evaluation shows strong results across multiple algorithms using our benchmark, indicating its suitability as a standardized dataset in future work comparing models on predictive performance over relational information and structure.",1
"Performing machine learning on structured data is complicated by the fact that such data does not have vectorial form. Therefore, multiple approaches have emerged to construct vectorial representations of structured data, from kernel and distance approaches to recurrent, recursive, and convolutional neural networks. Recent years have seen heightened attention in this demanding field of research and several new approaches have emerged, such as metric learning on structured data, graph convolutional neural networks, and recurrent decoder networks for structured data. In this contribution, we provide an high-level overview of the state-of-the-art in representation learning and embeddings for structured data across a wide range of machine learning fields.",0
"In recent years, representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex data distributions in many domains. One important challenge in representation learning is how to deal with structured input data such as graphs, trees, or tables that have intrinsic hierarchical or relational structure. This paper presents a new framework for embedding structured data into continuous vector spaces while preserving their original structure. We showcase two main applications: (i) predictive models on graphs, where we introduce Graph2Vec, a novel approach based on random walks that captures both local neighborhood properties and global graph topology; (ii) natural language processing tasks that involve tree structures by developing Tree2Vec, which recursively performs depth-first search for each node to explore its subtree context. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines on several benchmark datasets across different task types including link prediction, classification, clustering, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Furthermore, our methods can easily scale up to large graphs and trees with billions of nodes and edges thanks to their efficiency, scalability, and low memory footprints. Overall, we believe this work offers a promising direction towards unifying representation learning techniques for various forms of structured data and advancing the state-of-the-art in multiple areas of artificial intelligence.",1
"Obtaining continuous representations of structural data such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has gained attention in machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, embedding complex DAGs in which both ancestors and descendants of nodes are exponentially increasing is difficult. Tackling in this problem, we develop Disk Embeddings, which is a framework for embedding DAGs into quasi-metric spaces. Existing state-of-the-art methods, Order Embeddings and Hyperbolic Entailment Cones, are instances of Disk Embedding in Euclidean space and spheres respectively. Furthermore, we propose a novel method Hyperbolic Disk Embeddings to handle exponential growth of relations. The results of our experiments show that our Disk Embedding models outperform existing methods especially in complex DAGs other than trees.",0
"This research investigates hyperbolic disk embeddings as a means to visualize directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). DAGs represent complex relationships among nodes, making them difficult to comprehend visually. Existing approaches struggle to capture the scale differences and the intricacies of these diagrams. Our approach uses conformal mapping techniques from hyperbolic geometry to map the nodes onto disks while preserving their distances. We first define a metric that captures both edge length and topology differences. Using this metric, we develop an algorithm for optimal embedding into a circle of fixed size and aspect ratio. Finally, experiments show significant improvements over existing methods by providing more intuitive layouts and better scalability. These results have direct applications in graph drawing, network analysis, and data visualization domains.",1
"Stochastic blockmodels (SBM) and their variants, $e.g.$, mixed-membership and overlapping stochastic blockmodels, are latent variable based generative models for graphs. They have proven to be successful for various tasks, such as discovering the community structure and link prediction on graph-structured data. Recently, graph neural networks, $e.g.$, graph convolutional networks, have also emerged as a promising approach to learn powerful representations (embeddings) for the nodes in the graph, by exploiting graph properties such as locality and invariance. In this work, we unify these two directions by developing a \emph{sparse} variational autoencoder for graphs, that retains the interpretability of SBMs, while also enjoying the excellent predictive performance of graph neural nets. Moreover, our framework is accompanied by a fast recognition model that enables fast inference of the node embeddings (which are of independent interest for inference in SBM and its variants). Although we develop this framework for a particular type of SBM, namely the \emph{overlapping} stochastic blockmodel, the proposed framework can be adapted readily for other types of SBMs. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate encouraging results on link prediction while learning an interpretable latent structure that can be used for community discovery.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in using graph neural networks (GNN) for node classification on large graphs. However, many real world datasets have communities which can only be identified by their characteristic distributions rather than specific node features. To account for these differences, we propose extending GNNs to process stochastic block models (SBM), a popular generative model for community detection. By treating each SBM distribution as a unique layer in our deep learning architecture, we enable robust inference across varying degrees of homophily within and between communities. Our approach uses spectral graph convolutional layers to learn both community structure and node embedding representations, resulting in improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, through ablation studies we demonstrate that incorporating SBM priors into the training process yields more accurate estimates of community membership probabilities. Overall, our work bridges traditional random graph models with modern machine learning techniques, showing great potential for future research in the domain of network science.",1
"This work considers the problem of computing distances between structured objects such as undirected graphs, seen as probability distributions in a specific metric space. We consider a new transportation distance (i.e. that minimizes a total cost of transporting probability masses) that unveils the geometric nature of the structured objects space. Unlike Wasserstein or Gromov-Wasserstein metrics that focus solely and respectively on features (by considering a metric in the feature space) or structure (by seeing structure as a metric space), our new distance exploits jointly both information, and is consequently called Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW). After discussing its properties and computational aspects, we show results on a graph classification task, where our method outperforms both graph kernels and deep graph convolutional networks. Exploiting further on the metric properties of FGW, interesting geometric objects such as Fr\'echet means or barycenters of graphs are illustrated and discussed in a clustering context.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new method for solving optimal transport problems that applies to structured data such as discrete measures on graphs. We develop a variant of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, which is well known for solving unstructured optimal transport problems, and extend it to handle structured data by introducing constraints based on the underlying graph structure. Our approach leverages recent advances in linear programming duality theory to efficiently solve large instances of the problem, resulting in significant improvements over existing methods. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our work in areas such as computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.",1
"This paper addresses the challenging problem of retrieval and matching of graph structured objects, and makes two key contributions. First, we demonstrate how Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which have emerged as an effective model for various supervised prediction problems defined on structured data, can be trained to produce embedding of graphs in vector spaces that enables efficient similarity reasoning. Second, we propose a novel Graph Matching Network model that, given a pair of graphs as input, computes a similarity score between them by jointly reasoning on the pair through a new cross-graph attention-based matching mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on different domains including the challenging problem of control-flow-graph based function similarity search that plays an important role in the detection of vulnerabilities in software systems. The experimental analysis demonstrates that our models are not only able to exploit structure in the context of similarity learning but they can also outperform domain-specific baseline systems that have been carefully hand-engineered for these problems.",0
"In recent years, graph matching has emerged as an important problem in computer vision due to its ability to capture structural properties of complex objects such as shapes and scenes. However, traditional methods based on hand-crafted features have limited performance when applied to large-scale datasets or when dealing with noisy data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Graph Matching Networks (GMN) which uses convolutional neural networks to learn the similarity metric directly from raw image data. Our method extends the popular siamese network architecture by adding additional modules that process spatial hierarchies present in object graphs using dilated convolutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GMN approach through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets including MNIST, COCO Stuff, and VGGFaces2, achieving state-of-the art results on all three tasks while running significantly faster than competing approaches.",1
"Graph classification receives a great deal of attention from the non-Euclidean machine learning community. Recent advances in graph coarsening have enabled the training of deeper networks and produced new state-of-the-art results in many benchmark tasks. We examine how these architectures train and find that performance is highly-sensitive to initialisation and depends strongly on jumping-knowledge structures. We then show that, despite the great complexity of these models, competitive performance is achieved by the simplest of models -- structure-blind MLP, single-layer GCN and fixed-weight GCN -- and propose these be included as baselines in future.",0
"Graph classification is a subfield within machine learning that deals specifically with classifying graphs into predefined categories based on their topological properties. In recent years, several graph classification datasets have been released to facilitate research and evaluation of new approaches in this area. This has resulted in significant progress, with many state-of-the-art methods proposed by leading researchers in the field.  One of the main challenges faced by scientists working on graph classification networks is finding accurate baseline models against which to compare their own results. Several different techniques have been developed to solve this problem, including using traditional statistical measures such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), as well as more advanced deep learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recursive neural networks (RNNs). Despite these advances, there remains room for improvement, particularly in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.  This paper presents an overview of current methodologies used in graph classification, along with details of popular datasets and benchmarking tools available to researchers in this rapidly evolving field. We examine recent efforts aimed at improving graph classification performance through increased use of cutting-edge technologies, and discuss potential future directions for those seeking to push the boundaries of this exciting area of study even further. Our ultimate goal is to provide readers with valuable insights and guidance to enable them to contribute effectively to the development of groundbreaking graph classification networks and techniques.",1
"Interpretable machine learning has become a strong competitor for traditional black-box models. However, the possible loss of the predictive performance for gaining interpretability is often inevitable, putting practitioners in a dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an interpretable model with any black-box model to combine their strengths. The interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where the black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency (defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.) Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with association rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various state-of-the-art black-box models. Results show that hybrid models obtain an efficient trade-off between transparency and predictive performance, characterized by our proposed efficient frontiers.",0
"This paper presents a hybrid predictive model that combines both interpretability and high accuracy by leveraging the complementary strengths of interpretable models (e.g., decision trees) and black box models (e.g., artificial neural networks). We demonstrate how these two types of models can collaborate effectively to make predictions while ensuring that human experts can understand and trust the underlying logic behind them. Our approach enables us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including image classification tasks where deep learning has been shown to excel. Through extensive experiments and case studies, we showcase the effectiveness of our methodology across diverse domains, including medical imaging, finance, and natural language processing, among others. Our work paves the way for future research into hybrid models that balance explainability and prediction accuracy, addressing a key challenge facing modern machine learning practitioners today.",1
Recent years have witnessed some exciting developments in the domain of generating images from scene-based text descriptions. These approaches have primarily focused on generating images from a static text description and are limited to generating images in a single pass. They are unable to generate an image interactively based on an incrementally additive text description (something that is more intuitive and similar to the way we describe an image). We propose a method to generate an image incrementally based on a sequence of graphs of scene descriptions (scene-graphs). We propose a recurrent network architecture that preserves the image content generated in previous steps and modifies the cumulative image as per the newly provided scene information. Our model utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to cater to variable-sized scene graphs along with Generative Adversarial image translation networks to generate realistic multi-object images without needing any intermediate supervision during training. We experiment with Coco-Stuff dataset which has multi-object images along with annotations describing the visual scene and show that our model significantly outperforms other approaches on the same dataset in generating visually consistent images for incrementally growing scene graphs.,0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in recent years, enabling machines to perform tasks that were previously thought only possible by humans such as object detection, image generation, and natural language processing. In particular, generative models have achieved impressive results in generating realistic images from text descriptions, demonstrating their capability to capture complex relationships among visual features. However, most state-of-the-art methods rely on large amounts of data and computational resources which can limit their use cases in practice. Therefore, there is still a need for more efficient yet effective approaches to interactive image generation. This paper presents an approach based on scene graphs which addresses these limitations while providing high-quality output. We propose an algorithm capable of iteratively modifying existing images using user feedback and guiding the model towards desired outputs. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms baseline models both qualitatively and quantitatively, offering improvements in efficiency without sacrificing image fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be applied to a variety of use cases including fashion design, content creation, and product customization, making it a versatile tool for creatives and non-experts alike. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the development of interactive machine learning systems able to generate visually compelling images under tight resource constraints.",1
"3D object recognition accuracy can be improved by learning the multi-scale spatial features from 3D spatial geometric representations of objects such as point clouds, 3D models, surfaces, and RGB-D data. Current deep learning approaches learn such features either using structured data representations (voxel grids and octrees) or from unstructured representations (graphs and point clouds). Learning features from such structured representations is limited by the restriction on resolution and tree depth while unstructured representations creates a challenge due to non-uniformity among data samples. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-level learning approach on a multi-level voxel grid to overcome these drawbacks. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed multi-level learning, we use a multi-level voxel representation of 3D objects to perform object recognition. The multi-level voxel representation consists of a coarse voxel grid that contains volumetric information of the 3D object. In addition, each voxel in the coarse grid that contains a portion of the object boundary is subdivided into multiple fine-level voxel grids. The performance of our multi-level learning algorithm for object recognition is comparable to dense voxel representations while using significantly lower memory.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made tremendous progress in recent years due to advancements in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In particular, 3D CNNs have been shown to effectively capture spatial features in volumetric data. However, these models often require large amounts of computational resources and may not always generalize well across different scales and resolutions. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-level 3D CNN architecture that learns multi-scale spatial features efficiently. Our approach involves designing a pyramidal network consisting of multiple levels, each with varying depths and widths to capture features at different scales. We use skip connections to combine features from lower layers to higher ones and adopt dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields without increasing parameter counts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the importance of considering scale-specific information during training and inference in computer vision tasks involving high-dimensional data.",1
"Graph kernels have attracted a lot of attention during the last decade, and have evolved into a rapidly developing branch of learning on structured data. During the past 20 years, the considerable research activity that occurred in the field resulted in the development of dozens of graph kernels, each focusing on specific structural properties of graphs. Graph kernels have proven successful in a wide range of domains, ranging from social networks to bioinformatics. The goal of this survey is to provide a unifying view of the literature on graph kernels. In particular, we present a comprehensive overview of a wide range of graph kernels. Furthermore, we perform an experimental evaluation of several of those kernels on publicly available datasets, and provide a comparative study.

"This survey explores graph kernels, which are functions that map graphs to vectors in a high-dimensional space, allowing them to be compared using standard kernel methods such as support vector machines (SVMs). We examine how graph kernels can be used to solve important problems in data mining, bioinformatics, computer vision, natural language processing, and other fields. Our discussion includes both traditional graph kernels based on algebraic properties of the graphs themselves and modern graph kernels that encode more global structural features of the graphs. After discussing key concepts and fundamental issues related to graph kernels, we provide a comprehensive list of existing approaches along with their corresponding references. Finally, we summarize recent developments and outline future research directions in the field.",1
"Convolution operations designed for graph-structured data usually utilize the graph Laplacian, which can be seen as message passing between the adjacent neighbors through a generic random walk. In this paper, we propose PAN, a new graph convolution framework that involves every path linking the message sender and receiver with learnable weights depending on the path length, which corresponds to the maximal entropy random walk. PAN generalizes the graph Laplacian to a new transition matrix we call \emph{maximal entropy transition} (MET) matrix derived from a path integral formalism. Most previous graph convolutional network architectures can be adapted to our framework, and many variations and derivatives based on the path integral idea can be developed. Experimental results show that the path integral based graph neural networks have great learnability and fast convergence rate, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tasks.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex relationships in large datasets. However, they often struggle with overfitting due to their high capacity and limited regularization methods available. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called PATH (Path Integral based Approximation for Time Series), which uses path integral calculus to approximate convolution operations on graphs. Our experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques by achieving significant improvements across a wide range of tasks while requiring fewer parameters. Additionally, the use of PATH makes deep graph neural networks easier to train, allowing them to converge faster and produce more accurate predictions. Our work demonstrates the potential of using novel mathematical techniques like path integrals to improve the performance of graph neural networks and overcome some of their limitations.",1
"The variational autoencoder (VAE) framework remains a popular option for training unsupervised generative models, especially for discrete data where generative adversarial networks (GANs) require workaround to create gradient for the generator. In our work modeling US postal addresses, we show that our discrete VAE with tree recursive architecture demonstrates limited capability of capturing field correlations within structured data, even after overcoming the challenge of posterior collapse with scheduled sampling and tuning of the KL-divergence weight $\beta$. Worse, VAE seems to have difficulty mapping its generated samples to the latent space, as their VAE loss lags behind or even increases during the training process. Motivated by this observation, we show that augmenting training data with generated variants (augmented training) and training a VAE with multiple values of $\beta$ simultaneously (multiscale VAE) both improve the generation quality of VAE. Despite their differences in motivation and emphasis, we show that augmented training and multiscale VAE are actually connected and have similar effects on the model.",0
"This may contain parts of other scientific papers, but needs to have more original content as well. I need this as soon as possible, thanks! ----- The authors present a method using generated loss and augmented training data within a multiscale framework that improves the performance of variational autoencoders (VAEs). In recent years, there has been significant interest in understanding the latent space learned by deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) \cite{kingma2014auto}. However, analyzing these spaces can become cumbersome due to their high dimensionality. Here, we propose a novel algorithm named Generating Latent Spaces using Sparse Activation Networks (GSAN), which maps high-dimensional representations into low dimensions while preserving essential features. We show that GSAN can effectively perform feature visualization on large datasets such as CelebA\textunderscore FrontalFace\cite{liu2015faceattributes} without sacrificing quality. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method’s potential impact by examining how facial landmarks are preserved in the reconstructed images and the corresponding lower dimension latent space embeddings. Our work provides insight on how machine learning models could one day be used to synthetically generate missing values from incomplete data matrices instead of down sampling.  -----",1
"We present GraphTSNE, a novel visualization technique for graph-structured data based on t-SNE. The growing interest in graph-structured data increases the importance of gaining human insight into such datasets by means of visualization. Among the most popular visualization techniques, classical t-SNE is not suitable on such datasets because it has no mechanism to make use of information from the graph structure. On the other hand, visualization techniques which operate on graphs, such as Laplacian Eigenmaps and tsNET, have no mechanism to make use of information from node features. Our proposed method GraphTSNE produces visualizations which account for both graph structure and node features. It is based on scalable and unsupervised training of a graph convolutional network on a modified t-SNE loss. By assembling a suite of evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our method produces desirable visualizations on three benchmark datasets.",0
"This paper presents GraphTSNE (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), a novel visualization technique specifically designed for graph-structured data such as social networks, biological systems, financial transactions, among others. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques have limitations when applied to graphs due to their unique characteristics, including nonlinear relationships and network connectivity. Therefore, there is a need for a method that can capture these intricacies while providing meaningful insights into complex graph structures.  Our approach introduces two key innovations over existing methods for visualizing graph-structured data. Firstly, we leverage principles from graph theory to ensure that our embedding preserves the global structure of the original graph, resulting in more interpretable representations. Secondly, we incorporate probabilistic measures derived from local neighborhoods within each node's community, further enhancing the fidelity of the embeddings.  We evaluate GraphTSNE on several real-world datasets comprising both benchmark and proprietary sources, demonstrating improved performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives across a range of evaluation metrics. In particular, our results show significant improvements in visual quality and clustering accuracy, thus confirming the effectiveness of our proposed methodology. Furthermore, the simplicity of our algorithm enables efficient computation and scalability to large datasets, making it readily applicable in practice.  Overall, GraphTSNE provides a powerful toolkit for researchers and practitioners working with graph-structured data, allowing them to gain new insights into complex networks by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.",1
"In many applications where collecting data is expensive, for example neuroscience or medical imaging, the sample size is typically small compared to the feature dimension. It is challenging in this setting to train expressive, non-linear models without overfitting. These datasets call for intelligent regularization that exploits known structure, such as correlations between the features arising from the measurement device. However, existing structured regularizers need specially crafted solvers, which are difficult to apply to complex models. We propose a new regularizer specifically designed to leverage structure in the data in a way that can be applied efficiently to complex models. Our approach relies on feature grouping, using a fast clustering algorithm inside a stochastic gradient descent loop: given a family of feature groupings that capture feature covariations, we randomly select these groups at each iteration. We show that this approach amounts to enforcing a denoising regularizer on the solution. The method is easy to implement in many model architectures, such as fully connected neural networks, and has a linear computational cost. We apply this regularizer to a real-world fMRI dataset and the Olivetti Faces datasets. Experiments on both datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces models that generalize better than those trained with conventional regularizers, and also improves convergence speed.",0
One possible approach to solving high-dimensional problems with structured data involves grouping features together into clusters. These feature groups can then serve as regularizers that reduce overfitting by promoting smoother predictions across groups of similar features. This method allows for efficient model training and outperforms traditional Lasso regularization. Applications have shown improved results on both simulated and real-world datasets including gene expression data and neural recordings from the mouse visual cortex. Future work includes expanding the scope of applicability beyond regression problems and investigating alternative methods for constructing feature groups.,1
"With the prevalence of accessible depth sensors, dynamic human body skeletons have attracted much attention as a robust modality for action recognition. Previous methods model skeletons based on RNN or CNN, which has limited expressive power for irregular skeleton joints. While graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been proposed to address irregular graph-structured data, the fundamental graph construction remains challenging. In this paper, we represent skeletons naturally on graphs, and propose a graph regression based GCN (GR-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition, aiming to capture the spatio-temporal variation in the data. As the graph representation is crucial to graph convolution, we first propose graph regression to statistically learn the underlying graph from multiple observations. In particular, we provide spatio-temporal modeling of skeletons and pose an optimization problem on the graph structure over consecutive frames, which enforces the sparsity of the underlying graph for efficient representation. The optimized graph not only connects each joint to its neighboring joints in the same frame strongly or weakly, but also links with relevant joints in the previous and subsequent frames. We then feed the optimized graph into the GCN along with the coordinates of the skeleton sequence for feature learning, where we deploy high-order and fast Chebyshev approximation of spectral graph convolution. Further, we provide analysis of the variation characterization by the Chebyshev approximation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed graph regression and show that the proposed GR-GCN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the widely used NTU RGB+D, UT-Kinect and SYSU 3D datasets.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, action recognition has been studied extensively as one of the key research topics in computer vision. This study aimed to develop an optimized skeleton-based action recognition method that effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships by using graph regression techniques based on spatially sparse features extracted from skeletons. By introducing a regularizer term into our proposed model, we achieved accurate and efficient representation learning through minimizing the loss function value during training. Extensive experiments were conducted using various benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides new insights into the problem of action recognition and can potentially contribute towards developing more advanced human behavior understanding systems in various applications such as surveillance, healthcare monitoring, entertainment, and robotics.",1
"Generating long and semantic-coherent reports to describe medical images poses great challenges towards bridging visual and linguistic modalities, incorporating medical domain knowledge, and generating realistic and accurate descriptions. We propose a novel Knowledge-driven Encode, Retrieve, Paraphrase (KERP) approach which reconciles traditional knowledge- and retrieval-based methods with modern learning-based methods for accurate and robust medical report generation. Specifically, KERP decomposes medical report generation into explicit medical abnormality graph learning and subsequent natural language modeling. KERP first employs an Encode module that transforms visual features into a structured abnormality graph by incorporating prior medical knowledge; then a Retrieve module that retrieves text templates based on the detected abnormalities; and lastly, a Paraphrase module that rewrites the templates according to specific cases. The core of KERP is a proposed generic implementation unit---Graph Transformer (GTR) that dynamically transforms high-level semantics between graph-structured data of multiple domains such as knowledge graphs, images and sequences. Experiments show that the proposed approach generates structured and robust reports supported with accurate abnormality description and explainable attentive regions, achieving the state-of-the-art results on two medical report benchmarks, with the best medical abnormality and disease classification accuracy and improved human evaluation performance.",0
"Introduction Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years and has become increasingly relevant in medical image analysis tasks such as diagnosis, segmentation, localization, annotation generation, among others (1). In particular, natural language processing techniques have been successfully applied to generate automatic medical image reports using templates and keywords (2), free text dictation from radiologists (3), neural machine translation (NMT) from German to English (4), paraphrasing of sentence pairs from human annotators through semantic embeddings (5), etc. Recent advances in pre-training large transformer models on diverse data sources have led to significant improvements over these traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features, expert knowledge, and low resource requirements (6). This includes multi-modal fusion of vision and language by pre-training ViLBERT, VLFeat+ViLBERT, UNITER + external annotations of grounding boxes and attention maps (7); and LXMERT + NLP tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering, etc., then finetuning on downstream image report generation (8). All prior work solely focused on either template-based or free text generation without considering both aspects together or incorporating their strengths into a single framework for holistic report generation. Methods Here we present a novel approach called KEAPR: Knowledge Encoding and Application to Paraframing Reports (9). We use T5 pre-trained BART model architecture as our base generator due to its superior performance compared against all other baseline architectures including GPT-J, DistilBART and Hugging Face Corpus Data Sampler (9).

"We provide a new approach to training neural models to exhibit transparency in a well-defined, functional manner. Our approach naturally operates over structured data and tailors the predictor, functionally, towards a chosen family of (local) witnesses. The estimation problem is setup as a co-operative game between an unrestricted predictor such as a neural network, and a set of witnesses chosen from the desired transparent family. The goal of the witnesses is to highlight, locally, how well the predictor conforms to the chosen family of functions, while the predictor is trained to minimize the highlighted discrepancy. We emphasize that the predictor remains globally powerful as it is only encouraged to agree locally with locally adapted witnesses. We analyze the effect of the proposed approach, provide example formulations in the context of deep graph and sequence models, and empirically illustrate the idea in chemical property prediction, temporal modeling, and molecule representation learning.",0
"The goal of this study was to analyze the impact of structural data transparency on decision-making processes from a game theory perspective. We developed a model that simulates interactions between players within different types of games - cooperative, noncooperative, zero-sum, and mixed - under varying levels of functional transparency conditions. Our results show that increased levels of transparency lead to more efficient outcomes in terms of welfare gains across all game scenarios, regardless of whether they were competitive or collaborative environments. In addition, we found evidence suggesting that the effects of transparency extend beyond simple revelation of previously unknown information; actors adjust their strategies based on how others perceive them as well, resulting in positive externalities at both individual and group levels. These findings have important implications for policymakers considering mandating disclosure policies aimed at promoting transparency in industries with market power, such as financial institutions and tech companies, among others. By designing regulations that strike an optimal balance between privacy concerns and public benefit, governments can promote greater accountability while fostering better social outcomes overall.",1
"Finding an optimal parameter of a black-box function is important for searching stable material structures and finding optimal neural network structures, and Bayesian optimization algorithms are widely used for the purpose. However, most of existing Bayesian optimization algorithms can only handle vector data and cannot handle complex structured data. In this paper, we propose the topological Bayesian optimization, which can efficiently find an optimal solution from structured data using \emph{topological information}. More specifically, in order to apply Bayesian optimization to structured data, we extract useful topological information from a structure and measure the proper similarity between structures. To this end, we utilize persistent homology, which is a topological data analysis method that was recently applied in machine learning. Moreover, we propose the Bayesian optimization algorithm that can handle multiple types of topological information by using a linear combination of kernels for persistence diagrams. Through experiments, we show that topological information extracted by persistent homology contributes to a more efficient search for optimal structures compared to the random search baseline and the graph Bayesian optimization algorithm.",0
"Topological data analysis is an important tool for understanding complex datasets, particularly those containing high-dimensional or nonlinear features. One popular method of topological feature extraction is persistent homology, which allows researchers to characterize the global connectivity structure of a dataset by computing Betti numbers at different scales. These persistence diagrams can then be used as descriptors for machine learning tasks such as classification or regression. However, optimizing parameters associated with persistence diagram computations remains challenging due to their complex mathematical nature and sensitivity to noise. In this work, we present a novel approach called ""topological Bayesian optimization"" that leverages recent advances in Gaussian process priors to efficiently search parameter space using only a small number of function evaluations. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed technique on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art optimization methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our findings have implications for applications where topology must be considered alongside other factors, including computer vision, medical imaging, and materials science.",1
"We present a novel and hierarchical approach for supervised classification of signals spanning over a fixed graph, reflecting shared properties of the dataset. To this end, we introduce a Convolutional Cluster Pooling layer exploiting a multi-scale clustering in order to highlight, at different resolutions, locally connected regions on the input graph. Our proposal generalises well-established neural models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on irregular and complex domains, by means of the exploitation of the weight sharing property in a graph-oriented architecture. In this work, such property is based on the centrality of each vertex within its soft-assigned cluster. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, CIFAR-10 and 20NEWS demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in capturing both local and global patterns in graph-structured data out of different domains.",0

"A graph is a powerful concept for representation of relations between pairs of entities. Data with underlying graph structure can be found across many disciplines and there is a natural desire for understanding such data better. Deep learning (DL) has achieved significant breakthroughs in a variety of machine learning tasks in recent years, especially where data is structured on a grid, such as in text, speech, or image understanding. However, surprisingly little has been done to explore the applicability of DL on arbitrary graph-structured data directly.   The goal of this thesis is to investigate architectures for DL on graphs and study how to transfer, adapt or generalize concepts that work well on sequential and image data to this domain. We concentrate on two important primitives: embedding graphs or their nodes into a continuous vector space representation (encoding) and, conversely, generating graphs from such vectors back (decoding). To that end, we make the following contributions.   First, we introduce Edge-Conditioned Convolutions (ECC), a convolution-like operation on graphs performed in the spatial domain where filters are dynamically generated based on edge attributes. The method is used to encode graphs with arbitrary and varying structure.   Second, we propose SuperPoint Graph, an intermediate point cloud representation with rich edge attributes encoding the contextual relationship between object parts. Based on this representation, ECC is employed to segment large-scale point clouds without major sacrifice in fine details.   Third, we present GraphVAE, a graph generator allowing us to decode graphs with variable but upper-bounded number of nodes making use of approximate graph matching for aligning the predictions of an autoencoder with its inputs. The method is applied to the task of molecule generation.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has emerged as one of the most powerful techniques for analyzing complex data sets and making accurate predictions across a variety of domains. One key challenge that arises when applying these methods to large and complex datasets is how to effectively capture patterns and relationships between data points. Traditionally, this task has been addressed using graph representations, which provide a natural way to model both structural and semantic relationships within the data. However, working directly with graphs can be computationally intensive, particularly for larger datasets, leading researchers to seek alternative approaches based on embedding spaces learned via deep neural networks.  In this work, we present an approach that utilizes attributed graphs, a hybrid representation that combines traditional graph structures with additional attribute data associated with each node and edge. We explore a novel framework that applies deep learning principles to learned embeddings from such attributed graphs, allowing us to leverage their strengths while overcoming some of their limitations. Our approach involves training a convolutional neural network to learn feature representations of nodes in the graph, and then incorporating these features into a discriminative downstream machine learning algorithm to obtain high quality outputs. By doing so, we enable our method to automatically identify relevant substructures within the input graphs, significantly improving prediction accuracy over existing baseline methods. Additionally, we propose a multi-task approach that leverages both attributes and learned embeddings simultaneously, further enhancing performance. Finally, by exploiting the correspondence between graphs and their embedded representations, we develop a technique for generating new embeddings from existing ones, opening up possibilities for more flexible application scenarios. Overall, our contributions demonstrate the effectiveness of combining graph and embedding representations for improved predictive performance, highlight the promise of attributing graphs in capturing essential structure for analysis, and offer compelling evidence regarding the power of multitask learning frameworks towards driving higher levels o",1
"Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely studied for graph-structured data representation and learning. However, in many real applications, data are coming with multiple graphs, and it is non-trivial to adapt GCNs to deal with data representation with multiple graph structures. One main challenge for multi-graph representation is how to exploit both structure information of each individual graph and correlation information across multiple graphs simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel Multiple Graph Adversarial Learning (MGAL) framework for multi-graph representation and learning. MGAL aims to learn an optimal structure-invariant and consistent representation for multiple graphs in a common subspace via a novel adversarial learning framework, which thus incorporates both structure information of intra-graph and correlation information of inter-graphs simultaneously. Based on MGAL, we then provide a unified network for semi-supervised learning task. Promising experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MGAL model.",0
"Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized numerous applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause significant performance degradation by adding minimal perturbations to inputs. In response, recent research has explored defenses that focus on improving robustness against individual attack methods. This work proposes a novel approach called multiple graph adversarial learning (MGAL), which tackles adversarial examples at their source and provides end-to-end training against diverse attack methods concurrently. MGAL constructs multiple graphs during training that capture different aspects of data geometry to learn robust representations. By addressing the root cause of adversarial fragility in deep learning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses across a range of benchmark datasets and architectures while maintaining competitive accuracies. Our findings provide insights into how DNNs respond to input variations and offer new opportunities for advancing theoretical understanding of robust deep learning.",1
"Graph matching is an important and persistent problem in computer vision and pattern recognition for finding node-to-node correspondence between graph-structured data. However, as widely used, graph matching that incorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational difficulties. In this paper, we present a functional representation for graph matching (FRGM) that aims to provide more geometric insights on the problem and reduce the space and time complexities of corresponding algorithms. To achieve these goals, we represent a graph endowed with edge attributes by a linear function space equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that has an explicit geometric meaning. Consequently, the correspondence between graphs can be represented as a linear representation map of that functional. Specifically, we reformulate the linear functional representation map as a new parameterization for Euclidean graph matching, which is associative with geometric parameters for graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations. This allows us to estimate the correspondence and geometric deformations simultaneously. The use of the representation of edge attributes rather than the affinity matrix enables us to reduce the space complexity by two orders of magnitudes. Furthermore, we propose an efficient optimization strategy with low time complexity to optimize the objective function. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed FRGM can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",0
"Graph matching is a classical problem in computer science that has applications in areas such as image processing, pattern recognition, and data mining. In graph theory, two graphs G and H are considered a match if there exists a bijection f from the vertices of G to those of H which preserves edge relations. For example, if (u, v) is an edge of G, then (f(u), f(v)) should be an edge of H. In practice, graph matching is often performed using algorithms based on optimization techniques such as linear programming or dynamic programming. However, these methods can become computationally expensive for large graphs, especially when dealing with complex constraints. In addition, they may struggle to find optimal solutions when given noisy or incomplete data. To address these issues, we propose a novel functional representation for graph matching called Spectral Graphlets. This approach models each graph as a collection of overlapping subgraph patterns, or ""graphlets"", obtained by sampling the vertices at different scales. We use spectral clustering to identify natural communities within the graphlet space, allowing us to better capture the underlying structure of real-world networks. Our method efficiently maps vertex correspondences across different graphs and effectively handles missing or ambiguous edges. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and speed on both synthetic and real datasets. We believe that the proposed method has the potential to improve graph matching in many domains where efficient and effective analysis of networked data is crucial.",1
"Semi-supervised learning on graph structured data has received significant attention with the recent introduction of Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). While traditional methods have focused on optimizing a loss augmented with Laplacian regularization framework, GCNs perform an implicit Laplacian type regularization to capture local graph structure. In this work, we propose Lovasz Convolutional Network (LCNs) which are capable of incorporating global graph properties. LCNs achieve this by utilizing Lovasz's orthonormal embeddings of the nodes. We analyse local and global properties of graphs and demonstrate settings where LCNs tend to work better than GCNs. We validate the proposed method on standard random graph models such as stochastic block models (SBM) and certain community structure based graphs where LCNs outperform GCNs and learn more intuitive embeddings. We also perform extensive binary and multi-class classification experiments on real world datasets to demonstrate LCN's effectiveness. In addition to simple graphs, we also demonstrate the use of LCNs on hyper-graphs by identifying settings where they are expected to work better than GCNs.",0
"This paper presents a new method for training convolutional neural networks using Lovász function. We show that by replacing traditional batch normalization layers with Lovász normalization layers, we can achieve better generalization performance on a variety of tasks without increasing computational complexity. Our approach is based on recent theoretical results showing that Lovász functions can approximate arbitrary continuous functions well. By applying the Lovász approximation to each layer in a convolutional network, we can learn more expressive models while maintaining numerical stability. Experiments demonstrate our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets.",1
"We apply network Lasso to semi-supervised regression problems involving network structured data. This approach lends quite naturally to highly scalable learning algorithms in the form of message passing over an empirical graph which represents the network structure of the data. By using a simple non-parametric regression model, which is motivated by a clustering hypothesis, we provide an analysis of the estimation error incurred by network Lasso. This analysis reveals conditions on the the network structure and the available training data which guarantee network Lasso to be accurate. Remarkably, the accuracy of network Lasso is related to the existence of sufficiently large network flows over the empirical graph. Thus, our analysis reveals a connection between network Lasso and maximum flow problems.",0
"This paper presents an analysis of Network Lasso, a semi-supervised regression technique that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict unlabeled target variables based on partially labeled data. In recent years, GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex relationships in graphs such as social networks, citation networks, protein interaction networks, etc. However, training GNNs can often require large amounts of labeled data which may not always be available. To address these limitations, we investigate the effectiveness of Network Lasso, a method that regularizes GNN models using a sparsity-inducing penalty term derived from an additional set of unlabeled examples. Our experimental results demonstrate that Network Lasso outperforms benchmark methods including traditional machine learning techniques as well as other state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches in many real-world datasets, across various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, our study provides insights into key design choices of Network Lasso and identifies promising future research directions for semi-supervised learning in graphs. Overall, our work highlights the potential utility of Network Lasso in tackling high-dimensional problems characterized by limited labeled samples but abundant unlabeled data, making it applicable to numerous fields where graph structures play critical roles.",1
"We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning.",0
"This paper proposes ""Deep Graph Infomax"" (DGInf), a new unsupervised learning framework that utilizes graph neural networks (GNNS) to model complex relationships within data sets and maximize the mutual information (MI) between the input variables and the learned representations. DGInf operates by first mapping inputs into latent spaces using GNNS, then calculating MI between these latent codes and randomly masked versions of themselves, which forces the network to learn patterns that cannot easily be predicted from individual features alone. Through extensive experiments on real world datasets such as image classification problems, we show how DGInf leads to improved performance over other popular self-supervised methods such as BYOL, MoCo, and SimSiam while maintaining similar efficiency due to the use of random Gaussian noise instead of more expensive augmentation techniques like image rotation or jittering. Our method allows for easier hyperparameter selection and offers better results across different models ranging from ResNet-50 to larger variants. We believe this research can open up new opportunities in deep learning applications where large scale dataset collection may become prohibitive in the future, and encourage further experimentation along these lines in order to fully realize its potential benefits.",1
"The training phases of Deep neural network~(DNN) consumes enormous processing time and energy. Compression techniques utilizing the sparsity of DNNs can effectively accelerate the inference phase of DNNs. However, it can be hardly used in the training phase because the training phase involves dense matrix-multiplication using General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processors (GPGPU), which endorse regular and structural data layout. In this paper, we propose the Approximate Random Dropout that replaces the conventional random dropout of neurons and synapses with a regular and predefined patterns to eliminate the unnecessary computation and data access. To compensate the potential performance loss we develop a SGD-based Search Algorithm to produce the distribution of dropout patterns. We prove our approach is statistically equivalent to the previous dropout method. Experiments results on MLP and LSTM using well-known benchmarks show that the proposed Approximate Random Dropout can reduce the training time by $20\%$-$77\%$ ($19\%$-$60\%$) when dropout rate is $0.3$-$0.7$ on MLP (LSTM) with marginal accuracy drop.",0
"As machine learning models continue to grow larger and more complex, training and deploying these models becomes increasingly computationally expensive. One strategy for reducing computational cost is to use approximate inference methods that trade off some degree of accuracy for speed or efficiency. In this work, we propose a new method called Approximate Random Dropout (ARD), which extends the popular technique of random dropout used during training by introducing additional variability at test time. ARD randomly drops out neurons during both training and testing, but uses different rates of dropping out depending on the size of the model and desired level of approximation. We evaluate the performance of ARD on several benchmark datasets and show that it can achieve comparable results to full precision inference while significantly improving computational efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach is robust against adversarial attacks, making it an attractive option for deployment in security-critical applications. Overall, ARD offers a flexible and effective solution for enabling fast and accurate machine learning models on resource constrained devices or cloud services with limited computing resources.",1

Finally, we conclude by highlighting some future directions for research on GANs with graph structures.",1
"Tensor network decomposition, originated from quantum physics to model entangled many-particle quantum systems, turns out to be a promising mathematical technique to efficiently represent and process big data in parsimonious manner. In this study, we show that tensor networks can systematically partition structured data, e.g. color images, for distributed storage and communication in privacy-preserving manner. Leveraging the sea of big data and metadata privacy, empirical results show that neighbouring subtensors with implicit information stored in tensor network formats cannot be identified for data reconstruction. This technique complements the existing encryption and randomization techniques which store explicit data representation at one place and highly susceptible to adversarial attacks such as side-channel attacks and de-anonymization. Furthermore, we propose a theory for adversarial examples that mislead convolutional neural networks to misclassification using subspace analysis based on singular value decomposition (SVD). The theory is extended to analyze higher-order tensors using tensor-train SVD (TT-SVD); it helps to explain the level of susceptibility of different datasets to adversarial attacks, the structural similarity of different adversarial attacks including global and localized attacks, and the efficacy of different adversarial defenses based on input transformation. An efficient and adaptive algorithm based on robust TT-SVD is then developed to detect strong and static adversarial attacks.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to convolutional neural network (CNN) design that utilizes transformed input data instead of raw pixel values. By applying transformations such as rotation and scaling to the input images before feeding them into the CNN, we can improve the robustness and generalization performance of the model. We demonstrate this through experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing improved accuracy compared to traditional CNN architectures using untransformed inputs. Additionally, we propose a method for decomposing the tensor representations of the transformed input data into lower-dimensional tensors, which allows us to further reduce the computational complexity of training and testing while maintaining high levels of accuracy. Our results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating transformation preprocessing techniques into CNN architecture design.",1
"Structural health monitoring is a condition-based field of study utilised to monitor infrastructure, via sensing systems. It is therefore used in the field of aerospace engineering to assist in monitoring the health of aerospace structures. A difficulty however is that in structural health monitoring the data input is usually from sensor arrays, which results in data which are highly redundant and correlated, an area in which traditional two-way matrix approaches have had difficulty in deconstructing and interpreting. Newer methods involving tensor analysis allow us to analyse this multi-way structural data in a coherent manner.

"This paper presents a novel approach to structural health monitoring (SHM) for aeroservoelastic systems using tensor techniques. SHM plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and reliability of aircraft structures, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, traditional methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially when dealing with complex dynamic interactions between aerodynamic forces, flexible dynamics, and control actions. In this work, we propose a new method based on tensors that can handle these complex interactions effectively and provide accurate diagnostics of damage and faults in real time. Our approach uses both sensor measurements and mathematical models to construct a tensor representation of the system state space. This representation captures all relevant information including modal parameters, loadings, airspeed, and other environmental factors. We then use tensor decompositions such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), and Tensor PCA (TPCA) to extract meaningful features from the data and identify anomalies indicative of damage or faults. Our results show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches in detecting and locating damages under different scenarios and configurations. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential benefits of using tensor techniques in advancing SHM for aeroservoelastic systems.",1
"Graph-based methods are known to be successful in many machine learning and pattern classification tasks. These methods consider semi-structured data as graphs where nodes correspond to primitives (parts, interest points, segments, etc.) and edges characterize the relationships between these primitives. However, these non-vectorial graph data cannot be straightforwardly plugged into off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms without a preliminary step of -- explicit/implicit -- graph vectorization and embedding. This embedding process should be resilient to intra-class graph variations while being highly discriminant. In this paper, we propose a novel high-order stochastic graphlet embedding (SGE) that maps graphs into vector spaces. Our main contribution includes a new stochastic search procedure that efficiently parses a given graph and extracts/samples unlimitedly high-order graphlets. We consider these graphlets, with increasing orders, to model local primitives as well as their increasingly complex interactions. In order to build our graph representation, we measure the distribution of these graphlets into a given graph, using particular hash functions that efficiently assign sampled graphlets into isomorphic sets with a very low probability of collision. When combined with maximum margin classifiers, these graphlet-based representations have positive impact on the performance of pattern comparison and recognition as corroborated through extensive experiments using standard benchmark databases.",0
"This paper introduces stochastic graphlet embedding (SGE), which enables efficient computation of node embeddings that capture local structural features of graphs. SGE extends the deterministic graphlet decomposition introduced by Milo et al., but replaces all-or-nothing patterns with stochastically sampled subgraphs. We then define Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to randomly walk across these stochastic graphlets, allowing us to assign high-quality continuous vector representations directly to nodes in arbitrary complex networks, scalably. Using synthetic and real data sets of different sizes and types we show that our approach works well on graphs of very diverse nature. In particular, results obtained via node embeddings derived from stochastic graphlets perform as well as the widely used DeepWalk method, while scaling at least two orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, we demonstrate how we can leverage these embeddings for downstream analytics like semi-supervised link prediction and anomaly detection. With this work we aim to foster research into network analysis using machine learning and more broadly help make such techniques applicable to big data problems.",1
"Recently, techniques for applying convolutional neural networks to graph-structured data have emerged. Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have been used to address node and graph classification and matrix completion. Although the performance has been impressive, the current implementations have limited capability to incorporate uncertainty in the graph structure. Almost all GCNNs process a graph as though it is a ground-truth depiction of the relationship between nodes, but often the graphs employed in applications are themselves derived from noisy data or modelling assumptions. Spurious edges may be included; other edges may be missing between nodes that have very strong relationships. In this paper we adopt a Bayesian approach, viewing the observed graph as a realization from a parametric family of random graphs. We then target inference of the joint posterior of the random graph parameters and the node (or graph) labels. We present the Bayesian GCNN framework and develop an iterative learning procedure for the case of assortative mixed-membership stochastic block models. We present the results of experiments that demonstrate that the Bayesian formulation can provide better performance when there are very few labels available during the training process.",0
"Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising technique that enables the use of large amounts of unlabeled data to improve performance on supervised tasks. In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have shown state-of-the-art results for many applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. However, the traditional GCN training relies heavily on labeled data, which can become impractical or expensive to obtain. This work presents a novel approach based on Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling for training GCN models using both labeled and unlabeled data. We propose a novel method to approximate the evidence lower bound by iterative denoising of the data, combined with variational inference over the model parameters. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, achieving significant improvements over baseline methods on several benchmark datasets across different domains.

"Spectral Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a generalization of convolutional networks to learning on graph-structured data. Applications of spectral GCNs have been successful, but limited to a few problems where the graph is fixed, such as shape correspondence and node classification. In this work, we address this limitation by revisiting a particular family of spectral graph networks, Chebyshev GCNs, showing its efficacy in solving graph classification tasks with a variable graph structure and size. Chebyshev GCNs restrict graphs to have at most one edge between any pair of nodes. To this end, we propose a novel multigraph network that learns from multi-relational graphs. We model learned edges with abstract meaning and experiment with different ways to fuse the representations extracted from annotated and learned edges, achieving competitive results on a variety of chemical classification benchmarks.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, advancements in machine learning have enabled the development of novel approaches for discovering relationships in molecular data. One such approach involves using spectral multigraph networks to represent complex chemical structures and analyze their underlying patterns. These networks enable the discovery of both local and global relationships within molecules, allowing for more effective analysis and understanding of molecular behavior. By fusing these relationships together, researchers can gain deeper insights into the structural, physical, and chemical properties of molecules. This work presents a comprehensive overview of spectral multigraph networks, highlighting their applications in discovering and fusing relationships in molecular systems. We discuss several case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods and provide suggestions for future directions in this exciting field.",1
"Link prediction is a key problem for network-structured data. Link prediction heuristics use some score functions, such as common neighbors and Katz index, to measure the likelihood of links. They have obtained wide practical uses due to their simplicity, interpretability, and for some of them, scalability. However, every heuristic has a strong assumption on when two nodes are likely to link, which limits their effectiveness on networks where these assumptions fail. In this regard, a more reasonable way should be learning a suitable heuristic from a given network instead of using predefined ones. By extracting a local subgraph around each target link, we aim to learn a function mapping the subgraph patterns to link existence, thus automatically learning a `heuristic' that suits the current network. In this paper, we study this heuristic learning paradigm for link prediction. First, we develop a novel $\gamma$-decaying heuristic theory. The theory unifies a wide range of heuristics in a single framework, and proves that all these heuristics can be well approximated from local subgraphs. Our results show that local subgraphs reserve rich information related to link existence. Second, based on the $\gamma$-decaying theory, we propose a new algorithm to learn heuristics from local subgraphs using a graph neural network (GNN). Its experimental results show unprecedented performance, working consistently well on a wide range of problems.",0

"Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has gained tremendous success in computer vision tasks with its outstanding ability to capture the local latent features. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in extending convolution operations to the non-Euclidean geometry. Although various types of convolution operations have been proposed for graphs or manifolds, their connections with traditional convolution over grid-structured data are not well-understood. In this paper, we show that depthwise separable convolution can be successfully generalized for the unification of both graph-based and grid-based convolution methods. Based on this insight we propose a novel Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution (DSGC) approach which is compatible with the tradition convolution network and subsumes existing convolution methods as special cases. It is equipped with the combined strengths in model expressiveness, compatibility (relatively small number of parameters), modularity and computational efficiency in training. Extensive experiments show the outstanding performance of DSGC in comparison with strong baselines on multi-domain benchmark datasets.",0
"Deep learning has been successful on a variety of tasks in recent years, thanks in part to advancements in the architecture design and optimization techniques such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) [1]. To improve results further, more expressive models need to be developed that can capture higher level abstractions through hierarchical composition of primitive operations, which would enable building more complex, yet interpretable models able to perform challenging tasks under limited supervision or even without explicit annotations [2] [3]. Motivated by these observations, we introduce here the first attempt to learn depthwise separable graph convolution operators directly from data using a deep neural network trained end-to-end using backpropagation (dubbed DGNN). Our framework makes use of the recent progress in implicit regularization obtained via randomized ensembles to achieve improved generalizability of the learned model parameters to unseen test cases [4], allowing training without strong inductive biases towards specific task families. We demonstrate high fidelity to the original task while making significant improvements over baselines on several real world datasets taken from multiple domains.

"Graphs are essential representations of many real-world data such as social networks. Recent years have witnessed the increasing efforts made to extend the neural network models to graph-structured data. These methods, which are usually known as the graph neural networks, have been applied to advance many graphs related tasks such as reasoning dynamics of the physical system, graph classification, and node classification. Most of the existing graph neural network models have been designed for static graphs, while many real-world graphs are inherently dynamic. For example, social networks are naturally evolving as new users joining and new relations being created. Current graph neural network models cannot utilize the dynamic information in dynamic graphs. However, the dynamic information has been proven to enhance the performance of many graph analytic tasks such as community detection and link prediction. Hence, it is necessary to design dedicated graph neural networks for dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DGNN, a new {\bf D}ynamic {\bf G}raph {\bf N}eural {\bf N}etwork model, which can model the dynamic information as the graph evolving. In particular, the proposed framework can keep updating node information by capturing the sequential information of edges (interactions), the time intervals between edges and information propagation coherently. Experimental results on various dynamic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex relationships and patterns on graphs.

To address these limitations, we propose the use of streaming graph neural networks that process data online in real-time using incremental updates. Our approach leverages incremental learning techniques commonly used in stream mining systems but tailored specifically for GNNs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art batch baselines while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Overall, our work shows great potential for enabling GNN models to handle streaming data, opening up new possibilities for their deployment in diverse domains such as sensor network analysis, social media monitoring, and financial transactions tracking.",1
"With the expeditious advancement of information technologies, health-related data presented unprecedented potentials for medical and health discoveries but at the same time significant challenges for machine learning techniques both in terms of size and complexity.

In addition, traditional methods used to train probabilistic models can be computationally expensive and require significant computational resources. This study aimed to develop an efficient method for learning probabilistic models from longitudinal datasets by addressing these challenges. Our proposed method was evaluated on three different clinical datasets demonstrating improved accuracy over existing approaches while requiring significantly less computational time.

The core ingredient of our model is a new class of parametric rational complex functions (Cayley polynomials) allowing to efficiently compute spectral filters on graphs that specialize on frequency bands of interest. Our model generates rich spectral filters that are localized in space, scales linearly with the size of the input data for sparsely-connected graphs, and can handle different constructions of Laplacian operators.

"Using predictive models to identify patterns that can act as biomarkers for different neuropathoglogical conditions is becoming highly prevalent. In this paper, we consider the problem of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classification where previous work has shown that it can be beneficial to incorporate a wide variety of meta features, such as socio-cultural traits, into predictive modeling. A graph-based approach naturally suits these scenarios, where a contextual graph captures traits that characterize a population, while the specific brain activity patterns are utilized as a multivariate signal at the nodes. Graph neural networks have shown improvements in inferencing with graph-structured data. Though the underlying graph strongly dictates the overall performance, there exists no systematic way of choosing an appropriate graph in practice, thus making predictive models non-robust. To address this, we propose a bootstrapped version of graph convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) that utilizes an ensemble of weakly trained G-CNNs, and reduce the sensitivity of models on the choice of graph construction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset and show that our approach improves upon recently proposed graph-based neural networks. We also show that our method remains more robust to noisy graphs.",0
"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects many individuals worldwide. Traditional methods like questionnaires and medical assessments often result in delayed diagnoses due to subjectivity and limited accessibility. Recently, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as promising models for classifying ASD using structured data sets, such as brain functional connectomes. However, applying GCNNs on these large-scale datasets can be challenging because they require substantial computational resources that may not always be available. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping approach to efficiently train GCNNs for accurate classification of ASD. Methods: We utilized resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data from a publicly available dataset containing both healthy controls and children with ASD. Our bootstrapped model consists of three components: i) building small subsets from large rsfMRI datasets by randomly selecting samples with replacement, ii) training a lightweight model on the subset of each sampled brain network, and iii) aggregating predictions across multiple runs with different random samplings to produce a final prediction. Results: Compared to traditional full-dataset approaches, our method achieved higher accuracy and better balanced performance measures while requiring significantly less computation time and memory usage. Additionally, we demonstrate how this new approach enables us to make more precise predictions than previously reported work in the literature by performing thorough cross-validation experiments. Discussion: This research contributes to addressing crucial limitations faced by current clinical practices used for ASD diagnosis through innovative machine learning techniques applied to rsMRI analysis. Our bootstrapped GCNN framework offers several advantages over existing models: improved efficiency, accuracy, and scalability without sacrificing model performance. By providing accurate predictions at lower costs, our method has potential to enhance patient outcomes through earlier diagnoses and m",1
"Algebraic topology methods have recently played an important role for statistical analysis with complicated geometric structured data such as shapes, linked twist maps, and material data. Among them, \textit{persistent homology} is a well-known tool to extract robust topological features, and outputs as \textit{persistence diagrams} (PDs). However, PDs are point multi-sets which can not be used in machine learning algorithms for vector data. To deal with it, an emerged approach is to use kernel methods, and an appropriate geometry for PDs is an important factor to measure the similarity of PDs. A popular geometry for PDs is the \textit{Wasserstein metric}. However, Wasserstein distance is not \textit{negative definite}. Thus, it is limited to build positive definite kernels upon the Wasserstein distance \textit{without approximation}. In this work, we rely upon the alternative \textit{Fisher information geometry} to propose a positive definite kernel for PDs \textit{without approximation}, namely the Persistence Fisher (PF) kernel. Then, we analyze eigensystem of the integral operator induced by the proposed kernel for kernel machines. Based on that, we derive generalization error bounds via covering numbers and Rademacher averages for kernel machines with the PF kernel. Additionally, we show some nice properties such as stability and infinite divisibility for the proposed kernel. Furthermore, we also propose a linear time complexity over the number of points in PDs for an approximation of our proposed kernel with a bounded error. Throughout experiments with many different tasks on various benchmark datasets, we illustrate that the PF kernel compares favorably with other baseline kernels for PDs.",0
"In this work, we introduce the concept of Persistence Fisher kernels (P FK), which extend classical kernel methods such as Gaussian processes to handle persistence diagrams and other data sets defined on a Riemannian manifold. These kernels provide a natural tool for machine learning and statistical analysis tasks involving geometric invariants of objects, like shapes, flows, and functions. We prove that under certain assumptions, P Fk is equivalent to kernels based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) function but has advantages over competing approaches in terms of computational complexity and memory usage. Furthermore, our method can effectively capture geometric features of persistence diagrams, demonstrating its efficacy through experiments conducted both on synthetic datasets and real-world applications including shape classification and feature extraction problems from image processing tasks. By providing a reliable and efficient approach applicable to complex real-life scenarios, our findings have important implications for the fields of computer vision, topological data analysis, and more broadly, the study of nonlinear manifolds using kernel techniques.",1
"Neural networks have been shown to be an effective tool for learning algorithms over graph-structured data. However, graph representation techniques---that convert graphs to real-valued vectors for use with neural networks---are still in their infancy. Recent works have proposed several approaches (e.g., graph convolutional networks), but these methods have difficulty scaling and generalizing to graphs with different sizes and shapes. We present Graph2Seq, a new technique that represents vertices of graphs as infinite time-series. By not limiting the representation to a fixed dimension, Graph2Seq scales naturally to graphs of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Graph2Seq is also reversible, allowing full recovery of the graph structure from the sequences. By analyzing a formal computational model for graph representation, we show that an unbounded sequence is necessary for scalability. Our experimental results with Graph2Seq show strong generalization and new state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph combinatorial optimization problems.",0

Experiments on semi-supervised learning tasks on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the better performance of the proposed GDEN when comparing with the traditional GCN models.",0
"This paper introduces a novel deep learning method called Graph Diffusion-Embedding Network (GDEN) for learning node representations from large-scale complex networks such as graphs. GDEN uses graph diffusion techniques to learn low-dimensional embeddings that capture both structural and attribute information of nodes in the network. These embeddings can then be used for downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or link prediction. Unlike traditional embedding methods like Node2Vec and DeepWalk which only use random walks, GDEN utilizes a combination of random walk, shortest path matrix factorization, and personalized PageRank matrices to generate multiple scales of temporal information. By using these different diffusion models, GDEN captures a more comprehensive representation of the network structure, allowing for better performance on node classification tasks compared to other state-of-the-art baseline models. Overall, our approach provides a scalable solution for embedding extraction and opens new directions towards better understanding and analyzing massive real-world systems.",1
"Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN) has been widely used for semi-supervised classification and deep feature representation on graph-structured data. However, existing GCN generally fails to consider the local invariance constraint in learning and representation process. That is, if two data points Xi and Xj are close in the intrinsic geometry of the data distribution, then their labels/representations should also be close to each other. This is known as local invariance assumption which plays an essential role in the development of various kinds of traditional algorithms, such as dimensionality reduction and semi-supervised learning, in machine learning area. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a graph Laplacian GCN (gLGCN) approach for graph data representation and semi-supervised classification. The proposed gLGCN model is capable of encoding both graph structure and node features together while maintains the local invariance constraint naturally for robust data representation and semi-supervised classification. Experiments show the benefit of the benefits the proposed gLGCN network.",0
"In recent years, semi-supervised learning has become increasingly important due to the scarcity of labeled data.

"Deep learning systems extensively use convolution operations to process input data. Though convolution is clearly defined for structured data such as 2D images or 3D volumes, this is not true for other data types such as sparse point clouds. Previous techniques have developed approximations to convolutions for restricted conditions. Unfortunately, their applicability is limited and cannot be used for general point clouds. We propose an efficient and effective method to learn convolutions for non-uniformly sampled point clouds, as they are obtained with modern acquisition techniques. Learning is enabled by four key novelties: first, representing the convolution kernel itself as a multilayer perceptron; second, phrasing convolution as a Monte Carlo integration problem, third, using this notion to combine information from multiple samplings at different levels; and fourth using Poisson disk sampling as a scalable means of hierarchical point cloud learning. The key idea across all these contributions is to guarantee adequate consideration of the underlying non-uniform sample distribution function from a Monte Carlo perspective. To make the proposed concepts applicable to real-world tasks, we furthermore propose an efficient implementation which significantly reduces the GPU memory required during the training process. By employing our method in hierarchical network architectures we can outperform most of the state-of-the-art networks on established point cloud segmentation, classification and normal estimation benchmarks. Furthermore, in contrast to most existing approaches, we also demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to sampling variations, even when training with uniformly sampled data only. To support the direct application of these concepts, we provide a ready-to-use TensorFlow implementation of these layers at https://github.com/viscom-ulm/MCCNN",0
"In the field of computer vision, point clouds have become increasingly important as they provide highly detailed three-dimensional representations of real world scenes. However, due to the high computational cost of working directly on these dense data sets, researchers often resort to downsampling techniques that reduce the number of points while attempting to retain relevant features. In practice, such methods can lead to severe loss of information or even render certain applications impossible if applied without care. To address these issues, we present a novel framework based on Monte Carlo integration which offers provably better convergence rates than competing methods, as well as flexibility regarding sampling patterns that allows customized tradeoffs between sparsity, speedup gains, and accuracy retention. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach through extensive evaluation across multiple tasks, including semantic segmentation, surface reconstruction, and scene classification. Our results show consistent improvements over existing approaches, particularly for non-uniformly sampled inputs where state-of-the-art methods fail to perform adequately. Overall, our work provides new insights into how machine learning models operating on raw point cloud data can achieve superior performance by leveraging judicious sparsification strategies derived from principles underlying modern numerical analysis.",1

As only a subset of IceCube's sensors is active during a given observation, we note the adaptive nature of our GNN, wherein computation is restricted to the input signal support. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GNN architecture on a task classifying IceCube events, where it outperforms both a traditional physics-based method as well as classical 3D convolution neural networks.",0

We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and transformers. Results show that GNN outperforms CNN while performing comparably to LSTM and transformer architectures across various benchmark datasets representative of IceCube signal scenarios. These findings suggest that GNN can serve as effective models for processing complex spatio-temporal data generated by neutrino detectors like IceCube. Further studies may explore applying graph partitioning strategies to reduce computational requirements during inference or training phases.",1
"Visual relationship detection can bridge the gap between computer vision and natural language for scene understanding of images. Different from pure object recognition tasks, the relation triplets of subject-predicate-object lie on an extreme diversity space, such as \textit{person-behind-person} and \textit{car-behind-building}, while suffering from the problem of combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we propose a context-dependent diffusion network (CDDN) framework to deal with visual relationship detection. To capture the interactions of different object instances, two types of graphs, word semantic graph and visual scene graph, are constructed to encode global context interdependency. The semantic graph is built through language priors to model semantic correlations across objects, whilst the visual scene graph defines the connections of scene objects so as to utilize the surrounding scene information. For the graph-structured data, we design a diffusion network to adaptively aggregate information from contexts, which can effectively learn latent representations of visual relationships and well cater to visual relationship detection in view of its isomorphic invariance to graphs. Experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is more effective and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",0

"Machine Learning on graph-structured data is an important and omnipresent task for a vast variety of applications including anomaly detection and dynamic network analysis. In this paper, a deep generative model is introduced to capture continuous probability densities corresponding to the nodes of an arbitrary graph. In contrast to all learning formulations in the area of discriminative pattern recognition, we propose a scalable generative optimization/algorithm theoretically proved to capture distributions at the nodes of a graph. Our model is able to generate samples from the probability densities learned at each node. This probabilistic data generation model, i.e. convolutional graph auto-encoder (CGAE), is devised based on the localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, deep learning, and the variational Bayesian inference. We apply our CGAE to a new problem, the spatio-temporal probabilistic solar irradiance prediction. Multiple solar radiation measurement sites in a wide area in northern states of the US are modeled as an undirected graph. Using our proposed model, the distribution of future irradiance given historical radiation observations is estimated for every site/node. Numerical results on the National Solar Radiation Database show state-of-the-art performance for probabilistic radiation prediction on geographically distributed irradiance data in terms of reliability, sharpness, and continuous ranked probability score.",0
"This paper presents a deep generative neural architecture called ""Convolutional Graph Auto-Encoder"" (CGAE) for spatio-temporal forecasting of solar irradiance at high resolutions. In our approach, we use convolutional graphs as input data representations instead of raw images, which allows us to effectively capture spatial dependencies using graph convolutional networks. We then employ a variational auto-encoder framework to learn probabilistic generative models that can accurately predict future solar radiation patterns over a given area. Our method addresses several shortcomings associated with current state-of-the-art approaches used for solar irradiance forecasting such as limited accuracy due to simplistic assumptions like linearity and stationarity. Furthermore, CGAEs can generate multiple plausible predictions allowing decision makers to evaluate alternative scenarios before committing resources. Our results indicate significant improvements in accuracy compared to other techniques on real world datasets from four different geographical regions around the globe. Therefore, we believe that CGAE is well positioned to revolutionize how future solar irradiance is estimated within the renewable energy domain.",1

"Title: ""RetGK: Graph Kernels based on Return Probabilities of Random Walks""  Abstract: In recent years, graph kernels have become increasingly popular as a method for comparing graphs. These methods typically use various types of graph features, such as node degree distributions or subgraph frequencies, which can then be used to calculate pairwise similarity scores. However, most existing graph kernels suffer from drawbacks such as high computational cost, poor scalability, or sensitivity to noise in the input data. To address these issues, we propose RetGK, a new type of graph kernel that uses return probabilities obtained from random walks on graphs. Our approach has several advantages over traditional graph kernels. First, it requires only local information about each individual graph, making it computationally efficient and easily parallelizable. Second, it can effectively handle graphs with different sizes, structures, and scales while maintaining good performance across all cases. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed kernel outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, providing robust comparisons of graph pairs. Overall, RetGK offers a powerful tool for graph comparison, opening up new opportunities in fields like image analysis, bioinformatics, social network analysis, and beyond. Title: ""RetGK: Graph Kernels Based on Return Probabilities of Random Walks"" ===============================================  In many applications such as graph classification, anomaly detection, and feature learning, there is a need for accurate and efficient algorithms that compare graphs.

"Recursive neural networks have widely been used by researchers to handle applications with recursively or hierarchically structured data. However, embedded control flow deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe2, and MXNet fail to efficiently represent and execute such neural networks, due to lack of support for recursion. In this paper, we add recursion to the programming model of existing frameworks by complementing their design with recursive execution of dataflow graphs as well as additional APIs for recursive definitions. Unlike iterative implementations, which can only understand the topological index of each node in recursive data structures, our recursive implementation is able to exploit the recursive relationships between nodes for efficient execution based on parallel computation. We present an implementation on TensorFlow and evaluation results with various recursive neural network models, showing that our recursive implementation not only conveys the recursive nature of recursive neural networks better than other implementations, but also uses given resources more effectively to reduce training and inference time.",0
"Title: ""Recursive Computations in Neural Networks"" Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular over recent years due to their ability to handle complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, these models can often suffer from limited expressivity, which hinders their performance on more challenging problems. One approach to improve the expressive power of neural networks is by incorporating recursion into the model architecture itself. By allowing computations within the network to reference themselves, we can enable the learning of compositional representations that capture hierarchical structures present in many domains. In this work, we propose novel deep learning frameworks that explicitly account for recursive operations through the use of symbolic computation graphs. Our methods allow us to learn more effective neural networks that are capable of handling diverse real-world applications, including sequence transduction and generative tasks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches against state-of-the-art baselines across several benchmark datasets, highlighting the importance of enriched representational capacity in achieving superior generalization results. This research represents a significant step towards developing powerful artificial intelligence systems that possess human-level problem-solving abilities.",1
"Feature selection, as a data preprocessing strategy, has been proven to be effective and efficient in preparing data (especially high-dimensional data) for various data mining and machine learning problems. The objectives of feature selection include: building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity based, information theoretical based, sparse learning based and statistical based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open-source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (\url{http://featureselection.asu.edu/}). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.",0

Traditional methods often relied upon expert knowledge or manual feature selection based on domain understanding. With growing amounts of available data, these approaches have become less feasible. This article provides a comprehensive overview of modern techniques used for automatic feature selection, specifically those rooted within the field of machine learning. Techniques such as filter methods like chi-square mutual information criteria, correlation ratio features, recursive feature elimination; embedding methods including principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA); and regularization-based methods like LASSO and Ridge regression are discussed at length. Additionally, we explore their advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses, and potential applications in different domains. Our goal is to provide practitioners with insights into how to approach applying appropriate methodologies for specific datasets and problems.

"Important advances have been made using convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches to solve complicated problems in areas that rely on grid structured data such as image processing and object classification. Recently, research on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) has increased dramatically as researchers try to replicate the success of CNN for graph structured data. Unfortunately, traditional CNN methods are not readily transferable to GCNN, given the irregularity and geometric complexity of graphs. The emerging field of GCNN is further complicated by research papers that differ greatly in their scope, detail, and level of academic sophistication needed by the reader.   The present paper provides a review of some basic properties of GCNN. As a guide to the interested reader, recent examples of GCNN research are then grouped according to techniques that attempt to uncover the underlying topology of the graph model and those that seek to generalize traditional CNN methods on graph data to improve prediction of class membership. Discrete Signal Processing on Graphs (DSPg) is used as a theoretical framework to better understand some of the performance gains and limitations of these recent GCNN approaches. A brief discussion of Topology Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks (TAGCN) is presented as an approach motivated by DSPg and future research directions using this approach are briefly discussed.",0
"The abstract should summarize key findings and contributions of the paper. The paper presents state-of-the-art research on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN). Title: Topology and Prediction Focused Research on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. Graph convolutional neural networks have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to model complex graphs and perform well on tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, there remain several open questions regarding how to optimize these models and make use of their unique properties. In our work, we address some of these challenges by investigating two important aspects of GCNNs - topology and prediction. Specifically, we explore ways in which understanding graph structure can improve predictions made by these models, as well as methods for incorporating prior knowledge into the training process. Our results demonstrate that carefully considering both topological features and prediction objectives leads to improved performance across a range of applications. Moreover, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying these improvements, enabling future work in this area to build upon our findings.

"Early detection of preventable diseases is important for better disease management, improved inter-ventions, and more efficient health-care resource allocation. Various machine learning approacheshave been developed to utilize information in Electronic Health Record (EHR) for this task. Majorityof previous attempts, however, focus on structured fields and lose the vast amount of information inthe unstructured notes. In this work we propose a general multi-task framework for disease onsetprediction that combines both free-text medical notes and structured information. We compareperformance of different deep learning architectures including CNN, LSTM and hierarchical models.In contrast to traditional text-based prediction models, our approach does not require disease specificfeature engineering, and can handle negations and numerical values that exist in the text.

Our method uses a deep learning model called a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to identify relevant features present within electronic health records that can contribute to a patient’s likelihood of developing such conditions. By incorporating temporal dependency information into the analysis of clinical narratives we aim to improve upon existing methods which rely solely on static features extracted from free text data. To evaluate our approach we perform experiments on two distinct datasets collected from hospitals affiliated with leading academic institutions. Experimental results show significant improvements over competitive baselines and demonstrate the potential value offered by these models for informing early intervention strategies. We believe that approaches like ours have great promise towards improving patient care through more proactive management of chronic disease risk factors.",1
"We apply the network Lasso to solve binary classification and clustering problems for network-structured data. To this end, we generalize ordinary logistic regression to non-Euclidean data with an intrinsic network structure. The resulting ""logistic network Lasso"" amounts to solving a non-smooth convex regularized empirical risk minimization. The risk is measured using the logistic loss incurred over a small set of labeled nodes. For the regularization, we propose to use the total variation of the classifier requiring it to conform to the underlying network structure. A scalable implementation of the learning method is obtained using an inexact variant of the alternating direction methods of multipliers which results in a scalable learning algorithm",0
"Title: ""The Power of Multi-scale Learning for Graph Regularization""  Abstract:  Regularization techniques have become essential tools for achieving state-of-the-art performance on graph-related tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and visual representation learning. Among these methods, logistic network lasso (LL) has emerged as a promising approach due to its ability to capture multi-scale relationships within graphs while minimizing overfitting. However, recent work suggests that LL may suffer from limitations related to computational complexity, scalability, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel framework called multi-scale graph regularization networks (MGRNs), which addresses these challenges by incorporating hierarchical proximal gradient optimization into the training process. Our experiments demonstrate that MGRNs outperform existing alternatives on several benchmark datasets across different evaluation metrics. We provide analysis and insights into how our model leverages multi-scale learning to identify informative features and significantly improve generalizability compared to baseline models, making it a competitive choice for addressing complex graph problems in real-world scenarios. Overall, we believe our findings contribute new ideas towards advancing graph neural networks research and broadening their application domains.",1
"We study instancewise feature importance scoring as a method for model interpretation. Any such method yields, for each predicted instance, a vector of importance scores associated with the feature vector. Methods based on the Shapley score have been proposed as a fair way of computing feature attributions of this kind, but incur an exponential complexity in the number of features. This combinatorial explosion arises from the definition of the Shapley value and prevents these methods from being scalable to large data sets and complex models. We focus on settings in which the data have a graph structure, and the contribution of features to the target variable is well-approximated by a graph-structured factorization. In such settings, we develop two algorithms with linear complexity for instancewise feature importance scoring. We establish the relationship of our methods to the Shapley value and another closely related concept known as the Myerson value from cooperative game theory. We demonstrate on both language and image data that our algorithms compare favorably with other methods for model interpretation.",0

"The latent feature relational model (LFRM) is a generative model for graph-structured data to learn a binary vector representation for each node in the graph. The binary vector denotes the node's membership in one or more communities. At its core, the LFRM miller2009nonparametric is an overlapping stochastic blockmodel, which defines the link probability between any pair of nodes as a bilinear function of their community membership vectors. Moreover, using a nonparametric Bayesian prior (Indian Buffet Process) enables learning the number of communities automatically from the data. However, despite its appealing properties, inference in LFRM remains a challenge and is typically done via MCMC methods. This can be slow and may take a long time to converge. In this work, we develop a small-variance asymptotics based framework for the non-parametric Bayesian LFRM. This leads to an objective function that retains the nonparametric Bayesian flavor of LFRM, while enabling us to design deterministic inference algorithms for this model, that are easy to implement (using generic or specialized optimization routines) and are fast in practice. Our results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive to methods such as MCMC, while being much faster.",0

"Numerous pattern recognition applications can be formed as learning from graph-structured data, including social network, protein-interaction network, the world wide web data, knowledge graph, etc. While convolutional neural network (CNN) facilitates great advances in gridded image/video understanding tasks, very limited attention has been devoted to transform these successful network structures (including Inception net, Residual net, Dense net, etc.) to establish convolutional networks on graph, due to its irregularity and complexity geometric topologies (unordered vertices, unfixed number of adjacent edges/vertices). In this paper, we aim to give a comprehensive analysis of when work matters by transforming different classical network structures to graph CNN, particularly in the basic graph recognition problem. Specifically, we firstly review the general graph CNN methods, especially in its spectral filtering operation on the irregular graph data. We then introduce the basic structures of ResNet, Inception and DenseNet into graph CNN and construct these network structures on graph, named as G_ResNet, G_Inception, G_DenseNet. In particular, it seeks to help graph CNNs by shedding light on how these classical network structures work and providing guidelines for choosing appropriate graph network frameworks.

"Recent advances in graph convolutional networks have significantly improved the performance of chemical predictions, raising a new research question: ""how do we explain the predictions of graph convolutional networks?"" A possible approach to answer this question is to visualize evidence substructures responsible for the predictions. For chemical property prediction tasks, the sample size of the training data is often small and/or a label imbalance problem occurs, where a few samples belong to a single class and the majority of samples belong to the other classes. This can lead to uncertainty related to the learned parameters of the machine learning model. To address this uncertainty, we propose BayesGrad, utilizing the Bayesian predictive distribution, to define the importance of each node in an input graph, which is computed efficiently using the dropout technique. We demonstrate that BayesGrad successfully visualizes the substructures responsible for the label prediction in the artificial experiment, even when the sample size is small. Furthermore, we use a real dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization. The basic idea of BayesGrad is not limited to graph-structured data and can be applied to other data types.",0

We evaluate our technique on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it effectively identifies the most important inputs driving a given prediction, while offering substantial speedup over competing approaches. Overall, our work provides researchers and practitioners with a more transparent understanding of GCN behavior, which is crucial for realizing their full potential across diverse applications.",1
"Fashion preference is a fuzzy concept that depends on customer taste, prevailing norms in fashion product/style, henceforth used interchangeably, and a customer's perception of utility or fashionability, yet fashion e-retail relies on algorithmically generated search and recommendation systems that process structured data and images to best match customer preference. Retailers study tastes solely as a function of what sold vs what did not, and take it to represent customer preference. Such explicit modeling, however, belies the underlying user preference, which is a complicated interplay of preference and commercials such as brand, price point, promotions, other sale events, and competitor push/marketing. It is hard to infer a notion of utility or even customer preference by looking at sales data.   In search and recommendation systems for fashion e-retail, customer preference is implicitly derived by user-user similarity or item-item similarity. In this work, we aim to derive a metric that separates the buying preferences of users from the commercials of the merchandise (price, promotions, etc). We extend our earlier work on explicit signals to gauge sellability or preference with implicit signals from user behaviour.",0
"In today's fast-paced world, fashion plays an important role in our lives. People often look at their clothing as a reflection of who they are and how they want others to perceive them. However, finding stylish clothes that fit well can be a challenging task. To make matters worse, many stores have limited sizes, styles, and colors, leaving shoppers feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. Fortunately, advances in technology have paved the way for a more efficient solution: virtual try-on technology. With just a few clicks on your phone or computer, you can now see yourself wearing different outfits without ever having to leave home. This allows for easy comparison shopping, which means better value per dollar spent; it also makes use of artificial intelligence to suggest items based on user preferences. Ultimately, these developments represent significant improvements over traditional methods, providing customers with greater utility through improved fitting and personalization while reducing the negative environmental impact caused by shipping returns from online purchases. These systems promise benefits both to consumers and retailers alike.",1
"Knowledge graphs are a versatile framework to encode richly structured data relationships, but it can be challenging to combine these graphs with unstructured data. Methods for retrofitting pre-trained entity representations to the structure of a knowledge graph typically assume that entities are embedded in a connected space and that relations imply similarity. However, useful knowledge graphs often contain diverse entities and relations (with potentially disjoint underlying corpora) which do not accord with these assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we present Functional Retrofitting, a framework that generalizes current retrofitting methods by explicitly modeling pairwise relations. Our framework can directly incorporate a variety of pairwise penalty functions previously developed for knowledge graph completion. Further, it allows users to encode, learn, and extract information about relation semantics. We present both linear and neural instantiations of the framework. Functional Retrofitting significantly outperforms existing retrofitting methods on complex knowledge graphs and loses no accuracy on simpler graphs (in which relations do imply similarity). Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the framework by predicting new drug--disease treatment pairs in a large, complex health knowledge graph.",0

We propose an estimator for high dimensional data enriched model and provide conditions under which it consistently estimates both shared and individual parameters. We also delineate sample complexity of the estimator and present high probability non-asymptotic bound on estimation error of all parameters. Interestingly the sample complexity of our estimator translates to conditions on both per-group sample sizes and the total number of samples. We propose an iterative estimation algorithm with linear convergence rate and supplement our theoretical analysis with synthetic and real experimental results.

Our contributions enhance transparency in decision making processes by providing insights into the reasoning behind each feature incorporation step in addition to ensuring the scalability and interpretability of learned models.

"Network biology has been successfully used to help reveal complex mechanisms of disease, especially cancer. On the other hand, network biology requires in-depth knowledge to construct disease-specific networks, but our current knowledge is very limited even with the recent advances in human cancer biology. Deep learning has shown a great potential to address the difficult situation like this. However, deep learning technologies conventionally use grid-like structured data, thus application of deep learning technologies to the classification of human disease subtypes is yet to be explored. Recently, graph based deep learning techniques have emerged, which becomes an opportunity to leverage analyses in network biology. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model, which integrates two key components 1) graph convolution neural network (graph CNN) and 2) relation network (RN). We utilize graph CNN as a component to learn expression patterns of cooperative gene community, and RN as a component to learn associations between learned patterns. The proposed model is applied to the PAM50 breast cancer subtype classification task, the standard breast cancer subtype classification of clinical utility. In experiments of both subtype classification and patient survival analysis, our proposed method achieved significantly better performances than existing methods.

"The task of representing entire graphs has seen a surge of prominent results, mainly due to learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on graph-structured data.

Here, we coherently propose an approach for embedding entire graphs and show that our feature representations with SVM classifier increase classification accuracy of CNN algorithms and traditional graph kernels. For this we describe a recently discovered graph object, anonymous walk, on which we design task-independent algorithms for learning graph representations in explicit and distributed way.

"This paper presents a novel approach to generating embeddings that can represent the unique characteristics of anonymous walks on graphs. These walks, which traverse nodes without distinguishing among them by their labels, have proven to be useful for capturing important network properties while preserving privacy.

To address these challenges, we propose an algorithmic framework that leverages graph neural networks and randomization techniques to generate compact representations of anonymous walks. We demonstrate how our method effectively captures salient features of complex networks, including hierarchical structure and clustering patterns, while maintaining robustness against noise and variations in walk length. In addition, our method enables efficient query processing and allows for easy incorporation into existing deep learning models for node classification tasks.  Our experiments on synthetic as well as real datasets showcase the effectiveness of our proposed embedding technique compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results indicate that our embeddings capture valuable structural information relevant for predictive modeling and visual analytics applications in domains like social media analysis, traffic flow prediction, and epidemiological simulations.

"Deep learning on graph structures has shown exciting results in various applications. However, few attentions have been paid to the robustness of such models, in contrast to numerous research work for image or text adversarial attack and defense. In this paper, we focus on the adversarial attacks that fool the model by modifying the combinatorial structure of data. We first propose a reinforcement learning based attack method that learns the generalizable attack policy, while only requiring prediction labels from the target classifier. Also, variants of genetic algorithms and gradient methods are presented in the scenario where prediction confidence or gradients are available.

We demonstrate how this approach can effectively capture complex relationships among variables, leading to improved predictive accuracy compared to alternative methods. Our results suggest that learning tree distributions using HMM has potential applications in fields such as natural language processing, bioinformatics, and social network analysis.",1

"This paper investigates the computational complexity of sparse label propagation which has been proposed recently for processing network structured data. Sparse label propagation amounts to a convex optimization problem and might be considered as an extension of basis pursuit from sparse vectors to network structured datasets. Using a standard first-order oracle model, we characterize the number of iterations for sparse label propagation to achieve a prescribed accuracy. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the number of iterations required to achieve a certain accuracy and show that this upper bound is sharp for datasets having a chain structure (e.g., time series).",0

In this paper, we propose a novel superpixel-guided two-view geometric model fitting method (called SDF), which can obtain reliable and consistent results for real images. Specifically, SDF includes three main parts: a deterministic sampling algorithm, a model hypothesis updating strategy and a novel model selection algorithm. The proposed deterministic sampling algorithm generates a set of initial model hypotheses according to the prior information of superpixels. Then the proposed updating strategy further improves the quality of model hypotheses. After that, by analyzing the properties of the updated model hypotheses, the proposed model selection algorithm extends the conventional ""fit-and-remove"" framework to estimate model instances in multiple-structure data. The three parts are tightly coupled to boost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy, and SDF has the deterministic nature. Experimental results show that the proposed SDF has significant advantages over several state-of-the-art fitting methods when it is applied to real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data.",0
"In computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation, it is important to have accurate geometric models of objects present in images. Traditional approaches to model fitting rely on manually designed features and can struggle with ambiguous correspondences and occlusions. Recent advances have used deep learning techniques to learn feature representations that encode shape prior knowledge for more robust model fits. However, these methods often require large amounts of annotated training data and may still suffer from overfitting due to limited spatial resolution of learned features. To address these limitations, we propose using superpixels as a mid-level representation to guide deterministic two-view model fitting. Our approach leverages the high spatial precision of superpixels while allowing for explicit model parameterization and regularization through the use of traditional geometric constraints. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of model fitting compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques across several challenging benchmark datasets. Additionally, our method provides interpretable results by directly estimating dense depth maps from superpixel-aligned point clouds without requiring ground truth annotations during training. This work represents an important step towards accurate and efficient geometric model estimation for computer vision applications.",1

"In recent years, graph convolutional networks have emerged as powerful tools for disease prediction by analyzing complex relationships within data sets. However, traditional methods suffer from limitations such as slow convergence rates and difficulty handling high-dimensional data. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-layered parallel graph convolutional network (ML-PGCN), which utilizes multiple layers of parallel processing to achieve faster training times and improved performance on large datasets. Our approach leverages the advantages of both parallel computing and graph neural networks, enabling us to efficiently capture complex patterns in large, high-dimensional data sets. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that ML-PGCN outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the field of disease prediction using graph convolutional networks, paving the way for more accurate and efficient algorithms in this important area of research.",1
"Graph-structured data such as social networks, functional brain networks, gene regulatory networks, communications networks have brought the interest in generalizing deep learning techniques to graph domains. In this paper, we are interested to design neural networks for graphs with variable length in order to solve learning problems such as vertex classification, graph classification, graph regression, and graph generative tasks. Most existing works have focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures. Numerical results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and 1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs. Graph ConvNets are also 36% more accurate than variational (non-learning) techniques. Finally, the most effective graph ConvNet architecture uses gated edges and residuality. Residuality plays an essential role to learn multi-layer architectures as they provide a 10% gain of performance.",0
"This article presents the idea behind the creation of residual gated graph convolutional networks (ResGCN). The motivation behind creating these neural models was that traditional GCNs have difficulty modelling nonlinear relationships between nodes within graphs due to their reliance on linear functions such as normalised graph Laplacians which assume smoothness of data at all scales. We introduce new layers called residual graph convolutions which use residual connections inspired by residual networks to propagate signals through multiple layers, allowing them to capture more complex dependencies. These layers can then be stacked together to create deep models capable of learning rich representations. Our proposed method shows promising results on several benchmark datasets compared to baseline methods. We discuss potential future directions and open research questions related to incorporating these new insights into existing frameworks and exploring further applications in the wider field of network science.",1
"We propose a new class of metrics on sets, vectors, and functions that can be used in various stages of data mining, including exploratory data analysis, learning, and result interpretation. These new distance functions unify and generalize some of the popular metrics, such as the Jaccard and bag distances on sets, Manhattan distance on vector spaces, and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance on integrable functions. We prove that the new metrics are complete and show useful relationships with $f$-divergences for probability distributions. To further extend our approach to structured objects such as concept hierarchies and ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution. We conduct empirical investigation to demonstrate intuitive interpretation of the new metrics and their effectiveness on real-valued, high-dimensional, and structured data. Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the new metrics outperformed multiple similarity and dissimilarity functions traditionally used in data mining, including the Minkowski family, the fractional $L^p$ family, two $f$-divergences, cosine distance, and two correlation coefficients. Finally, we argue that the new class of metrics is particularly appropriate for rapid processing of high-dimensional and structured data in distance-based learning.",0
"This paper introduces a novel framework for designing machine learning algorithms that operate on complex real-valued inputs, such as images and text documents.

By applying these methods within deep neural networks, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results across multiple domains while maintaining transparency into model behavior. In addition, we provide theoretical justification for our approach, including consistency guarantees under mild assumptions, allowing researchers to confidently deploy our models in practice. Overall, our work provides a powerful toolkit for creating interpretable machine learning systems operating on rich, high-dimensional data types.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have massively impacted visual recognition in 2D images, and are now ubiquitous in state-of-the-art approaches. CNNs do not easily extend, however, to data that are not represented by regular grids, such as 3D shape meshes or other graph-structured data, to which traditional local convolution operators do not directly apply. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-convolution operator to establish correspondences between filter weights and graph neighborhoods with arbitrary connectivity. The key novelty of our approach is that these correspondences are dynamically computed from features learned by the network, rather than relying on predefined static coordinates over the graph as in previous work. We obtain excellent experimental results that significantly improve over previous state-of-the-art shape correspondence results. This shows that our approach can learn effective shape representations from raw input coordinates, without relying on shape descriptors.",0

Furthermore, we show that by steering the attention towards informative features, our model significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of FeaStGCN as a general framework applicable for many downstream applications involving 3D shape processing.",1
Protein-ligand scoring is an important step in a structure-based drug design pipeline. Selecting a correct binding pose and predicting the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex enables effective virtual screening. Machine learning techniques can make use of the increasing amounts of structural data that are becoming publicly available. Convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions in particular have shown promise in pose selection and affinity prediction for protein-ligand complexes. Neural networks are known for being difficult to interpret. Understanding the decisions of a particular network can help tune parameters and training data to maximize performance. Visualization of neural networks helps decompose complex scoring functions into pictures that are more easily parsed by humans. Here we present three methods for visualizing how individual protein-ligand complexes are interpreted by 3D convolutional neural networks. We also present a visualization of the convolutional filters and their weights. We describe how the intuition provided by these visualizations aids in network design.,0
"Deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been increasingly used to predict protein–ligand binding affinity, which plays a critical role in drug discovery. In this work, we visualize CNN scoring functions trained on large datasets of protein–ligand complexes to better understand their performance and limitations. We compare two widely used scoring functions – KiloScale, a simple sum-of-atom features method that computes geometric shapes between ligands and proteins using predefined radial grids; and PyRx2, a deep learning algorithm that employs convolutional neural networks to directly model atomic interactions without relying on any hand-engineered descriptors. Our results show that both methods perform well across different data splits but with certain weaknesses: KiloScale struggles more than PyRx2 when benchmarked against experimental results from high throughput screening assays. Additionally, we observe that overfitting and underfitting are common issues associated with both models. To mitigate these problems, regularization techniques like dropout can significantly improve accuracy while reducing variance in predictions. Lastly, our visualizations provide insights into how CNNs capture complex interactions between ligands and target sites on proteins by highlighting specific amino acid residues crucial for the binding process. This study underscores the importance of evaluating the accuracy of machine learning methods used in drug discovery and rational design and offers strategies for improving current approaches. Further research is warranted to address remaining challenges related to generalizability and transferability of deep learning models across diverse protein structures and ligand chemotypes.

"Superior performance and ease of implementation have fostered the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for a wide array of inference and reconstruction tasks. CNNs implement three basic blocks: convolution, pooling and pointwise nonlinearity. Since the two first operations are well-defined only on regular-structured data such as audio or images, application of CNNs to contemporary datasets where the information is defined in irregular domains is challenging. This paper investigates CNNs architectures to operate on signals whose support can be modeled using a graph. Architectures that replace the regular convolution with a so-called linear shift-invariant graph filter have been recently proposed. This paper goes one step further and, under the framework of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) graph filters, imposes additional structure on the adopted graph filters, to obtain three new (more parsimonious) architectures. The proposed architectures result in a lower number of model parameters, reducing the computational complexity, facilitating the training, and mitigating the risk of overfitting. Simulations show that the proposed simpler architectures achieve similar performance as more complex models.",0
"Improving the accuracy and efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been an active research area in recent years. One approach that has shown promise is the use of graph filters, which can capture complex relationships among neighboring pixels in images.

This paper presents a comprehensive study of MIMO graph filters for CNNs, exploring their benefits and limitations across different network architectures and datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that MIMO graph filters consistently improve CNN performance compared to traditional spatial domain filters, while offering computational advantages due to their efficient implementation using tensor operations. Furthermore, we introduce new techniques for optimizing MIMO filter design based on task-specific constraints, yielding even better performance gains without sacrificing model interpretability.

"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful deep neural networks for graph-structured data. However, GCN computes the representation of a node recursively from its neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the number of layers. Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by subsampling neighbors do not have a convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop control variate based algorithms which allow sampling an arbitrarily small neighbor size. Furthermore, we prove new theoretical guarantee for our algorithms to converge to a local optimum of GCN. Empirical results show that our algorithms enjoy a similar convergence with the exact algorithm using only two neighbors per node. The runtime of our algorithms on a large Reddit dataset is only one seventh of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.",0
"In recent years, graph convolutional networks (GCN) have shown great promise in many applications such as node classification, link prediction and semi-supervised learning on graphs.

By reducing the variance during backpropagation, our approach improves convergence speed and accuracy of the model while significantly reducing computational costs compared to batch methods. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across several benchmark datasets in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. This work provides new insights into the training process of GCNs, offering opportunities for future research in the field.",1
"Graph-based methods are known to be successful in many machine learning and pattern classification tasks. These methods consider semi-structured data as graphs where nodes correspond to primitives (parts, interest points, segments, etc.) and edges characterize the relationships between these primitives. However, these non-vectorial graph data cannot be straightforwardly plugged into off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms without a preliminary step of -- explicit/implicit -- graph vectorization and embedding. This embedding process should be resilient to intra-class graph variations while being highly discriminant. In this paper, we propose a novel high-order stochastic graphlet embedding (SGE) that maps graphs into vector spaces. Our main contribution includes a new stochastic search procedure that efficiently parses a given graph and extracts/samples unlimitedly high-order graphlets. We consider these graphlets, with increasing orders, to model local primitives as well as their increasingly complex interactions. In order to build our graph representation, we measure the distribution of these graphlets into a given graph, using particular hash functions that efficiently assign sampled graphlets into isomorphic sets with a very low probability of collision. When combined with maximum margin classifiers, these graphlet-based representations have positive impact on the performance of pattern comparison and recognition as corroborated through extensive experiments using standard benchmark databases.",0
"GraphKernelsBasedOnHighOrderGraphLetParsingAndHashing_Abstract:  This paper presents a novel approach to graph kernels that utilizes high order graphlet parsing and hashing techniques. We propose two methods for generating graphlets from input graphs - parallel graphlet decomposition (PGD) and iterative neighborhood expansion (INE). PGD groups non-isomorphic connected subgraphs into classes while INE generates a hierarchy of nested subgraphs. By applying hashing functions to these graphlets, we create a compact representation which can then be used as inputs for kernel machines. Our method allows us to capture higher-order relationships between nodes and compare large graphs efficiently without resorting to expensive all-pairs computations. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to existing state-of-the art graph kernel methods.",1

"This paper presents a novel method for matching convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without relying on priors about the data.

"Deep generative models have been enjoying success in modeling continuous data. However it remains challenging to capture the representations for discrete structures with formal grammars and semantics, e.g., computer programs and molecular structures. How to generate both syntactically and semantically correct data still remains largely an open problem. Inspired by the theory of compiler where the syntax and semantics check is done via syntax-directed translation (SDT), we propose a novel syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) by introducing stochastic lazy attributes. This approach converts the offline SDT check into on-the-fly generated guidance for constraining the decoder. Comparing to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach enforces constraints on the output space so that the output will be not only syntactically valid, but also semantically reasonable. We evaluate the proposed model with applications in programming language and molecules, including reconstruction and program/molecule optimization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints in discrete generative models, which is significantly better than current state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach for generating structured data using a syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SDVAE). Structured data refers to data that has a defined structure or schema, such as JSON or XML documents. Existing methods for generating structured data typically rely on hand-coded rules or templates, which can lead to limited expressiveness and difficulty handling complex structures. In contrast, SDVAEs use deep learning techniques to learn representations of structured data and generate new instances by probabilistically sampling from these learned distributions. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying syntax into the VAE architecture, we show that our model can achieve better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods for generating structured data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and illustrate how our models can be used for downstream tasks such as text completion and question answering. Our work represents a significant step towards enabling more general and flexible ways of synthesizing structured content.",1
"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based machine learning systems have made breakthroughs in feature extraction and image recognition tasks in two dimensions (2D). Although there is significant ongoing work to apply CNN technology to domains involving complex 3D data, the success of such efforts has been constrained, in part, by limitations in data representation techniques. Most current approaches rely upon low-resolution 3D models, strategic limitation of scope in the 3D space, or the application of lossy projection techniques to allow for the use of 2D CNNs. To address this issue, we present a mapping algorithm that converts 3D structures to 2D and 1D data grids by mapping a traversal of a 3D space-filling curve to the traversal of corresponding 2D and 1D curves. We explore the performance of 2D and 1D CNNs trained on data encoded with our method versus comparable volumetric CNNs operating upon raw 3D data from a popular benchmarking dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that both 2D and 1D representations of 3D data generated via our method preserve a significant proportion of the 3D data's features in forms learnable by CNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method of encoding 3D data into lower-dimensional representations allows for decreased CNN training time cost, increased original 3D model rendering resolutions, and supports increased numbers of data channels when compared to purely volumetric approaches. This demonstration is accomplished in the context of a structural biology classification task wherein we train 3D, 2D, and 1D CNNs on examples of two homologous branches within the Ras protein family.

"'Big' high-dimensional data are commonly analyzed in low-dimensions, after performing a dimensionality-reduction step that inherently distorts the data structure. For the same purpose, clustering methods are also often used. These methods also introduce a bias, either by starting from the assumption of a particular geometric form of the clusters, or by using iterative schemes to enhance cluster contours, with uncontrollable consequences. The goal of data analysis should, however, be to encode and detect structural data features at all scales and densities simultaneously, without assuming a parametric form of data point distances, or modifying them. We propose a novel approach that directly encodes data point neighborhood similarities as a sparse graph. Our non-iterative framework permits a transparent interpretation of data, without altering the original data dimension and metric.

"In recent years, graph theory has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding complex systems across diverse fields such as computer science, physics, biology, sociology, economics, and more. One of the key aspects of graph theory lies in representing real-world phenomena using mathematical structures known as graphs, which consist of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges that represent relationships between them. Neighborhood similarity graphs (NSGs), which capture local similarities between objects within networks, have gained significant attention due to their ability to reveal intricate patterns within these graphs that traditional approaches might miss.

To address this issue, we propose topology adaptive graph convolutional networks (TAGConv), a new framework that enables GCNs to learn from data that varies across different parts of a graph while preserving their original expressiveness. Our method introduces local neighborhood sampling and adaptive mixing, two novel techniques designed to capture finer details of local structures while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate TAGConv's effectiveness in significantly improving over state-of-the-art methods, making our approach well-suited for tackling diverse and challenging tasks involving complex graphs.

We cast the task of geometric model fitting as a representative mode-seeking problem on hypergraphs. Specifically, a hypergraph is firstly constructed, where the vertices represent model hypotheses and the hyperedges denote data points. The hypergraph involves higher-order similarities (instead of pairwise similarities used on a simple graph), and it can characterize complex relationships between model hypotheses and data points. {In addition, we develop a hypergraph reduction technique to remove ""insignificant"" vertices while retaining as many ""significant"" vertices as possible in the hypergraph}. Based on the {simplified hypergraph, we then propose a novel mode-seeking algorithm to search for representative modes within reasonable time.

"Learning representations on Grassmann manifolds is popular in quite a few visual recognition tasks. In order to enable deep learning on Grassmann manifolds, this paper proposes a deep network architecture by generalizing the Euclidean network paradigm to Grassmann manifolds. In particular, we design full rank mapping layers to transform input Grassmannian data to more desirable ones, exploit re-orthonormalization layers to normalize the resulting matrices, study projection pooling layers to reduce the model complexity in the Grassmannian context, and devise projection mapping layers to respect Grassmannian geometry and meanwhile achieve Euclidean forms for regular output layers. To train the Grassmann networks, we exploit a stochastic gradient descent setting on manifolds of the connection weights, and study a matrix generalization of backpropagation to update the structured data. The evaluations on three visual recognition tasks show that our Grassmann networks have clear advantages over existing Grassmann learning methods, and achieve results comparable with state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"Artificial neural networks provide powerful models that achieve state-of-the-art performance across many applications such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, among others. These advances have motivated researchers to consider different architectures beyond traditional Euclidean deep learning frameworks in order to model complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. One promising approach relies on representing data living on manifolds using intrinsically defined deep network architectures built upon these structures. Grassmannian spaces constitute special cases of Stiefel manifolds which parameterize subspaces of any dimension in Euclidean space. They play a pivotal role in fields like computer vision and signal processing since linear transformations capture essential features relevant in these areas. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing machine learning algorithms tailored specifically for processing Grassmannian data. However, designing efficient and expressive methods remains challenging due to the limited smoothness properties exhibited by these geometric spaces. We aim to address this issue and develop a new framework based on autoencoders to learn meaningful representations directly from high-dimensional Grassmannians while exploiting the underlying geometry. Our contribution highlights how proper regularization techniques can enable the training process resulting in accurate approximations with improved stability. Furthermore, we showcase several experiments demonstrating the efficacy of our approach by comparing against existing baselines over two important tasks: camera pose estimation in visual scenes, and dimensionality reduction applied to motion segmentation problems arising from video sequences. Our findings corroborate the utility of equivariant autoencoders constructed on top of nonflat Riemannian geometries providing insights into handling nonEuclidean datadistributions when deploying convolutional neural networks on Lie groups.

"Molecular activity prediction is critical in drug design. Machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and random forests have been successful for this task. These models require fixed-size feature vectors as input while the molecules are variable in size and structure. As a result, fixed-size fingerprint representation is poor in handling substructures for large molecules. In addition, molecular activity tests, or a so-called BioAssays, are relatively small in the number of tested molecules due to its complexity. Here we approach the problem through deep neural networks as they are flexible in modeling structured data such as grids, sequences and graphs. We train multiple BioAssays using a multi-task learning framework, which combines information from multiple sources to improve the performance of prediction, especially on small datasets. We propose Graph Memory Network (GraphMem), a memory-augmented neural network to model the graph structure in molecules. GraphMem consists of a recurrent controller coupled with an external memory whose cells dynamically interact and change through a multi-hop reasoning process. Applied to the molecules, the dynamic interactions enable an iterative refinement of the representation of molecular graphs with multiple bond types.

"Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry as it is ideally suited to learn representations for structured data and speed up the exploration of chemical space. While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. This includes rotationally invariant energy predictions and a smooth, differentiable potential energy surface. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical and structural variations that suggests the path for further work.",0

"This is an attempt at writing a paper abstract for ""Hidden Tree Markov Networks: Deep and Wide Learning for Structured Data"". Here we go... Abstract: We present a novel approach to structured data learning using deep neural networks (DNNs). Our method combines the traditional tree structure of Markov models with deep learning techniques. By doing so, we can achieve better performance than existing methods while retaining interpretability. In our model, each node represents a feature in the dataset. Edges represent probabilistic dependencies between features, which are learned through training on labeled examples. Unlike traditional DNNs, which have only one hidden layer, our method allows multiple layers per stage and the ability to stack stages together to form a complex network. We demonstrate our method by applying it to several real datasets from diverse domains such as image generation, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis. On these tasks, our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively, validating the effectiveness and generality of our method. In conclusion, Hidden Tree Markov Networks (HTMNs) provide a powerful tool for modeling structured data that strikes a balance between expressive power and interpretability.

"A fundamental challenge in developing high-impact machine learning technologies is balancing the need to model rich, structured domains with the ability to scale to big data. Many important problem areas are both richly structured and large scale, from social and biological networks, to knowledge graphs and the Web, to images, video, and natural language. In this paper, we introduce two new formalisms for modeling structured data, and show that they can both capture rich structure and scale to big data. The first, hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic graphical model that generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite three approaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and fuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference objective. We then define HL-MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The second new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic programming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on first-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable variable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the parameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous discrete models, but much more scalable. Together, these algorithms enable HL-MRFs and PSL to model rich, structured data at scales not previously possible.",0
"Title: Advancements in Artificial Intelligence through Combination of Markov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic  Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress over the past few decades due to advances in deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. One area that remains challenging for AI systems is reasoning and decision making under uncertainty, which is essential for many real-world applications such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this challenge by combining two powerful mathematical frameworks - Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL). MRFs provide a graphical representation of probabilistic relationships among variables, allowing efficient inference and optimization. PSL provides a flexible framework for modeling complex dependencies and decision rules using logic programming and probability theory.  We introduce hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRF), a new variant of MRFs based on logit functions with a smooth approximation of the hinge loss function. This allows us to model more general types of dependencies, including non-monotonicities and disjunctions, while still maintaining efficiency in inference. We then integrate HL-MRFs into our existing PSL models and demonstrate their effectiveness in several experimental settings.  Our results show that the combination of HL-MRFs and PSL significantly improves performance across different domains compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach opens up new possibilities for building AI systems that can reason and make decisions under uncertainty in a principled manner.

"Graphs have become increasingly important as data structures for representing complex relationships and dependencies among objects within data sets. Unlike traditional relational databases that rely on tables filled with structured and homogeneous data elements such as numbers and strings, graphs organize their entities as nodes and edges that can connect multiple elements at different scales and levels of granularity. By definition, graphs provide an ideal modeling framework for understanding social networks, transportation systems, biological molecules, brain connectivity patterns, financial transactions, weather and climate interactions, cybersecurity threat scenarios, scientific knowledge repositories, and numerous other real-world applications. Because many graph problems involve multiple layers of structure and heterogeneities that affect edge weights and nodal attributes, developing scalable machine learning algorithms that capture high order proximity measures has been challenging. The main contribution of our work is twofold: we first propose a novel, adaptive algorithmic architecture designed specifically to scale up existing state-of-the-art convolutional models for large scale graphs by redefining how messages are passed across network neighborhoods; then, we demonstrate through extensive experiments over several benchmark datasets that the resulting accuracy improvement outperforms all other alternatives. Our approach leads us towards bridging the gap between theory and practice towards making deep learning methods more applicable for complex graph analysis tasks.

"We propose a family of near-metrics based on local graph diffusion to capture similarity for a wide class of data sets. These quasi-metametrics, as their names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces, specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively. The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features. By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.",0
"Introducing a new family of near-metrics that can accurately capture similarity across a variety of domains, our proposed method represents a significant advancement over traditional distance metrics like Euclidean distance.

In addition, our approach is computationally efficient, allowing for fast similarity computations on large datasets.

"We propose Embedding Propagation (EP), an unsupervised learning framework for graph-structured data. EP learns vector representations of graphs by passing two types of messages between neighboring nodes. Forward messages consist of label representations such as representations of words and other attributes associated with the nodes. Backward messages consist of gradients that result from aggregating the label representations and applying a reconstruction loss. Node representations are finally computed from the representation of their labels. With significantly fewer parameters and hyperparameters an instance of EP is competitive with and often outperforms state of the art unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods on a range of benchmark data sets.",0

"Sales forecast is an essential task in E-commerce and has a crucial impact on making informed business decisions. It can help us to manage the workforce, cash flow and resources such as optimizing the supply chain of manufacturers etc. Sales forecast is a challenging problem in that sales is affected by many factors including promotion activities, price changes, and user preferences etc. Traditional sales forecast techniques mainly rely on historical sales data to predict future sales and their accuracies are limited. Some more recent learning-based methods capture more information in the model to improve the forecast accuracy. However, these methods require case-by-case manual feature engineering for specific commercial scenarios, which is usually a difficult, time-consuming task and requires expert knowledge. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a novel approach in this paper to learn effective features automatically from the structured data using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). When fed with raw log data, our approach can automatically extract effective features from that and then forecast sales using those extracted features.

"We are in the era of data analytics and data science which is on full bloom. There is abundance of all kinds of data for example biometrics based data, satellite images data, chip-seq data, social network data, sensor based data etc. from a variety of sources. This data abundance is the result of the fact that storage cost is getting cheaper day by day, so people as well as almost all business or scientific organizations are storing more and more data. Most of the real data is multi-dimensional, non-uniform, and big in size, such that it requires a unique pre-processing before analyzing it. In order to make data useful for any kind of analysis, pre-processing is a very important step. This paper presents a unique and novel pre-processing method for multi-dimensional and non-uniform data with the aim of making it uniform and reduced in size without losing much of its value. We have chosen biometric signature data to demonstrate the proposed method as it qualifies for the attributes of being multi-dimensional, non-uniform and big in size. Biometric signature data does not only captures the structural characteristics of a signature but also its behavioral characteristics that are captured using a dynamic signature capture device. These features like pen pressure, pen tilt angle, time taken to sign a document when collected in real-time turn out to be of varying dimensions. This feature data set along with the structural data needs to be pre-processed in order to use it to train a machine learning based model for signature verification purposes. We demonstrate the success of the proposed method over other methods using experimental results for biometric signature data but the same can be implemented for any other data with similar properties from a different domain.",0

"With the recent rise in the amount of structured data available, there has been considerable interest in methods for machine learning with graphs. Many of these approaches have been kernel methods, which focus on measuring the similarity between graphs. These generally involving measuring the similarity of structural elements such as walks or paths. Borgwardt and Kriegel proposed the all-paths kernel but emphasized that it is NP-hard to compute and infeasible in practice, favouring instead the shortest-path kernel. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for computing the all-paths kernel which is very efficient and enrich it further by including the simple cycles as well. We demonstrate how it is feasible even on large datasets to compute all the paths and simple cycles up to a moderate length. We show how to count labelled paths/simple cycles between vertices of a graph and evaluate a labelled path and simple cycles kernel. Extensive evaluations on a variety of graph datasets demonstrate that the all-paths and cycles kernel has superior performance to the shortest-path kernel and state-of-the-art performance overall.",0
"In recent years, graph kernels have been widely used in machine learning tasks such as node classification and link prediction on graphs. One important challenge in designing graph kernels is how to properly compare subgraph distributions that may differ substantially due to edge deletions, insertions, or modifications.

The proposed kernel computes similarities by comparing paths and cycles using random walks, encoding global graph properties through repeated loops and small local structures along random walks. By leveraging the similarity between random walks and Brownian motion on infinite regular trees, we can estimate the distribution of all shortest path lengths and longest cycles in finite graphs accurately without resorting to exhaustive search.

"Class imbalance is a challenging issue in practical classification problems for deep learning models as well as traditional models. Traditionally successful countermeasures such as synthetic over-sampling have had limited success with complex, structured data handled by deep learning models. In this paper, we propose Deep Over-sampling (DOS), a framework for extending the synthetic over-sampling method to exploit the deep feature space acquired by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Its key feature is an explicit, supervised representation learning, for which the training data presents each raw input sample with a synthetic embedding target in the deep feature space, which is sampled from the linear subspace of in-class neighbors. We implement an iterative process of training the CNN and updating the targets, which induces smaller in-class variance among the embeddings, to increase the discriminative power of the deep representation. We present an empirical study using public benchmarks, which shows that the DOS framework not only counteracts class imbalance better than the existing method, but also improves the performance of the CNN in the standard, balanced settings.",0

Consequently, TGP generalises classical Bayesian matrix factorisation models, and goes beyond them to give a natural and elegant method for incorporating side information, giving enhanced predictive performance for CF problems. Moreover we show that it is a novel model for regression, especially well-suited to grid-structured data and problems where the dependence on covariates is close to being separable.",0

"We propose a novel method to fit and segment multi-structural data via convex relaxation. Unlike greedy methods --which maximise the number of inliers-- this approach efficiently searches for a soft assignment of points to models by minimising the energy of the overall classification. Our approach is similar to state-of-the-art energy minimisation techniques which use a global energy. However, we deal with the scaling factor (as the number of models increases) of the original combinatorial problem by relaxing the solution. This relaxation brings two advantages: first, by operating in the continuous domain we can parallelize the calculations. Second, it allows for the use of different metrics which results in a more general formulation.   We demonstrate the versatility of our technique on two different problems of estimating structure from images: plane extraction from RGB-D data and homography estimation from pairs of images. In both cases, we report accurate results on publicly available datasets, in most of the cases outperforming the state-of-the-art.",0

"Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph based tasks, embeddings have been learned in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. However, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but negatively curved, hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space.

"Graph embedding provides an efficient solution for graph analysis by converting the graph into a low-dimensional space which preserves the structure information. In contrast to the graph structure data, the i.i.d. node embedding can be processed efficiently in terms of both time and space. Current semi-supervised graph embedding algorithms assume the labelled nodes are given, which may not be always true in the real world. While manually label all training data is inapplicable, how to select the subset of training data to label so as to maximize the graph analysis task performance is of great importance. This motivates our proposed active graph embedding (AGE) framework, in which we design a general active learning query strategy for any semi-supervised graph embedding algorithm. AGE selects the most informative nodes as the training labelled nodes based on the graphical information (i.e., node centrality) as well as the learnt node embedding (i.e., node classification uncertainty and node embedding representativeness). Different query criteria are combined with the time-sensitive parameters which shift the focus from graph based query criteria to embedding based criteria as the learning progresses. Experiments have been conducted on three public data sets and the results verified the effectiveness of each component of our query strategy and the power of combining them using time-sensitive parameters.

"Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing data that can be represented by graphs, such as neuroimaging data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allows researchers to study human brain function at high spatial resolution. In recent years, deep neural networks have shown great promise in processing complex data sets, including those represented as graph signals. This paper presents a new framework that leverages the advantages of both GSP and deep learning techniques to perform brain imaging analysis. We propose using deep neural networks directly on graph signals, without the need for any additional preprocessing steps. Our method can effectively capture the structural information present in fMRI data while maintaining the power of deep learning architectures. Experiments conducted on simulated and real fMRI data demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over traditional methods and other state-of-the-art techniques.

"This paper introduces a generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from low-dimensional grid data, such as images, to graph-structured data. We propose a novel spatial convolution utilizing a random walk to uncover the relations within the input, analogous to the way the standard convolution uses the spatial neighborhood of a pixel on the grid. The convolution has an intuitive interpretation, is efficient and scalable and can also be used on data with varying graph structure. Furthermore, this generalization can be applied to many standard regression or classification problems, by learning the the underlying graph. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed CNN on MNIST, and challenge the state-of-the-art on Merck molecular activity data set.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has emerged as one of the most powerful tools in artificial intelligence due to its ability to tackle complex problems across various domains. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been particularly successful, especially when dealing with data represented by grid structures such as images and videos. However, many types of data are naturally modeled as graphs rather than grids, such as social interactions, protein interactions, and knowledge graphs. These graph-structured datasets pose unique challenges that current CNN architectures cannot effectively handle.  This paper presents a generalization of CNNs to work with graph-structured data called GCNets (graph convolutional neural nets). Our method extends standard CNN techniques to operate on graph domains via several key innovations:   * We introduce node initialization layers to learn vertex representations from sparse, unnormalized graph inputs directly without requiring input normalization. * Edge conditioning layers model edge relationships for each channel separately enabling better control over propagation patterns. * A subgraph pooling layer provides a flexible mechanism to merge information from multiple channels. By stacking these three layers together, our GCNets can propagate feature messages along edges and update vertex features within a mini-batch gradient descent framework suitable for large datasets.  In addition to our theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GCNets through extensive experiments using both semi-synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. Results indicate that GCNets outperform competitive baselines including state-of-the-art methods tailored specifically for certain tasks. With broad application potential, GCNets establish a new family of models capable of harnessing graph structure with CNN architectures for improved performance in deep learning applied to graph structured data.",1
"Many different classification tasks need to manage structured data, which are usually modeled as graphs. Moreover, these graphs can be dynamic, meaning that the vertices/edges of each graph may change during time. Our goal is to jointly exploit structured data and temporal information through the use of a neural network model. To the best of our knowledge, this task has not been addressed using these kind of architectures. For this reason, we propose two novel approaches, which combine Long Short-Term Memory networks and Graph Convolutional Networks to learn long short-term dependencies together with graph structure. The quality of our methods is confirmed by the promising results achieved.",0
"Abstract: This paper proposes the use of dynamic graph convolutional networks (DGCN) for image classification tasks. DGCN builds on recent advances in graph neural network research, which have focused largely on static graphs that assume stationary relationships among nodes. In contrast, DGCN incorporates temporal dynamics into the process by learning both time-invariant and time-varying features of the data, resulting in more effective representations for image classification problems. We apply our methodology to several benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the art performance on all of them, demonstrating the utility of DGCN for computer vision applications. Overall, we believe that the combination of spatial and temporal processing in DGCN has significant potential for improving results in other domains as well.",1
"This paper describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which, with interactive graphics, can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this paper, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using the ggplot2, plotly, and shiny packages.",0

"This paper presents a novel method for structural data recognition using a large number of graph models. In general, prevalent methods for structural data recognition have two shortcomings: 1) Only a single model is used to capture structural variation. 2) Naive recognition methods are used, such as the nearest neighbor method. In this paper, we propose strengthening the recognition performance of these models as well as their ability to capture structural variation. The proposed method constructs a large number of graph models and trains decision trees using the models. This paper makes two main contributions. The first is a novel graph model that can quickly perform calculations, which allows us to construct several models in a feasible amount of time. The second contribution is a novel approach to structural data recognition: graph model boosting. Comprehensive structural variations can be captured with a large number of graph models constructed in a boosting framework, and a sophisticated classifier can be formed by aggregating the decision trees. Consequently, we can carry out structural data recognition with powerful recognition capability in the face of comprehensive structural variation. The experiments shows that the proposed method achieves impressive results and outperforms existing methods on datasets of IAM graph database repository.",0

We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.,0
"In recent years, semi-supervised learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to improve model accuracy on small labeled datasets. One approach that has gained attention in this area is graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which can effectively capture spatial relationships between nodes in a graph. However, there remains a significant gap between state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods using GCNs. This paper presents a novel framework for semi-supervised classification using GCNs that addresses this gap by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in a more effective manner than previous approaches. Our method introduces two key components: a self-training module that utilizes the predictions from the current model as pseudo labels for unlabeled data, and a multi-scale neighborhood sampling strategy that enables better exploration of local and global geometric structures within the network. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to other semi-supervised learning methods based on GCNs.",1
"The success of kernel methods has initiated the design of novel positive semidefinite functions, in particular for structured data. A leading design paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels, in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.",0

Computational approaches to drug discovery can reduce the time and cost associated with experimental assays and enable the screening of novel chemotypes. Structure-based drug design methods rely on scoring functions to rank and predict binding affinities and poses. The ever-expanding amount of protein-ligand binding and structural data enables the use of deep machine learning techniques for protein-ligand scoring.   We describe convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions that take as input a comprehensive 3D representation of a protein-ligand interaction. A CNN scoring function automatically learns the key features of protein-ligand interactions that correlate with binding. We train and optimize our CNN scoring functions to discriminate between correct and incorrect binding poses and known binders and non-binders. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms the AutoDock Vina scoring function when ranking poses both for pose prediction and virtual screening.,0
"This paper presents a novel method for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using convolutional neural networks (CNN). In recent years, deep learning methods have shown great promise in improving prediction accuracy across diverse biochemical tasks. However, despite their successes, most state-of-the-art systems still rely on handcrafted features or preprocess the data into simpler representations before feeding them into CNN models. We take a step towards mitigating these limitations by utilizing raw molecular structures as input directly, without any feature engineering. Our approach leverages the inductive biases provided by traditional machine learning techniques while maintaining a high degree of interpretability due to our end-to-end design. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) and the Platinum DUD. Results show that our method outperforms several established machine learning algorithms in both cases, demonstrating the potential applicability of direct molecule representation in ligand docking problems. With this promising result, further research should focus on extending our system towards more complex predictions such as pose ranking and metabolic profiling. Ultimately, successful integration of advanced computer vision techniques like those presented here may lead to improved drug discovery pipelines and faster development of novel therapeutics.",1

"Current approaches for fine-grained recognition do the following: First, recruit experts to annotate a dataset of images, optionally also collecting more structured data in the form of part annotations and bounding boxes. Second, train a model utilizing this data. Toward the goal of solving fine-grained recognition, we introduce an alternative approach, leveraging free, noisy data from the web and simple, generic methods of recognition. This approach has benefits in both performance and scalability. We demonstrate its efficacy on four fine-grained datasets, greatly exceeding existing state of the art without the manual collection of even a single label, and furthermore show first results at scaling to more than 10,000 fine-grained categories. Quantitatively, we achieve top-1 accuracies of 92.3% on CUB-200-2011, 85.4% on Birdsnap, 93.4% on FGVC-Aircraft, and 80.8% on Stanford Dogs without using their annotated training sets. We compare our approach to an active learning approach for expanding fine-grained datasets.",0
"One of the central challenges facing modern computer vision systems is how to accurately recognize fine-grained distinctions within complex datasets. In recent years, researchers have proposed many approaches to tackling this problem, from utilizing large amounts of labeled data to employing powerful deep learning models. However, one underappreciated factor that has emerged as surprisingly effective at improving recognition performance is the use of noisy data. This paper investigates the unexpected effectiveness of noisy data for fine-grained recognition tasks by analyzing numerous case studies across multiple domains. We find that incorporating even small amounts of noisy data can significantly improve system accuracy, often surpassing other commonly employed techniques such as augmentation or model ensemble methods. Our results provide insight into why noisy data may act as regularization, encourage more robust features, and promote generalizability. These observations contribute important new insights into the design and training of computer vision systems.

"Multivariate time series naturally exist in many fields, like energy, bioinformatics, signal processing, and finance. Most of these applications need to be able to compare these structured data. In this context, dynamic time warping (DTW) is probably the most common comparison measure. However, not much research effort has been put into improving it by learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning similarities based on DTW, in order to improve time series classification. Making use of the uniform stability framework, we provide the first theoretical guarantees in the form of a generalization bound for linear classification. The experimental study shows that the proposed approach is efficient, while yielding sparse classifiers.",0

The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that it can handle non-linearity and/or structured data through kernels. Namely, the proposed algorithm can be used for wider range of applications including nonlinear multi-class classification and multi-variate regressions, while existing PSI algorithms cannot handle them. Through synthetic experiments, we show that the proposed approach can find a set of statistically significant features for both regression and classification problems. Moreover, we apply the hsicInf algorithm to a real-world data, and show that hsicInf can successfully identify important features.",0
"This paper presents new methods for performing inference after model selection using kernel methods. We focus on situations where many candidate models have been fit to data and we would like to select one or a few promising models to investigate further. Our approach builds upon classical post hoc techniques that involve fitting additional parameters to only those parts of the model space that survive selection, which can lead to estimates that suffer from excess variability and poor coverage properties. Instead, we develop new kernels that directly incorporate selected model components into the analysis, allowing us to obtain accurate posterior inference without requiring any additional tuning. Our methods are shown through simulation studies to provide improved frequentist predictive performance and uncertainty quantification compared to standard model averaging procedures, while offering advantages over alternative Bayesian approaches by providing well-calibrated point predictions and uncertainty intervals even under complex or misspecified models.",1
"This paper proposes a two-view deterministic geometric model fitting method, termed Superpixel-based Deterministic Fitting (SDF), for multiple-structure data. SDF starts from superpixel segmentation, which effectively captures prior information of feature appearances. The feature appearances are beneficial to reduce the computational complexity for deterministic fitting methods. SDF also includes two original elements, i.e., a deterministic sampling algorithm and a novel model selection algorithm. The two algorithms are tightly coupled to boost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy. Specifically, the proposed sampling algorithm leverages the grouping cues of superpixels to generate reliable and consistent hypotheses. The proposed model selection algorithm further makes use of desirable properties of the generated hypotheses, to improve the conventional fit-and-remove framework for more efficient and effective performance. The key characteristic of SDF is that it can efficiently and deterministically estimate the parameters of model instances in multi-structure data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SDF shows superiority over several state-of-the-art fitting methods for real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data.",0

"A number of applications in engineering, social sciences, physics, and biology involve inference over networks. In this context, graph signals are widely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features in graph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisy observations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensively analyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paper advocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modeling and reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signal reconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of graph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers fresh insights, and allows for estimators to leverage richer forms of prior information than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such as bandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturally accommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes on the so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existing Thikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilistic interpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivated by the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators or the kernel map in kernel-based methods, the present paper further proposes two multi-kernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enables estimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allows for efficient graph filter selection. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods relative to state-of-the-art alternatives.",0
"In recent years, graph signals have become increasingly important due to their ability to capture complex relationships among data points.

The proposed method formulates geometric model fitting as a mode seeking problem on a hypergraph in which vertices represent model hypotheses and hyperedges denote data points. MSH intuitively detects model instances by a simple and effective mode seeking algorithm. In addition to the mode seeking algorithm, MSH includes a similarity measure between vertices on the hypergraph and a weight-aware sampling technique. The proposed method not only alleviates sensitivity to the data distribution, but also is scalable to large scale problems. Experimental results further demonstrate that the proposed method has significant superiority over the state-of-the-art fitting methods on both synthetic data and real images.",0
"This paper presents a method for mode-seeking on hypergraphs, which can be used for robust geometric model fitting. Traditional methods for geometric model fitting assume that there is only one correct solution, but in reality, there may be multiple possible solutions depending on noise and other factors. In order to handle these situations, our approach uses hypergraphs to represent multiple modes (solutions) simultaneously. We introduce a novel algorithm for searching the space of all possible hyperedges (combinations of vertices), which allows us to find meaningful patterns among the data points. Our experiments show that our method outperforms traditional methods by finding more accurate models even under challenging conditions.

"By taking the semantic object parsing task as an exemplar application scenario, we propose the Graph Long Short-Term Memory (Graph LSTM) network, which is the generalization of LSTM from sequential data or multi-dimensional data to general graph-structured data. Particularly, instead of evenly and fixedly dividing an image to pixels or patches in existing multi-dimensional LSTM structures (e.g., Row, Grid and Diagonal LSTMs), we take each arbitrary-shaped superpixel as a semantically consistent node, and adaptively construct an undirected graph for each image, where the spatial relations of the superpixels are naturally used as edges. Constructed on such an adaptive graph topology, the Graph LSTM is more naturally aligned with the visual patterns in the image (e.g., object boundaries or appearance similarities) and provides a more economical information propagation route. Furthermore, for each optimization step over Graph LSTM, we propose to use a confidence-driven scheme to update the hidden and memory states of nodes progressively till all nodes are updated. In addition, for each node, the forgets gates are adaptively learned to capture different degrees of semantic correlation with neighboring nodes. Comprehensive evaluations on four diverse semantic object parsing datasets well demonstrate the significant superiority of our Graph LSTM over other state-of-the-art solutions.",0
"This work presents an approach to semantic object parsing using graph Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We propose a method that takes as input a scene image and a sentence describing it, and generates an output representing the objects and their relationships described in the sentence. Our model is based on a variant of graph neural networks called Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), which have been shown to perform well on semantic segmentation tasks. In contrast to previous approaches, we use a dynamic pooling strategy wherein regions of interest in each iteration are selected by an attention mechanism applied to convolutional feature maps. Additionally, we use several techniques to enforce spatial consistency across iterations, such as edge pooling and a novel boundary refinement module that improves contours near object boundaries. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets for instance segmentation and show state-of-the-art results, outperforming other methods using similar architectures but simpler configurations. Finally, we analyze the intermediate features generated during inference to demonstrate the ability of our method to parse semantic scenes.

"The construction of a meaningful graph plays a crucial role in the success of many graph-based representations and algorithms for handling structured data, especially in the emerging field of graph signal processing. However, a meaningful graph is not always readily available from the data, nor easy to define depending on the application domain. In particular, it is often desirable in graph signal processing applications that a graph is chosen such that the data admit certain regularity or smoothness on the graph. In this paper, we address the problem of learning graph Laplacians, which is equivalent to learning graph topologies, such that the input data form graph signals with smooth variations on the resulting topology. To this end, we adopt a factor analysis model for the graph signals and impose a Gaussian probabilistic prior on the latent variables that control these signals. We show that the Gaussian prior leads to an efficient representation that favors the smoothness property of the graph signals. We then propose an algorithm for learning graphs that enforces such property and is based on minimizing the variations of the signals on the learned graph. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data demonstrate that the proposed graph learning framework can efficiently infer meaningful graph topologies from signal observations under the smoothness prior.",0
"In the recent years there has been increasing interest in modeling graph signals using smooth representations such as Fourier and wavelet transforms. These representations offer advantages over classical discrete signal processing methods by capturing the underlying smooth nature of many graph signals arising from real world data. One challenge facing these smooth graph signal representations is that they rely heavily on the Laplacian matrix of the graph, which can become ill conditioned or singular in certain scenarios. This paper focuses on developing new techniques for learning the Laplacian matrix in smooth graph signal representations by incorporating additional information such as eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the graph. We propose two approaches: (i) regularized least squares optimization where we solve for the Laplacian matrix directly and impose additional constraints based on prior knowledge; (ii) iterative refinement method where we first estimate a rough approximation of the Laplacian matrix using readily available algorithms like random walks or Fiedler vector and then improve upon it incrementally until convergence. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across various applications including image classification, biochemical network inference, sensor placement in buildings, etcetera. Overall, our research provides insights into designing efficient algorithms for computing smooth graph signal representations tailored towards specific application domains while addressing challenges posed due to nonlinearities inherent in graphs.",1

By using PRC, we can achieve improved performance in tasks such as image compression, feature extraction, and noise reduction. The proposed method has been evaluated through extensive experimentation, which demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of both efficiency and accuracy compared to existing approaches. Overall, our findings have important implications for the field of computer vision and signal processing, providing a powerful tool for applications that require high levels of precision and speed.",1
"Learning the kernel functions used in kernel methods has been a vastly explored area in machine learning. It is now widely accepted that to obtain 'good' performance, learning a kernel function is the key challenge. In this work we focus on learning kernel representations for structured regression. We propose use of polynomials expansion of kernels, referred to as Schoenberg transforms and Gegenbaur transforms, which arise from the seminal result of Schoenberg (1938). These kernels can be thought of as polynomial combination of input features in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We learn kernels over input and output for structured data, such that, dependency between kernel features is maximized. We use Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure this. We also give an efficient, matrix decomposition-based algorithm to learn these kernel transformations, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets.",0
"This will need to pass Turnitin so no plagiarism please. I am an undergraduate computer science major at Carnegie Mellon University and we don't want any trouble! Thanks! ---  Abstract: This work presents a new method for learning kernels for structured prediction problems using polynomial kernel transformations. The proposed approach leverages recent advances in deep learning and Gaussian process regression to effectively model complex patterns in data while maintaining interpretability and non-parametric flexibility. We demonstrate empirically that our learned kernels can significantly improve upon state-of-the-art baselines across several challenging application domains, including natural language processing, vision, and control tasks. Our contributions provide insights into how to design effective feature maps and regularization schemes tailored specifically for structured output prediction, which may have broader implications beyond the scope of this paper. Overall, these results suggest great promise for our novel polynomial kernel transformation framework as a powerful tool for practitioners working on real-world predictive analytics problems where structure matter most.",1
"The complexity of the visual world creates significant challenges for comprehensive visual understanding. In spite of recent successes in visual recognition, today's vision systems would still struggle to deal with visual queries that require a deeper reasoning. We propose a knowledge base (KB) framework to handle an assortment of visual queries, without the need to train new classifiers for new tasks. Building such a large-scale multimodal KB presents a major challenge of scalability. We cast a large-scale MRF into a KB representation, incorporating visual, textual and structured data, as well as their diverse relations. We introduce a scalable knowledge base construction system that is capable of building a KB with half billion variables and millions of parameters in a few hours. Our system achieves competitive results compared to purpose-built models on standard recognition and retrieval tasks, while exhibiting greater flexibility in answering richer visual queries.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress on developing large-scale knowledge base systems that can effectively answer natural language queries using structured data sources such as RDF graphs and SQL databases. However, these systems have mostly focused on textual information, ignoring other modalities such as images, audio, video, etc. This presents a challenge as more than half of the world’s information is non-textual. To address this issue, we propose building a large-scale multimodal knowledge base system (MMKBS) that allows users to query information across multiple modalities including visual inputs like pictures, videos and diagrams. We present our approach to construct such a MMKB and showcase results from extensive experiments carried out using real world datasets. Our findings indicate that integrating multiple modalities improves the performance of knowledge retrieval by up to 27%. Finally, we discuss future research directions to further advance the field of large-scale MMKBS.",1
"Relational machine learning studies methods for the statistical analysis of relational, or graph-structured, data. In this paper, we provide a review of how such statistical models can be ""trained"" on large knowledge graphs, and then used to predict new facts about the world (which is equivalent to predicting new edges in the graph). In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive datasets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's Knowledge Vault project as an example of such combination.",0
"This review focuses on relational machine learning methods for knowledge graphs. We begin by introducing background material necessary to understanding these techniques: we describe both their use cases, as well as their relationship to graph theory. Next, we provide an overview of current state-of-the art approaches to learning from knowledge graphs using relational models. These approaches can be broadly categorized into two groups: those that rely primarily on matrix factorization, and those that use graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN). Each approach has strengths and weaknesses; thus, careful consideration must be given to choosing which one should be applied for a particular task. After discussing these relational modeling techniques, we consider some additional complications that arise in practice such as scalability issues, computational feasibility, and uncertainty handling. Finally, we conclude with future directions and open research questions related to applying relational machine learning on knowledge graphs.",1
"Tree-structured data usually contain both topological and geometrical information, and are necessarily considered on manifold instead of Euclidean space for appropriate data parameterization and analysis. In this study, we propose a novel tree-structured data parameterization, called Topology-Attribute matrix (T-A matrix), so the data clustering task can be conducted on matrix manifold. We incorporate the structure constraints embedded in data into the negative matrix factorization method to determine meta-trees from the T-A matrix, and the signature vector of each single tree can then be extracted by meta-tree decomposition. The meta-tree space turns out to be a cone space, in which we explore the distance metric and implement the clustering algorithm based on the concepts like Fr\'echet mean. Finally, the T-A matrix based clustering (TAMBAC) framework is evaluated and compared using both simulated data and real retinal images to illustrate its efficiency and accuracy.",0
"In addition to clustering tree-like structures themselves, we can use manifold learning to learn better embeddings of their leaf nodes into lower dimensions while preserving local structure. Here we describe techniques that allow us to generate cluster assignments for all leaf nodes simultaneously that takes both the global (tree) structure and the locally linear relations among leaves into account. We achieve this by first applying a graph partitioning algorithm based on node degree information as well as a modified Cheeger cut objective function to obtain a binary hierarchical clustering dendrogram for each leaf set obtained from our embedding. This allows us to generate any desired number of clusters and cluster assignment at different levels of granularity given some notion of distance threshold between partitions. For visualization purposes we then apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique such as tSNE which maps the low-dimensional leaf node coordinates back to high-dimensional space subject to pointwise constraints ensuring that neighboring points stay neighbors after projection. An advantage over traditional spectral methods for obtaining such embeddings is that no eigendecomposition is required, leading to efficient computation times for even very large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on several benchmark data sets including gene expression profiles from cancer patients and functional neuroimaging data from Alzheimer’s Disease patients using tasks involving memory retrieval. Our results indicate improved performance in terms of Rand Index compared against other popular clustering algorithms and more accurate recovery of known biological pathways in the gene expression case. These ideas have applications beyond just clustering in the context of machine learning problems where capturing underlying structure and topology of data imprecisely represented or sampled fr",1
"The modelling of data on a spherical surface requires the consideration of directional probability distributions. To model asymmetrically distributed data on a three-dimensional sphere, Kent distributions are often used. The moment estimates of the parameters are typically used in modelling tasks involving Kent distributions. However, these lack a rigorous statistical treatment. The focus of the paper is to introduce a Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the Kent distribution which has not been carried out in the literature, partly because of its complex mathematical form. We employ the Bayesian information-theoretic paradigm of Minimum Message Length (MML) to bridge this gap and derive reliable estimators. The inferred parameters are subsequently used in mixture modelling of Kent distributions. The problem of inferring the suitable number of mixture components is also addressed using the MML criterion. We demonstrate the superior performance of the derived MML-based parameter estimates against the traditional estimators. We apply the MML principle to infer mixtures of Kent distributions to model empirical data corresponding to protein conformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Kent models to act as improved descriptors of protein structural data as compared to commonly used von Mises-Fisher distributions.",0
"Abstract: In many applied fields, such as medicine, engineering and economics, there exists an abundance of data that can only take on positive values and follow certain patterns. One common pattern found in these types of datasets is non-increasing density functions, i.e., densities decrease moving from left to right along the support interval. Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to specifying probabilistic models to adequately represent these phenomena. Motivated by this observation, we propose the use of Kent distributions, named after their first appearance in the field of astrophysics, to model positively supported continuous directional data. We discuss properties of both unidimensional and multivariate Kent distributions, including parameter estimation and tests of fit. As expected for any distribution arising from theory, we prove properties like existence of moments and stochastic ordering. Finally, through simulation studies and a real example analysing growth charts, we show good statistical performance in terms of likelihood maximisation and Bayesian posterior distributions. These results suggest suitability of our proposal when modelling positive support data with decreasing density function features.",1
"Deep Learning's recent successes have mostly relied on Convolutional Networks, which exploit fundamental statistical properties of images, sounds and video data: the local stationarity and multi-scale compositional structure, that allows expressing long range interactions in terms of shorter, localized interactions. However, there exist other important examples, such as text documents or bioinformatic data, that may lack some or all of these strong statistical regularities.   In this paper we consider the general question of how to construct deep architectures with small learning complexity on general non-Euclidean domains, which are typically unknown and need to be estimated from the data. In particular, we develop an extension of Spectral Networks which incorporates a Graph Estimation procedure, that we test on large-scale classification problems, matching or improving over Dropout Networks with far less parameters to estimate.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful at modeling graph data across many domains such as social network analysis, computer vision, natural language processing, among others. However, designing efficient GNN architectures remains challenging due to limited parallelism, irregular data structures, and high computational complexity. Inspired by recent advancements in deep learning on image and video data using convolutional neural networks (CNN), we explore whether these principles can be applied to graphs. We present a new framework that generalizes classical CNN operations onto graphs via a novel edge convolution followed by layer normalization. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly while reducing parameter counts and inference time requirements. By exploiting spatial locality underlying large graphs and sharing weights across all edges, our approach achieves greater efficiency compared to existing techniques. Finally, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our architecture through extensive experiments across multiple tasks and datasets including citation networks, coauthorship graphs, and bioinformatics problems. With its superior performance coupled with reduced computation cost, our method has exciting potential for scaling up graph machine learning to larger problems than previously possible.",1
"Many real-world applications are associated with structured data, where not only input but also output has interplay. However, typical classification and regression models often lack the ability of simultaneously exploring high-order interaction within input and that within output. In this paper, we present a deep learning model aiming to generate a powerful nonlinear functional mapping from structured input to structured output. More specifically, we propose to integrate high-order hidden units, guided discriminative pretraining, and high-order auto-encoders for this purpose. We evaluate the model with three datasets, and obtain state-of-the-art performances among competitive methods. Our current work focuses on structured output regression, which is a less explored area, although the model can be extended to handle structured label classification.",0
"A Deep Learning Model (DLM) can generate text descriptions that incorporate high-dimensional dependencies while capturing higher level features such as syntax and semantics. DLMs require large datasets and computational resources, thus have difficulty generalizing on small datasets or handling structured outputs. In contrast, traditional statistical models like Hidden Markov Models provide explicit probabilistic inference and structure which allow them to handle smaller data sets more effectively. Our paper presents an approach combining deep learning methods and graphical modeling techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of generating structured outputs while addressing issues related to resource demands and limited data availability. We evaluate our proposed method using two benchmark datasets; one from natural language processing and another from computer vision tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline models achieving state-of-the-art performance. This work represents an important step towards building powerful machine learning algorithms capable of producing accurate predictions and descriptions for complex problems where little training data is available.",1
"In many applications data is naturally presented in terms of orderings of some basic elements or symbols. Reasoning about such data requires a notion of similarity capable of handling sequences of different lengths. In this paper we describe a family of Mercer kernel functions for such sequentially structured data. The family is characterized by a decomposable structure in terms of symbol-level and structure-level similarities, representing a specific combination of kernels which allows for efficient computation. We provide an experimental evaluation on sequential classification tasks comparing kernels from our family of kernels to a state of the art sequence kernel called the Global Alignment kernel which has been shown to outperform Dynamic Time Warping",0
"This paper presents a new family of decomposable kernels designed specifically for analyzing sequence data. By leveraging recent advances in deep learning techniques, we propose a novel framework that allows for efficient kernel computation while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes predefined distance functions and introduces a parameterization scheme to ensure that our resulting kernels can capture complex nonlinear dependencies present in real-world sequences. We provide comprehensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple applications such as classification, regression, and clustering tasks. In summary, our contributions represent significant progress in the field and offer valuable insights into more effective modeling and analysis of sequential data using machine learning approaches.",1
"We evaluate a version of the recently-proposed classification system named Optimized Dissimilarity Space Embedding (ODSE) that operates in the input space of sequences of generic objects. The ODSE system has been originally presented as a classification system for patterns represented as labeled graphs. However, since ODSE is founded on the dissimilarity space representation of the input data, the classifier can be easily adapted to any input domain where it is possible to define a meaningful dissimilarity measure. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODSE classifier for sequences by considering an application dealing with the recognition of the solubility degree of the Escherichia coli proteome. Solubility, or analogously aggregation propensity, is an important property of protein molecules, which is intimately related to the mechanisms underlying the chemico-physical process of folding. Each protein of our dataset is initially associated with a solubility degree and it is represented as a sequence of symbols, denoting the 20 amino acid residues. The herein obtained computational results, which we stress that have been achieved with no context-dependent tuning of the ODSE system, confirm the validity and generality of the ODSE-based approach for structured data classification.",0
"Solubility plays an important role in understanding protein structure function relationships. High-throughput methods capable of measuring relative protein abundance at different temperatures have been used in several recent studies on protein structure determination using temperature gradients. In this work we present an algorithmic solution to classify protein solubility based on sequence data alone. We use evolutionary rate as a proxy measure of protein complexity which allows us to optimize our method through comparison against well studied systems where the physical property under consideration has already been experimentally characterized. Specifically, we study protein complexes from two organisms with low (Escherichia coli) and high (Haemophilus influenzae) genetic mutation rates to determine how differences in amino acid composition affects protein abundance over time and across environments. Our results indicate that evolutionary rate could serve as a better predictor than amino acid conservation across environmental conditions or even more specific physicochemical properties such as charge and hydrophobicity. Ultimately these findings suggest that optimization in evolution can reveal underlying design principles that cannot otherwise be discovered simply by analyzing static snapshots of protein families.",1
"Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.",0
"This paper presents the first mapping between variational renormalisation group theory (VRG) and deep learning that involves only differentiable models trained using backpropagation. In the past two decades, VRG has been shown to perform better than other methods such as traditional renormalization group approaches at capturing complex physical phenomena while remaining computationally feasible. However, it was not clear until now how VRG could benefit from modern machine learning techniques. We show that any model trained on real world data can be made into a variational renormalisation model by rearranging terms during inference based on the loss function. This result may have profound implications in understanding physical properties of materials, which typically require large scale simulations. Our approach opens up new directions in hybridising these fields. As we demonstrate in our experiments, models trained using this method outperform their counterparts without VRG modifications both quantitatively and qualitatively. While previous attempts at bridging renormalisation with ML were predominantly non-differentiable, in our case, gradients flowing through both the forward pass (model training process) and inverse pass (data generation process via VRG) make it possible to learn more expressive models while still maintaining computational efficiency. Finally, our work provides a unique testbed where existing theories in statistical physics can be applied directly to study neural networks in ways previously unavailable. With applications ranging from condensed matter to quantum field theories, our results suggest a bright future for research involving these areas intersecting. We present evidence suggesting that current developments in these fields might even provide novel solutions to problems encountered in ML. Thus we envision that this wi",1
"We introduce propagation kernels, a general graph-kernel framework for efficiently measuring the similarity of structured data. Propagation kernels are based on monitoring how information spreads through a set of given graphs. They leverage early-stage distributions from propagation schemes such as random walks to capture structural information encoded in node labels, attributes, and edge information. This has two benefits. First, off-the-shelf propagation schemes can be used to naturally construct kernels for many graph types, including labeled, partially labeled, unlabeled, directed, and attributed graphs. Second, by leveraging existing efficient and informative propagation schemes, propagation kernels can be considerably faster than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing predictive performance. We will also show that if the graphs at hand have a regular structure, for instance when modeling image or video data, one can exploit this regularity to scale the kernel computation to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes. We support our contributions by exhaustive experiments on a number of real-world graphs from a variety of application domains.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to modeling how information spreads through populations, known as propagation kernels. Drawing on techniques from graph theory and information science, we develop a general framework for representing the flow of information across networks of any kind. Our method can capture both the structure of these networks and the dynamics of how they change over time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to several real-world examples, including social media diffusion, disease outbreaks, and viral marketing campaigns. By providing a unified perspective on information spreading phenomena, our work paves the way for more accurate predictions of how information flows throughout society. Additionally, since our framework is modular and easy to use, it has potential applications in many different fields where understanding information transmission is important. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into the complex processes that shape public opinion, consumer behavior, and other critical aspects of modern life.",1
"Unsupervised ranking faces one critical challenge in evaluation applications, that is, no ground truth is available. When PageRank and its variants show a good solution in related subjects, they are applicable only for ranking from link-structure data. In this work, we focus on unsupervised ranking from multi-attribute data which is also common in evaluation tasks. To overcome the challenge, we propose five essential meta-rules for the design and assessment of unsupervised ranking approaches: scale and translation invariance, strict monotonicity, linear/nonlinear capacities, smoothness, and explicitness of parameter size. These meta-rules are regarded as high level knowledge for unsupervised ranking tasks. Inspired by the works in [8] and [14], we propose a ranking principal curve (RPC) model, which learns a one-dimensional manifold function to perform unsupervised ranking tasks on multi-attribute observations. Furthermore, the RPC is modeled to be a cubic B\'ezier curve with control points restricted in the interior of a hypercube, thereby complying with all the five meta-rules to infer a reasonable ranking list. With control points as the model parameters, one is able to understand the learned manifold and to interpret the ranking list semantically. Numerical experiments of the presented RPC model are conducted on two open datasets of different ranking applications. In comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the new model is able to show more reasonable ranking lists.",0
"This study presents an unsupervised method for ranking multi-attribute objects based on principal curves. We assume that there exists some underlying relationship among attributes, which can be modeled as monotonic functions of one variable called ""score"". The main idea consists of mapping object vectors onto their corresponding scores through these functions by finding local minima of a loss function designed to preserve global rankings while optimizing local error at each point using gradient descent. Evaluation shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art models trained with labeled data.",1
"The need for appropriate ways to measure the distance or similarity between data is ubiquitous in machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining, but handcrafting such good metrics for specific problems is generally difficult. This has led to the emergence of metric learning, which aims at automatically learning a metric from data and has attracted a lot of interest in machine learning and related fields for the past ten years. This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the metric learning literature, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We pay particular attention to Mahalanobis distance metric learning, a well-studied and successful framework, but additionally present a wide range of methods that have recently emerged as powerful alternatives, including nonlinear metric learning, similarity learning and local metric learning. Recent trends and extensions, such as semi-supervised metric learning, metric learning for histogram data and the derivation of generalization guarantees, are also covered. Finally, this survey addresses metric learning for structured data, in particular edit distance learning, and attempts to give an overview of the remaining challenges in metric learning for the years to come.",0
"This should be a research paper. A survey was conducted on metric learning for feature vectors and structured data by collecting datasets from different domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, bioinformatics etc. The dataset includes images, texts, graphs, trees and more that have been transformed into feature vectors through manual feature engineering or deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer based architectures. Experiments were performed using several state-of-the-art algorithms under various settings (e.g., semi-supervised learning vs supervised learning, batch mode vs online learning). In addition, we evaluated their performance on different distance measures and regularization terms used in loss functions, demonstrating how these choices can affect the final results of metric learning problems. To facilitate further study on metric learning, our code, datasets and visualizations are publicly available at GitHub and demo website. Lastly, we provide future directions on how metric learning can benefit even more fields if integrated with deep learning techniques and structured prediction models. Overall, this work aims to bridge the gap between recent advances in metric learning theory and real world applications so practitioners and researchers alike can find solutions efficiently and effectively.",1
"Dealing with structured data needs the use of expressive representation formalisms that, however, puts the problem to deal with the computational complexity of the machine learning process. Furthermore, real world domains require tools able to manage their typical uncertainty. Many statistical relational learning approaches try to deal with these problems by combining the construction of relevant relational features with a probabilistic tool. When the combination is static (static propositionalization), the constructed features are considered as boolean features and used offline as input to a statistical learner; while, when the combination is dynamic (dynamic propositionalization), the feature construction and probabilistic tool are combined into a single process. In this paper we propose a selective propositionalization method that search the optimal set of relational features to be used by a probabilistic learner in order to minimize a loss function. The new propositionalization approach has been combined with the random subspace ensemble method. Experiments on real-world datasets shows the validity of the proposed method.",0
"In recent years there has been increased interest in using machine learning algorithms to model complex relational structures from large datasets. One approach that has gained popularity is ensemble relational learning (ERL), which involves training multiple models and combining their predictions through ensembling techniques such as majority voting. However, a common problem faced by ERL methods is overfitting due to high complexity of modern neural network architectures, as well as the difficulty of tuning hyperparameters effectively across many models. To address these issues we propose selective propositionalization: a novel technique designed to increase interpretability and transparency without sacrificing performance. By selecting relevant features at different levels of abstraction from raw data, selective propositionalization enables effective feature engineering tailored specifically for each ERM component. We experimentally evaluate our method compared to several state-of-the-art baselines across four benchmark datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement in both accuracy and diversity metrics. Our findings have important implications for designing more efficient and robust frameworks for ensemble relational learning, advancing the broader goal of developing intelligent systems capable of handling human-like understanding tasks under uncertainty and ambiguity.",1
"In structured output learning, obtaining labelled data for real-world applications is usually costly, while unlabelled examples are available in abundance. Semi-supervised structured classification has been developed to handle large amounts of unlabelled structured data. In this work, we consider semi-supervised structural SVMs with domain constraints. The optimization problem, which in general is not convex, contains the loss terms associated with the labelled and unlabelled examples along with the domain constraints. We propose a simple optimization approach, which alternates between solving a supervised learning problem and a constraint matching problem. Solving the constraint matching problem is difficult for structured prediction, and we propose an efficient and effective hill-climbing method to solve it. The alternating optimization is carried out within a deterministic annealing framework, which helps in effective constraint matching, and avoiding local minima which are not very useful. The algorithm is simple to implement and achieves comparable generalization performance on benchmark datasets.",0
"Title: Improving Semi-Supervised Learning for Structured Outputs through Large Margin Training  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular approach for tackling problems where labeled data is scarce. One key challenge with SSL methods lies in handling structured outputs, which require complex models that capture dependencies across multiple elements. Traditional approaches often struggle to learn accurate representations using limited supervision alone. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised method called Large Margin Semi-supervised Structured Output Learning (LSML) to improve SSL performance on structured output tasks. Our technique combines two complementary ideas: large margin learning for improved model robustness and structured regularization that encourages better parameter sharing among similar model components. We demonstrate LSML's effectiveness by applying it to several real-world benchmark datasets commonly used in natural language processing and computer vision applications. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing more reliable and generalizable predictions while utilizing only small amounts of annotated training data. This research advances our understanding of how to design SSL algorithms capable of handling high-dimensional, structured prediction tasks under severe resource constraints.",1
"In this paper, we present two localized graph filtering based methods for interpolating graph signals defined on the vertices of arbitrary graphs from only a partial set of samples. The first method is an extension of previous work on reconstructing bandlimited graph signals from partially observed samples. The iterative graph filtering approach very closely approximates the solution proposed in the that work, while being computationally more efficient. As an alternative, we propose a regularization based framework in which we define the cost of reconstruction to be a combination of smoothness of the graph signal and the reconstruction error with respect to the known samples, and find solutions that minimize this cost. We provide both a closed form solution and a computationally efficient iterative solution of the optimization problem. The experimental results on the recommendation system datasets demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed methods.",0

Please write this as a third person summary of the results - so use active voice wherever possible: e.g. we found XYZ rather than ""the study showed"". Localized iterative methods for interpolation in graph structured data have been developed by scientists from prestigious universities across Europe. These new techniques allow for high precision interpolations within large datasets which contain intricate relationships. As such, these novel approaches will be particularly beneficial to fields where complex systems frequently require analysis such as finance, engineering and physics. In particular our research has demonstrated that using localized iterative methods leads to significantly improved accuracy over existing approaches. Overall these findings have significant implications in both academia and industry due to the substantially enhanced potential performance in computational processing. -----",1
"Tensor factorizations have become increasingly popular approaches for various learning tasks on structured data. In this work, we extend the RESCAL tensor factorization, which has shown state-of-the-art results for multi-relational learning, to account for the binary nature of adjacency tensors. We study the improvements that can be gained via this approach on various benchmark datasets and show that the logistic extension can improve the prediction results significantly.",0
"One challenge in data mining is discovering patterns among collections of entities that come from different types (e.g., transactions and customers). Classical relational learning techniques are based on the assumption that there exist some hidden essential relations which can provide exact matches; however, many real-world relationships have only loose associations. In recent years, latent factor models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have proven successful in capturing subtle nuances underlying unstructured text collection. This research adapts these ideas to multi-relational datasets by creating latent factors which capture high-level semantics but do not necessarily coincide with any individual attribute, entity type, or relationship type. Given several input tables representing related domains, our model simultaneously learns latent factors which inform new links between instances across all tables while minimizing reconstruction errors for each individual table independently. Our evaluation shows significant improvements over current state-of-the-art methods using both synthetic experiments and multiple standard benchmark sets drawn from diverse fields.",1
"Large-scale relational learning becomes crucial for handling the huge amounts of structured data generated daily in many application domains ranging from computational biology or information retrieval, to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link prediction on standard datasets from the literature.",0
"This is the abstract I would like you to write:  This paper proposes a new framework called CINNAMON (Continuous Integration of Neural Networks via Manifold Oriented Model Optimization) that learns neural networks by directly minimizing a continuous relaxation of a discrete objective function defined over the space of neural network weights that maps each model into either -1 if the prediction quality is below some threshold value on held out data or else +1 if above such threshold. Since we can take any such non-convex optimization problem and obtain lower bounds at every iteration through sampling methods such as Monte Carlo gradient estimation, our approach allows us to perform semi-continuous learning without the need to retrain from scratch and with only simple backpropagation-like passes required for updating model parameters using SGD or other standard gradient-based optimization algorithms. Empirical evaluation shows that compared to baselines utilized state-of-the art models trained end-to-end, training times were reduced while maintaining comparable test performance results which demonstrates the promise of our methodology. Our proposed technique provides a path towards realizing large scale deployment of machine learning systems under tight resource constraints where the ability to incrementally improve system quality based on feedback data that becomes available during operation, rather than relying solely on pre-defined static training sets. Additionally, because our formulation makes explicit use of auxiliary ""manifold"" features extracted from the input data that capture higher order relations between elements within the dataset but are otherwise unused, our work may also serve as foundation for further study of how better to integrate high level structured knowledge/information sources with deep generative mod",1
"This paper investigates graph clustering in the planted cluster model in the presence of {\em small clusters}. Traditional results dictate that for an algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, {\em all} clusters must be sufficiently large (in particular, $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined analysis of the trace-norm based recovery approach proposed in Jalali et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assumptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones.   Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm to recover {\em almost all clusters} via a ""peeling strategy"", i.e., recover large clusters first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure. These results are extended to the {\em partial observation} setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed.The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned (and removed).   From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimensional statistics and learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxationsdoes the job.",0
"Graph clustering has been a popular technique for identifying clusters in large data sets, particularly as networks have grown increasingly complex in recent years. However, many graph clustering algorithms suffer from two limitations: their running time increases exponentially as the number of nodes increases, making them impractical for very large graphs; and they only find clusters up to a certain size limit known as the small cluster barrier. This paper presents an algorithm that overcomes these limitations by first partitioning the graph into smaller subgraphs and then applying standard clustering techniques on each subgraph individually before merging the results. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach can effectively identify clusters of any size while significantly reducing computation time compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Traditional relation extraction predicts relations within some fixed and finite target schema. Machine learning approaches to this task require either manual annotation or, in the case of distant supervision, existing structured sources of the same schema. The need for existing datasets can be avoided by using a universal schema: the union of all involved schemas (surface form predicates as in OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of pre-existing databases). This schema has an almost unlimited set of relations (due to surface forms), and supports integration with existing structured data (through the relation types of existing databases). To populate a database of such schema we present a family of matrix factorization models that predict affinity between database tuples and relations. We show that this achieves substantially higher accuracy than the traditional classification approach. More importantly, by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways. By doing so our approach outperforms state-of-the-art distant supervision systems.",0
"Title: ""Universal Schemas through Latent Relation Representations""  Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing models that can learn and represent complex relationships within large amounts of text data. However, many of these models focus on specific domains or tasks, and may struggle to generalize to new types of content. In order to address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that uses latent relation representations (LRRs) to automatically induce universal schemas that capture fundamental relationships across diverse domains. Our method leverages unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns in natural language and generate LRRs that effectively capture high-level semantic relations between entities. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both schema induction and zero-shot cross-domain transferability. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards developing more flexible and adaptive text processing systems that can tackle increasingly diverse data sources and applications.",1
"In practical machine learning systems, graph based data representation has been widely used in various learning paradigms, ranging from unsupervised clustering to supervised classification. Besides those applications with natural graph or network structure data, such as social network analysis and relational learning, many other applications often involve a critical step in converting data vectors to an adjacency graph. In particular, a sparse subgraph extracted from the original graph is often required due to both theoretic and practical needs. Previous study clearly shows that the performance of different learning algorithms, e.g., clustering and classification, benefits from such sparse subgraphs with balanced node connectivity. However, the existing graph construction methods are either computationally expensive or with unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we utilize a scalable method called auction algorithm and its parallel extension to recover a sparse yet nearly balanced subgraph with significantly reduced computational cost. Empirical study and comparison with the state-ofart approaches clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both efficiency and accuracy.",0
"In recent years, graph construction has become increasingly important as graphs have grown larger and more complex. However, traditional methods such as breadth first search (BFS) and depth first search (DFS) can become time consuming and impractical. To address this challenge, we propose a new algorithm called the auction algorithm which outperforms existing methods by providing faster results while maintaining accuracy.  The auction algorithm works by simulating a market where each vertex acts as a buyer, and edges represent items that they purchase from other vertices. Each vertex starts with a fixed budget, and at every step, it bids on multiple items until it runs out of money. We prove that after a finite number of steps, there exists a set of vertex subsets whose union contains all original vertices, making the auction algorithm ideal for constructing large, connected graphs quickly. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to BFS and DFS on both real-world datasets and synthetic benchmarks. Overall, the auction algorithm provides a significant improvement over previous techniques for fast and accurate graph construction.",1
"Collective classification models attempt to improve classification performance by taking into account the class labels of related instances. However, they tend not to learn patterns of interactions between classes and/or make the assumption that instances of the same class link to each other (assortativity assumption). Blockmodels provide a solution to these issues, being capable of modelling assortative and disassortative interactions, and learning the pattern of interactions in the form of a summary network. The Supervised Blockmodel provides good classification performance using link structure alone, whilst simultaneously providing an interpretable summary of network interactions to allow a better understanding of the data. This work explores three variants of supervised blockmodels of varying complexity and tests them on four structurally different real world networks.",0
"Blockmodeling (Hendrickx & Cools, 2014) is a powerful method used in psychology to analyze complex social networks by breaking them down into smaller blocks based on certain criteria. However, one limitation of traditional blockmodeling methods is that they often rely on unsupervised learning techniques which can sometimes produce results that may not align well with theoretical expectations. To address these limitations, we propose supervised blockmodeling as a new approach that allows researchers to incorporate prior knowledge and hypotheses directly into the model building process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through simulation studies and illustrate its application using two empirical datasets. Our findings suggest that supervised blockmodeling provides more accurate estimates of network structures and improves the ability to test specific theories in social network analysis. Overall, this work contributes to the development of novel tools for analyzing complex social systems and has implications for understanding how relationships among individuals shape group behavior.",1
"High dimensional structured data such as text and images is often poorly understood and misrepresented in statistical modeling. The standard histogram representation suffers from high variance and performs poorly in general. We explore novel connections between statistical translation, heat kernels on manifolds and graphs, and expected distances. These connections provide a new framework for unsupervised metric learning for text documents. Experiments indicate that the resulting distances are generally superior to their more standard counterparts.",0
"In recent years, statistical translation models have gained popularity due to their ability to accurately translate text from one language to another without relying on explicit grammar rules or syntax. These models use large amounts of data to learn the relationships between different languages, allowing them to effectively capture the nuances of natural language. This work presents a new approach to statistical translation that utilizes heat kernels and expected distances. By analyzing the similarities and differences between pairs of sentences in each language, we can better understand how they relate to one another and develop more accurate translations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets. Our results show significant improvement over existing methods, highlighting the potential benefits of using heat kernels and expected distances in statistical translation tasks. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of research on machine translation and has implications for real-world applications such as communication across language barriers and accessibility for non-native speakers.",1
"High-dimensional data common in genomics, proteomics, and chemometrics often contains complicated correlation structures. Recently, partial least squares (PLS) and Sparse PLS methods have gained attention in these areas as dimension reduction techniques in the context of supervised data analysis. We introduce a framework for Regularized PLS by solving a relaxation of the SIMPLS optimization problem with penalties on the PLS loadings vectors. Our approach enjoys many advantages including flexibility, general penalties, easy interpretation of results, and fast computation in high-dimensional settings. We also outline extensions of our methods leading to novel methods for Non-negative PLS and Generalized PLS, an adaption of PLS for structured data. We demonstrate the utility of our methods through simulations and a case study on proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data.",0
"Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to process complex data sets such as those produced by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. One popular method that has recently gained attention is partial least squares regression (PLS). PLS uses latent variables to predict target values based on two matrices, X and Y. An alternative approach called regularized PLS or rPLS further improves performance by minimizing the complexity of these latent structures. This study explores the use of rPLS applied to simulated and real NMR spectral datasets. Results show significant improvements over traditional methods using cross-validation techniques to evaluate model accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating machine learning approaches into biochemical research. Overall, this work contributes valuable insights into the application of statistical analysis and data mining methods to improve our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level.",1
"High-dimensional tensors or multi-way data are becoming prevalent in areas such as biomedical imaging, chemometrics, networking and bibliometrics. Traditional approaches to finding lower dimensional representations of tensor data include flattening the data and applying matrix factorizations such as principal components analysis (PCA) or employing tensor decompositions such as the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions. The former can lose important structure in the data, while the latter Higher-Order PCA (HOPCA) methods can be problematic in high-dimensions with many irrelevant features. We introduce frameworks for sparse tensor factorizations or Sparse HOPCA based on heuristic algorithmic approaches and by solving penalized optimization problems related to the CP decomposition. Extensions of these approaches lead to methods for general regularized tensor factorizations, multi-way Functional HOPCA and generalizations of HOPCA for structured data. We illustrate the utility of our methods for dimension reduction, feature selection, and signal recovery on simulated data and multi-dimensional microarrays and functional MRIs.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models that can effectively capture the underlying structure of complex data sets. One approach to achieving this goal is through tensor factorization methods, which aim to decompose a high-dimensional tensor into simpler constituent parts. However, many existing tensor factorization algorithms suffer from limitations such as computational intractability, difficulties in handling missing values or noise, and sensitivity to initialization. In this work, we introduce regularized tensor factorizations (RTFs) and higher-order principal components analysis (HOPCA), two novel approaches that address these challenges. RTFs incorporate Lasso regularization to promote sparse representations and improve interpretability, while HOPCA extends traditional PCA to tensors by maximizing the cumulative variance explained across multiple modes. Our experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in recovering interpretable structures, outperforming several state-of-the-art alternatives. These contributions further expand the frontier of big data modeling, unlocking exciting new possibilities in scientific discovery, business intelligence, and other applications.",1
"Recent results in Compressive Sensing have shown that, under certain conditions, the solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations with sparsity-based regularization can be accurately recovered by solving convex relaxations of the original problem. In this work, we present a novel primal-dual analysis on a class of sparsity minimization problems. We show that the Lagrangian bidual (i.e., the Lagrangian dual of the Lagrangian dual) of the sparsity minimization problems can be used to derive interesting convex relaxations: the bidual of the $\ell_0$-minimization problem is the $\ell_1$-minimization problem; and the bidual of the $\ell_{0,1}$-minimization problem for enforcing group sparsity on structured data is the $\ell_{1,\infty}$-minimization problem. The analysis provides a means to compute per-instance non-trivial lower bounds on the (group) sparsity of the desired solutions. In a real-world application, the bidual relaxation improves the performance of a sparsity-based classification framework applied to robust face recognition.",0
"In this paper we consider two fundamental problems: finding the sparsest solution of a linear system of equations Ax=b where A is of size n×m, x is an n-dimensional vector, b is an m-dimensional vector and solving the dual problem which minimizes ||x||_2^2 subject to constaints given by Ax=b This duality has been studied from several perspectives including optimization theory, statistics and machine learning where these constraints arise in applications such as denoising, regression and support vector machines. We present a new characterization that shows how these two problems can be viewed through their respective biduals defined by Lagrange multipliers (λ,v). Our main results establish relationships between (A,b) and v, between uand the primal optimal solutions and between λ and v via optimality conditions based on subdifferential calculus. These insights lead to the construction of novel algorithms to obtain all primal and dual optimal solutions and Lagrange multipliers of these problems without any constraint qualifications. Numerical experiments show promising results in terms of accuracy and speed compared to existing solvers used today.",1
"We describe many vantage points on the Baire metric and its use in clustering data, or its use in preprocessing and structuring data in order to support search and retrieval operations. In some cases, we proceed directly to clusters and do not directly determine the distances. We show how a hierarchical clustering can be read directly from one pass through the data. We offer insights also on practical implications of precision of data measurement. As a mechanism for treating multidimensional data, including very high dimensional data, we use random projections.",0
"In our paper we present a novel approach to hierarchical clustering that combines fast linear time complexity with flexibility and robustness. Our method is based on the use of a new distance measure called the Baire metric which is defined on any complete separable metric space X. We show how to extend this metric to define a family of metrics parameterized by some integer constant ""m"". This allows us to interpolate between different levels of granularity in the resulting hierarchy. The algorithm itself proceeds iteratively at each step merging two clusters according to their nearest neighbors identified via this Baire metric. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic data sets as well as large scale real world problems such as image retrieval and sensor network localization, that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results while offering significant advantages over other methods. Furthermore we establish connections between these ideas and several other areas within mathematical computer science including generalized ultrametrics hashing formal concept analysis and precision of data measurement thus illustrating the breadth of applicability of these concepts.",1
"Recently there is a line of research work proposing to employ Spectral Clustering (SC) to segment (group){Throughout the paper, we use segmentation, clustering, and grouping, and their verb forms, interchangeably.} high-dimensional structural data such as those (approximately) lying on subspaces {We follow {liu2010robust} and use the term ""subspace"" to denote both linear subspaces and affine subspaces. There is a trivial conversion between linear subspaces and affine subspaces as mentioned therein.} or low-dimensional manifolds. By learning the affinity matrix in the form of sparse reconstruction, techniques proposed in this vein often considerably boost the performance in subspace settings where traditional SC can fail. Despite the success, there are fundamental problems that have been left unsolved: the spectrum property of the learned affinity matrix cannot be gauged in advance, and there is often one ugly symmetrization step that post-processes the affinity for SC input. Hence we advocate to enforce the symmetric positive semidefinite constraint explicitly during learning (Low-Rank Representation with Positive SemiDefinite constraint, or LRR-PSD), and show that factually it can be solved in an exquisite scheme efficiently instead of general-purpose SDP solvers that usually scale up poorly. We provide rigorous mathematical derivations to show that, in its canonical form, LRR-PSD is equivalent to the recently proposed Low-Rank Representation (LRR) scheme {liu2010robust}, and hence offer theoretic and practical insights to both LRR-PSD and LRR, inviting future research. As per the computational cost, our proposal is at most comparable to that of LRR, if not less. We validate our theoretic analysis and optimization scheme by experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.",0
"A low rank subspace segmentation approach robust to outliers has been developed, ensuring semidefinite guarantees. The proposed method utilizes a nuclear norm penalty on the singular values of the matrix factors obtained from a low rank approximation of the data matrix. By combining this with a recovery guarantee based on restricted principal component analysis, we provide theoretical support demonstrating that our algorithm can accurately separate any underlying segments corrupted by arbitrary noise of high magnitude. We demonstrate via experiments on both synthetic and real datasets the improved performance our method provides over state-of-the art alternatives.",1
"The major challenge in designing a discriminative learning algorithm for predicting structured data is to address the computational issues arising from the exponential size of the output space. Existing algorithms make different assumptions to ensure efficient, polynomial time estimation of model parameters. For several combinatorial structures, including cycles, partially ordered sets, permutations and other graph classes, these assumptions do not hold. In this thesis, we address the problem of designing learning algorithms for predicting combinatorial structures by introducing two new assumptions: (i) The first assumption is that a particular counting problem can be solved efficiently. The consequence is a generalisation of the classical ridge regression for structured prediction. (ii) The second assumption is that a particular sampling problem can be solved efficiently. The consequence is a new technique for designing and analysing probabilistic structured prediction models. These results can be applied to solve several complex learning problems including but not limited to multi-label classification, multi-category hierarchical classification, and label ranking.",0
"This abstract presents our work on predicting combinatorial structures from input text data using deep learning techniques. We first describe the challenge involved in modeling these types of structured outputs and explain why current methods fall short. Next, we outline our approach which uses a novel attention mechanism that allows us to focus on relevant parts of the input while generating the output structure. Finally, we discuss preliminary results obtained on several benchmark datasets showing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art systems. These encouraging results suggest that our method can form a valuable component of future natural language processing pipelines involving structured predictions. (word count: 298) ---",1
"Deep learning on graphs has recently achieved remarkable success on a variety of tasks, while such success relies heavily on the massive and carefully labeled data. However, precise annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, self-supervised learning (SSL) is emerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. In this survey, we extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive review of existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide existing graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and predictive. More importantly, unlike other surveys that only provide a high-level description of published research, we present an additional mathematical summary of existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore, to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, open-source implementations, and experimental study of various algorithms. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges and potential future directions for improving graph self-supervised learning. Latest advances in graph SSL are summarized in a GitHub repository https://github.com/LirongWu/awesome-graph-self-supervised-learning.",0
"This paper presents three different techniques using self-supervised learning on graphs and compares their effectiveness. We first describe the basic concepts behind each method (contrastive, generative, predictive) and then provide examples and comparisons against one another. Each approach has unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the nature of the data. Finally, we conclude by discussing future directions and potential applications.",1
"We focus on the problem of segmenting a certain object referred by a natural language sentence in video content, at the core of formulating a pinpoint vision-language relation. While existing attempts mainly construct such relation in an implicit way, i.e., grid-level multi-modal feature fusion, it has been proven problematic to distinguish semantically similar objects under this paradigm. In this work, we propose to interwind the visual and linguistic modalities in an explicit way via the contrastive learning objective, which directly aligns the referred object and the language description and separates the unreferred content apart across frames. Moreover, to remedy for the degradation problem, we present two complementary hard instance mining strategies, i.e., Language-relevant Channel Filter and Relative Hard Instance Construction. They encourage the network to exclude visual-distinguishable feature and to focus on easy-confused objects during the contrastive training. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, i.e., A2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences, quantitatively demonstrate the state-of-the-arts performance of our method and qualitatively show the more accurate distinguishment between semantically similar objects over baselines.",0
"Our new method automatically separates video into clips based on natural language input. While state-of-the-art methods require complex training data and supervision for fine-grained segmentation of videos by hand, ours can work unsupervised from raw audio tracks. We first encode audio into continuous representations using established techniques such as wav2vec 2.0. Using these embeddings, we then learn how to apply soft attention masks over time, producing explicit labels which can distinguish distinct events. These masks guide a temporal convolutional network that produces the final sequence of clip tokens.",1
"Managing large numbers of incoming bug reports and finding the most critical issues in hardware development is time consuming, but crucial in order to reduce development costs. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the time to fix, the risk and the complexity of debugging and resolution of a bug report using different supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, MLP and XGBoost. Further, we investigate the effect of the application of active learning and we evaluate the impact of different text representation techniques, namely TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Universal Sentence Encoder and XLNet on the model's performance. The evaluation shows that a combination of text embeddings generated through the Universal Sentence Encoder and MLP as classifier outperforms all other methods, and is well suited to predict the risk and complexity of bug tickets.",0
"As hardware development becomes increasingly complex, efficient bug tracking solutions have become essential for ensuring that projects stay on track and meet their deadlines.

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of NLP techniques that can be utilized to create a modern bug tracking system tailored to the specific needs of hardware development teams. We discuss important considerations for effective implementation of these techniques, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, classification algorithms, and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we provide case studies demonstrating real-world applications of our proposed approach to illustrate how NLP can enhance bug tracking capabilities in practice. Our findings highlight the significant potential of NLP for improving collaboration and efficiency within the hardware development domain.",1
"Robots are becoming everyday devices, increasing their interaction with humans. To make human-machine interaction more natural, cognitive features like Visual Voice Activity Detection (VVAD), which can detect whether a person is speaking or not, given visual input of a camera, need to be implemented. Neural networks are state of the art for tasks in Image Processing, Time Series Prediction, Natural Language Processing and other domains. Those Networks require large quantities of labeled data. Currently there are not many datasets for the task of VVAD. In this work we created a large scale dataset called the VVAD-LRS3 dataset, derived by automatic annotations from the LRS3 dataset. The VVAD-LRS3 dataset contains over 44K samples, over three times the next competitive dataset (WildVVAD). We evaluate different baselines on four kinds of features: facial and lip images, and facial and lip landmark features. With a Convolutional Neural Network Long Short Term Memory (CNN LSTM) on facial images an accuracy of 92% was reached on the test set. A study with humans showed that they reach an accuracy of 87.93% on the test set.",0
"This dataset contains audio files that have been annotated by human labelers who indicated which parts of each file contained voices speaking in different languages. These labels were then used as training data to train deep learning models that can automatically detect whether any given audio file contains speech. Testing showed good results - F1 scores ranging from .84 on a small validation set up to .92 on a larger held out test set of random speakers, across all five languages present in our corpus (English, Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic). While these scores represent improvements over prior work using other methods, they also confirm that performance varies depending on factors such as microphone placement and ambient noise conditions. Further investigation into ways to improve generalization of trained models beyond their initial distribution of input stimuli may lead to even better results. We plan to make this dataset publicly available so others may build upon our work and use the same task setup.

"Transformer architecture has emerged to be successful in a number of natural language processing tasks. However, its applications to medical vision remain largely unexplored. In this study, we present UTNet, a simple yet powerful hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates self-attention into a convolutional neural network for enhancing medical image segmentation. UTNet applies self-attention modules in both encoder and decoder for capturing long-range dependency at different scales with minimal overhead. To this end, we propose an efficient self-attention mechanism along with relative position encoding that reduces the complexity of self-attention operation significantly from $O(n^2)$ to approximate $O(n)$. A new self-attention decoder is also proposed to recover fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the encoder. Our approach addresses the dilemma that Transformer requires huge amounts of data to learn vision inductive bias. Our hybrid layer design allows the initialization of Transformer into convolutional networks without a need of pre-training. We have evaluated UTNet on the multi-label, multi-vendor cardiac magnetic resonance imaging cohort. UTNet demonstrates superior segmentation performance and robustness against the state-of-the-art approaches, holding the promise to generalize well on other medical image segmentations.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for medical image segmentation tasks. Among the many architectures used for these tasks, transformer models have gained popularity due to their ability to effectively capture global dependencies and achieve state-of-the-art results. However, one limitation of pure transformer models lies in their limited contextual capacity compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To address this gap, we propose UTNet, which combines both CNN and transformer blocks into a hybrid architecture that provides rich local context while maintaining global dependencies. Our approach outperforms previous methods across various benchmark datasets and achieves superior results in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, our model requires fewer parameters than other transformer-based approaches without sacrificing performance. This work paves the way towards future research exploring hybrid architectures combining CNNs and transformers for improved medical image analysis.",1
"Transformers are state-of-the-art deep learning models that are composed of stacked attention and point-wise, fully connected layers designed for handling sequential data.

"Transformer-based architectures have become the de-facto standard models for a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their memory footprint and high latency are prohibitive for efficient deployment and inference on resource-limited devices. In this work, we explore quantization for transformers. We show that transformers have unique quantization challenges -- namely, high dynamic activation ranges that are difficult to represent with a low bit fixed-point format. We establish that these activations contain structured outliers in the residual connections that encourage specific attention patterns, such as attending to the special separator token. To combat these challenges, we present three solutions based on post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, each with a different set of compromises for accuracy, model size, and ease of use. In particular, we introduce a novel quantization scheme -- per-embedding-group quantization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the GLUE benchmark using BERT, establishing state-of-the-art results for post-training quantization. Finally, we show that transformer weights and embeddings can be quantized to ultra-low bit-widths, leading to significant memory savings with a minimum accuracy loss. Our source code is available at~\url{https://github.com/qualcomm-ai-research/transformer-quantization}.",0
"As neural networks grow increasingly complex, their computational demands have increased dramatically, requiring ever more specialized hardware configurations to run efficiently. One promising approach to making these models faster has been quantization - reducing floating-point weights down to integers while preserving as much accuracy as possible. However, applying these methods efficiently remains a significant challenge due to several key factors: First, traditional approaches often focus on speedup above all else, sacrificing model quality in some cases; Second, even highly efficient approaches can still struggle under resource constraints that are commonplace in many real world applications; Finally, there exist additional obstacles such as non-linear activation functions, which further complicate attempts at quantization. This work explores recent advances aimed at addressing each of these challenges head-on. By leveraging novel weight scaling schemes and approximation techniques along with pruning, we show that we can achieve impressive tradeoffs between efficiency and quality across both image classification and language generation tasks. Furthermore, our proposed techniques adaptively balance the number of bits used for encoding different parameters, enabling greater flexibility during deployment. Combined together, these results demonstrate clear progress toward making large transformer models viable within a wider range of contexts than was previously feasible. To summarize, effective quantization is crucial given the growing prevalence of big data and machine learning, but existing approaches either trade off too much performance or don’t account fo",1
"Standard training via empirical risk minimization (ERM) can produce models that achieve high accuracy on average but low accuracy on certain groups, especially in the presence of spurious correlations between the input and label. Prior approaches that achieve high worst-group accuracy, like group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) require expensive group annotations for each training point, whereas approaches that do not use such group annotations typically achieve unsatisfactory worst-group accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple two-stage approach, JTT, that first trains a standard ERM model for several epochs, and then trains a second model that upweights the training examples that the first model misclassified. Intuitively, this upweights examples from groups on which standard ERM models perform poorly, leading to improved worst-group performance. Averaged over four image classification and natural language processing tasks with spurious correlations, JTT closes 75% of the gap in worst-group accuracy between standard ERM and group DRO, while only requiring group annotations on a small validation set in order to tune hyperparameters.",0
"Improving robustness against adversarial attacks has been a critical challenge in deep learning research. Recently, several methods have emerged that leverage group regularization techniques to train models such that they perform well across multiple input groups. However, these approaches typically require training on diverse group information which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel method called ""Just Train Twice"" (JTT) where only two sets of data are used for training instead. Our approach involves adding random noise to one set of data to create virtual auxiliary classes that act as surrogates for real groups. This allows us to learn representations that generalize better under distribution shifts without explicitly leveraging true group labels. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art group regularization methods while significantly reducing computational requirements. Overall, our findings highlight the potential effectiveness and efficiency benefits of JTT for improving model robustness in the face of adversarial attacks.",1
"Internet of Things (IoT)-based indoor localization has gained significant popularity recently to satisfy the ever-increasing requirements of indoor Location-based Services (LBS). In this context, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based localization is of interest as it provides a scalable solution independent of any proprietary sensors/modules. Existing IMU-based methodologies, however, are mainly developed based on statistical heading and step length estimation techniques that suffer from cumulative error issues and have extensive computational time requirements limiting their application for real-time indoor positioning. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose the Online Dynamic Window (ODW)-assisted two-stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) localization framework. Three ODWs are proposed, where the first model uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-inspired Dynamic Window (DW) approach, which significantly reduces the required computational time. The second framework is developed based on a Signal Processing Dynamic Windowing (SP-DW) approach to further reduce the required processing time of the two-stage LSTM-based model. The third ODW, referred to as the SP-NLP, combines the first two windowing mechanisms to further improve the overall achieved accuracy. Compared to the traditional LSTM-based positioning approaches, which suffer from either high tensor computation requirements or low accuracy, the proposed ODW-assisted models can perform indoor localization in a near-real time fashion with high accuracy. Performances of the proposed ODW-assisted models are evaluated based on a real Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) dataset. The results illustrate potentials of the proposed ODW-assisted techniques in achieving high classification accuracy with significantly reduced computational time, making them applicable for near real-time implementations.",0
"This research proposal presents a novel approach to indoor localization using two-stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) frameworks assisted by Online Dynamic Windows (ODW). The proposed method addresses several limitations of existing approaches including high computational requirements, low accuracy, and lack of robustness in dynamic environments.  The first stage of the proposed framework uses LSTM networks to learn spatial features from sensory data such as WiFi signals, Bluetooth signals, and cellular tower signals. These features are then used to predict potential locations within a predefined range of interest. In the second stage, ODW is employed to update the weights of the network dynamically based on new sensor readings received during runtime, ensuring that the system adapts quickly to changes in the environment.  Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 94% precision and recall on real-world datasets. Additionally, the proposed method requires significantly less computing power than previous approaches while maintaining comparable performance.  In summary, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LSTM and ODW techniques for accurate and reliable indoor localization in changing environments. The proposed method has significant implications for applications such as autonomous robots, healthcare monitoring systems, and smart home automation. Further work includes improving the scalability and expanding the dataset coverage of the proposed method.",1

To facilitate the automatic decomposition of hierarchical tasks, we propose the use of step-by-step human demonstrations in the form of natural language instructions and action trajectories. We introduce a dataset of such demonstrations in a crafting-based grid world. Our model consists of a high-level language generator and low-level policy, conditioned on language. We find that human demonstrations help solve the most complex tasks. We also find that incorporating natural language allows the model to generalize to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting and to learn quickly from a few demonstrations. Generalization is not only reflected in the actions of the agent, but also in the generated natural language instructions in unseen tasks. Our approach also gives our trained agent interpretable behaviors because it is able to generate a sequence of high-level descriptions of its actions.",0
"Increasing generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) is a significant challenge as agents must learn from limited experience, adapt to new tasks quickly, and transfer knowledge across diverse domains. Traditionally, RL relies heavily on trial-and-error interactions between agents and environments, which often leads to suboptimal performance due to insufficient data or unreliable feedback signals. However, recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of using human instructions or demonstrations to improve agent learning efficiency and performance by providing explicit guidance that accelerates exploration, directs attention to essential aspects, and fine-tunes behavior policies. This paper presents Ask Your Humans, an approach that leverages human knowledge during policy optimization, enabling agents to achieve better generalization abilities through interactive experiences under real-world constraints. By integrating natural language processing techniques, we enable flexible and informative communication channels where humans can express their desired outcomes and guide agents' decisions more effectively. Our extensive evaluation shows significant improvements over strong baselines, confirming the benefits of incorporating human inputs into the model training process, particularly in complex scenarios with high uncertainty or ambiguity. Overall, Ask Your Humans offers promising potential as a practical tool for improving RL solutions and reducing reliance on large datasets or elaborate reward engineering processes, laying the foundation for future research at the intersection of RL and HCI.",1
"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful in the tasks oriented to sequential data, such as natural language processing and video recognition. However, since the modern RNNs, including long-short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, have complex topologies and expensive space/computation complexity, compressing them becomes a hot and promising topic in recent years. Among plenty of compression methods, tensor decomposition, e.g., tensor train (TT), block term (BT), tensor ring (TR) and hierarchical Tucker (HT), appears to be the most amazing approach since a very high compression ratio might be obtained. Nevertheless, none of these tensor decomposition formats can provide both the space and computation efficiency. In this paper, we consider to compress RNNs based on a novel Kronecker CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (KCP) decomposition, which is derived from Kronecker tensor (KT) decomposition, by proposing two fast algorithms of multiplication between the input and the tensor-decomposed weight. According to our experiments based on UCF11, Youtube Celebrities Face and UCF50 datasets, it can be verified that the proposed KCP-RNNs have comparable performance of accuracy with those in other tensor-decomposed formats, and even 278,219x compression ratio could be obtained by the low rank KCP. More importantly, KCP-RNNs are efficient in both space and computation complexity compared with other tensor-decomposed ones under similar ranks. Besides, we find KCP has the best potential for parallel computing to accelerate the calculations in neural networks.",0
"Title: ""Kronecker CP Decomposition for Efficient Implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks""  Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have emerged as powerful models for processing sequential data such as natural language text or speech signals. However, their efficiency can suffer due to high computational complexity and memory requirements. In particular, matrix multiplications involving large weight matrices slow down training and inference.  To address these issues, we propose using the Kronecker Canonical Polyadic decomposition (CPD) to factorize the weight matrices involved in RNN computations into smaller, more efficient ones. This allows us to perform matrix multiplications using faster Fourier Transform methods that exploit sparsity and locality patterns present in the decomposed factors. Our approach extends previous work on linear regression and convolutional neural networks to recurrent models. We show through experiments on benchmark datasets that our proposed method significantly reduces both computation time and memory usage without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, by analyzing the properties of the resulting decompositions, we gain insights into the structure and redundancy inherent in RNN architectures.  In summary, our technique offers an effective solution for accelerating RNN implementations while preserving their expressive power. These advances hold promise for broader application areas where resource-constrained environments demand highly efficient machine learning solutions.",1
"Visual question answering (VQA) has recently been introduced to remote sensing to make information extraction from overhead imagery more accessible to everyone. VQA considers a question (in natural language, therefore easy to formulate) about an image and aims at providing an answer through a model based on computer vision and natural language processing methods. As such, a VQA model needs to jointly consider visual and textual features, which is frequently done through a fusion step. In this work, we study three different fusion methodologies in the context of VQA for remote sensing and analyse the gains in accuracy with respect to the model complexity. Our findings indicate that more complex fusion mechanisms yield an improved performance, yet that seeking a trade-of between model complexity and performance is worthwhile in practice.",0
"In this paper, we discuss how to create an effective image-text embedding model for use in remote sensing visual question answering systems. We begin by reviewing previous work in the field and identifying key challenges that must be overcome in order to achieve high performance. We then propose a novel methodology based on fine-grained attention mechanisms and adversarial training which significantly improves upon existing approaches. Our approach first extracts features from both images and questions using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), respectively. Next, these features are fused together using an attention mechanism designed specifically for multi-modal data fusion. Finally, our model is trained using adversarial training techniques inspired by generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures which further improve its ability to accurately predict answers to natural language queries about remotely sensed imagery. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Pre-Trained Vision-Language Models (VL-PTMs) have shown promising capabilities in grounding natural language in image data, facilitating a broad variety of cross-modal tasks. However, we note that there exists a significant gap between the objective forms of model pre-training and fine-tuning, resulting in a need for quantities of labeled data to stimulate the visual grounding capability of VL-PTMs for downstream tasks. To address the challenge, we present Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (CPT, alternatively, Colorful Prompt Tuning), a novel paradigm for tuning VL-PTMs, which reformulates visual grounding into a fill-in-the-blank problem with color-based co-referential markers in image and text, maximally mitigating the gap. In this way, our prompt tuning approach enables strong few-shot and even zero-shot visual grounding capabilities of VL-PTMs. Comprehensive experimental results show that prompt tuned VL-PTMs outperform their fine-tuned counterparts by a large margin (e.g., 17.3% absolute accuracy improvement, and 73.8% relative standard deviation reduction on average with one shot in RefCOCO evaluation). All the data and code will be available to facilitate future research.",0
"In natural language processing, pre-trained models such as GPT have revolutionized how we approach text generation tasks. However, these models are typically trained on large amounts of text data only, without any visual input. Recently, pre-training techniques using both image and text inputs have been proposed in order to improve performance in vision-language problems like zero-shot prompted image description (CLIP) and automatic question answering (AskCLI). These methods aim at training models that can effectively process textual descriptions of images, but they still lack generalization and robustness across different domains. In our work, we introduce CPT - Colorful Prompt Tuning, a novel method for fine-tuning CLIP-like models by dynamically generating colorful caption candidates. Our key insight is that optimizing over multiple candidate captions allows us to generate more accurate descriptions than traditional single sentence optimization objectives. We evaluate our model through several benchmarks including COCO Caption Evaluation Challenge and Flickr8k Test Suite. Experiments show that our method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art on these datasets while keeping simplicity in prompt engineering. Moreover, our method has the potential to leverage diverse external knowledge sources beyond image and text supervision. This opens up new possibilities in prompt-based tuning for other applications such as few-shot learning and meta-learning for computer vision. Overall, we believe our approach paves the way for future research into developing even stronger multimodal models via richer self-supervised signal from carefully designed but automatically generated prompt ensembles.",1
"Generating fine-grained, realistic images from text has many applications in the visual and semantic realm. Considering that, we propose Bangla Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (AttnGAN) that allows intensified, multi-stage processing for high-resolution Bangla text-to-image generation. Our model can integrate the most specific details at different sub-regions of the image. We distinctively concentrate on the relevant words in the natural language description. This framework has achieved a better inception score on the CUB dataset. For the first time, a fine-grained image is generated from Bangla text using attentional GAN. Bangla has achieved 7th position among 100 most spoken languages. This inspires us to explicitly focus on this language, which will ensure the inevitable need of many people. Moreover, Bangla has a more complex syntactic structure and less natural language processing resource that validates our work more.",0
"Fine-grained image generation from text descriptions has been an active research area for many years now, but there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One such challenge is generating high-quality images from textual descriptions that contain fine-grained details. This paper proposes a new approach based on attentional generative adversarial networks (Attention GANs) which can generate more detailed and accurate images from Bangla text descriptions. Our proposed method uses attention mechanisms within the generator network to focus on relevant parts of the input description and produce corresponding features in the generated image. Additionally, we use multi-scale discriminators to ensure that the generated images have sufficient quality at different scales. We evaluate our approach by comparing its performance against state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority through quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Overall, our results show that our proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of fine-grained image generation from Bangla text descriptions, opening up possibilities for applications in fields like multimedia data retrieval, computer vision, and natural language processing.",1
"We investigate the incorporation of visual relationships into the task of supervised image caption generation by proposing a model that leverages detected objects and auto-generated visual relationships to describe images in natural language. To do so, we first generate a scene graph from raw image pixels by identifying individual objects and visual relationships between them. This scene graph then serves as input to our graph-to-text model, which generates the final caption. In contrast to previous approaches, our model thus explicitly models the detection of objects and visual relationships in the image. For our experiments we construct a new dataset from the intersection of Visual Genome and MS COCO, consisting of images with both a corresponding gold scene graph and human-authored caption. Our results show that our methods outperform existing state-of-the-art end-to-end models that generate image descriptions directly from raw input pixels when compared in terms of the BLEU and METEOR evaluation metrics.",0
"One possible abstract for the paper ""Scene Graph Generation for Better Image Captioning?"" could read as follows:  The task of image caption generation involves generating natural language descriptions of images. In order to generate accurate and detailed descriptions, it is important to have a good understanding of the relationships and connections within the scene depicted in the image. This paper proposes using a scene graph to represent these relationships and improve the performance of image captioning models.  A scene graph is a structured representation of the objects, attributes, and relationships present in an image. By using machine learning algorithms to automatically generate high quality scene graphs from raw input images, we can provide image captioning systems with valuable contextual information that they would otherwise lack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over baseline methods that do not use scene graphs. Our results show that the proposed method leads to more accurate and descriptive captions while remaining efficient enough for real-time applications.",1
"The longitudinal modeling of neuroanatomical changes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for studying the progression of the disease. To this end, we introduce TransforMesh, a spatio-temporal network based on transformers that models longitudinal shape changes on 3D anatomical meshes. While transformer and mesh networks have recently shown impressive performances in natural language processing and computer vision, their application to medical image analysis has been very limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines transformer and mesh networks. Our results show that TransforMesh can model shape trajectories better than other baseline architectures that do not capture temporal dependencies. Moreover, we also explore the capabilities of TransforMesh in detecting structural anomalies of the hippocampus in patients developing AD.",0
"Abstract:  In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning algorithms such as transformers to analyze medical images. In particular, there is a need for methods that can longitudinally model anatomical meshes (i.e., models that represent the shape and appearance of organs or tissues over time). However, existing transformer networks have limitations when applied to these types of meshes, including difficulties in handling missing data and capturing complex geometric relationships among neighboring vertices.  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called ""TransforMesh"" which combines traditional vertex representation with additional edge features and mesh normal vectors. This allows our network to capture more detailed geometric information from the mesh structure. We introduce new attention mechanisms specifically designed for working with meshes, allowing the network to focus on relevant parts of the mesh while minimizing distractions caused by missing data or other irrelevant regions. Our approach uses a shared convolutional decoder architecture across all layers for efficient computation, enabling us to generate high quality longitudinal meshes at inference time.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for generating high resolution 4D meshes with improved accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our framework achieves better temporal coherence in both the shape and texture of the 4D meshes. These findings indicate the potential of our method for applications such as patient specific modelling of cardiac motion, simulation of disease progression, and evaluation of treatment outcomes.",1
"Recent progress in the Natural Language Processing domain has given us several State-of-the-Art (SOTA) pretrained models which can be finetuned for specific tasks. These large models with billions of parameters trained on numerous GPUs/TPUs over weeks are leading in the benchmark leaderboards. In this paper, we discuss the need for a benchmark for cost and time effective smaller models trained on a single GPU. This will enable researchers with resource constraints experiment with novel and innovative ideas on tokenization, pretraining tasks, architecture, fine tuning methods etc. We set up Small-Bench NLP, a benchmark for small efficient neural language models trained on a single GPU. Small-Bench NLP benchmark comprises of eight NLP tasks on the publicly available GLUE datasets and a leaderboard to track the progress of the community. Our ELECTRA-DeBERTa (15M parameters) small model architecture achieves an average score of 81.53 which is comparable to that of BERT-Base's 82.20 (110M parameters). Our models, code and leaderboard are available at https://github.com/smallbenchnlp",0
"Small-bench NLP was created to provide a benchmark dataset for testing small language processing systems that run on individual PCs without costly parallel hardware such as clouds or clusters. Unlike other datasets used for training large language models like GPT or BERT which contain millions of tokens, this dataset only contains one million tokens. This makes it ideal for use by hobbyists or researchers who don't have access to massive amounts of compute power, allowing them to train smaller models quickly and easily. Additionally, this dataset includes a variety of tasks including sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc so users can compare their performance against existing state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, small-bench NLP provides a resource for those working on NLP without significant resources at their disposal, enabling them to work on cutting edge problems in NLP without needing to invest heavily in computing infrastructure.",1
"Given an untrimmed video and a natural language query, Natural Language Video Localization (NLVL) aims to identify the video moment described by the query. To address this task, existing methods can be roughly grouped into two groups: 1) propose-and-rank models first define a set of hand-designed moment candidates and then find out the best-matching one. 2) proposal-free models directly predict two temporal boundaries of the referential moment from frames. Currently, almost all the propose-and-rank methods have inferior performance than proposal-free counterparts. In this paper, we argue that propose-and-rank approach is underestimated due to the predefined manners: 1) Hand-designed rules are hard to guarantee the complete coverage of targeted segments. 2) Densely sampled candidate moments cause redundant computation and degrade the performance of ranking process. To this end, we propose a novel model termed LPNet (Learnable Proposal Network for NLVL) with a fixed set of learnable moment proposals. The position and length of these proposals are dynamically adjusted during training process. Moreover, a boundary-aware loss has been proposed to leverage frame-level information and further improve the performance. Extensive ablations on two challenging NLVL benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of LPNet over existing state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In this paper, we propose natural language video localization using learnable moment proposals (LMPs). LMPs are learned representations of regions of interest that can be used for tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and action recognition. We use these region proposals to generate natural language descriptions of objects and actions within a given video sequence. Our approach enables automatic text generation by combining bottom-up visual features and top-down cues from natural language queries. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of using learnable moment proposals for natural language video understanding.

"Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV), i.e., grounding a natural language sentence which indicates complex human activities in a long and untrimmed video sequence, has received unprecedented attentions over the last few years. Although each newly proposed method plausibly can achieve better performance than previous ones, current TSGV models still tend to capture the moment annotation biases and fail to take full advantage of multi-modal inputs. Even more incredibly, several extremely simple baselines without training can also achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we take a closer look at the existing evaluation protocols for TSGV, and find that both the prevailing dataset splits and evaluation metrics are the devils to cause unreliable benchmarking. To this end, we propose to re-organize two widely-used TSGV benchmarks (ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA). Specifically, we deliberately make the ground-truth moment distribution different in the training and test splits, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric dR@n,IoU@m to calibrate the basic IoU scores by penalizing on the bias-influenced moment predictions and alleviate the inflating evaluations caused by the dataset annotation biases such as overlong ground-truth moments. Under our new evaluation protocol, we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on eight state-of-the-art TSGV methods. All the results demonstrate that the re-organized dataset splits and new metric can better monitor the progress in TSGV. Our reorganized datsets are available at https://github.com/yytzsy/grounding_changing_distribution.",0
"This paper provides an overview of the problem of temporal sentence grounding in videos. We first define the task, discuss related work, and then present our dataset, which contains both temporally annotated video clips and manual annotations from human judges on how well each clip ""grounds"" a given natural language instruction. Finally, we introduce a new metric that takes into account different aspects of semantic similarity to evaluate the performance of models on this task. Our contributions are as follows: 1) construction of a large and diverse dataset suitable for training and evaluation; 2) introduction of an evaluation metric that accounts for multiple sources of variation in human annotation; 3) presentation of baseline model results using standard deep learning methods (such as end-to-end trained neural networks); 4) demonstration through ablation studies that our metric effectively measures key aspects of temporal sentence understanding by machines. Overall, we aim to stimulate research and development in improving machines ability to interact with complex visual environments such as those found in videos, especially in terms of their use of natural language commands to query these systems.",1
"3D visual grounding aims at grounding a natural language description about a 3D scene, usually represented in the form of 3D point clouds, to the targeted object region. Point clouds are sparse, noisy, and contain limited semantic information compared with 2D images. These inherent limitations make the 3D visual grounding problem more challenging. In this study, we propose 2D Semantics Assisted Training (SAT) that utilizes 2D image semantics in the training stage to ease point-cloud-language joint representation learning and assist 3D visual grounding. The main idea is to learn auxiliary alignments between rich, clean 2D object representations and the corresponding objects or mentioned entities in 3D scenes. SAT takes 2D object semantics, i.e., object label, image feature, and 2D geometric feature, as the extra input in training but does not require such inputs during inference. By effectively utilizing 2D semantics in training, our approach boosts the accuracy on the Nr3D dataset from 37.7% to 49.2%, which significantly surpasses the non-SAT baseline with the identical network architecture and inference input. Our approach outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple 3D visual grounding datasets, i.e., +10.4% absolute accuracy on Nr3D, +9.9% on Sr3D, and +5.6% on ScanRef.",0
"In this paper we propose SAT: 2D Semantics Assisted Training for 3D Visual Grounding, a novel approach that exploits the strong correlation existing between textual descriptions and object detection models. This correlation leads our method towards better localization and retrieval capabilities. Our method is trained on large amounts of data collected from image description datasets like COCO. The use of a pretrained model allows us to transfer knowledge across domains. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that by utilizing a combination of weakly supervised object detectors based on Faster R-CNNs and classifiers, we achieve significant improvements over current state-of-the-art methods in both 2D object detection and 3D visual grounding tasks. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach through a variety of ablation studies where we analyze performance under different experimental conditions. We conclude by discussing future research directions aimed at expanding the scope of our proposed approach to other applications such as natural language generation and human behavior understanding using computer vision techniques. Overall, this work presents a comprehensive solution for visual object recognition problems which can potentially lead to broader advancements in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.",1
"Transformers have seen an unprecedented rise in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision tasks. However, in audio tasks, they are either infeasible to train due to extremely large sequence length of audio waveforms or reach competitive performance after feature extraction through Fourier-based methods, incurring a loss-floor. In this work, we introduce an architecture, Audiomer, where we combine 1D Residual Networks with Performer Attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Keyword Spotting with raw audio waveforms, out-performing all previous methods while also being computationally cheaper, much more parameter and data-efficient. Audiomer allows for deployment in compute-constrained devices and training on smaller datasets.",0
"Audio keyword spotting refers to the task of detecting predefined keywords from audio recordings. This task has numerous applications such as speech recognition, video surveillance, and automated broadcast monitoring. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on this task due to their ability to capture complex patterns in audio data. In particular, transformer models have shown promising results by effectively capturing global dependencies in sequential data. However, designing efficient and accurate architectures for keyword spotting remains challenging due to factors such as varying keyword lengths, limited training data, and computational constraints. To address these issues, we introduce Audiomer, a novel convolutional transformer architecture designed specifically for keyword spotting. Our model utilizes both local and global attention mechanisms to improve performance while reducing computation requirements. We evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets and show that Audiomer outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics including precision, recall, and F1 score. Overall, Audiomer represents a significant advancement in the field of keyword spotting, paving the way for improved performance and wider adoption of this technology.",1
"Transformers, the default model of choices in natural language processing, have drawn scant attention from the medical imaging community. Given the ability to exploit long-term dependencies, transformers are promising to help atypical convolutional neural networks (convnets) to overcome its inherent shortcomings of spatial inductive bias. However, most of recently proposed transformer-based segmentation approaches simply treated transformers as assisted modules to help encode global context into convolutional representations without investigating how to optimally combine self-attention (i.e., the core of transformers) with convolution. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce nnFormer (i.e., Not-aNother transFormer), a powerful segmentation model with an interleaved architecture based on empirical combination of self-attention and convolution. In practice, nnFormer learns volumetric representations from 3D local volumes. Compared to the naive voxel-level self-attention implementation, such volume-based operations help to reduce the computational complexity by approximate 98% and 99.5% on Synapse and ACDC datasets, respectively. In comparison to prior-art network configurations, nnFormer achieves tremendous improvements over previous transformer-based methods on two commonly used datasets Synapse and ACDC. For instance, nnFormer outperforms Swin-UNet by over 7 percents on Synapse. Even when compared to nnUNet, currently the best performing fully-convolutional medical segmentation network, nnFormer still provides slightly better performance on Synapse and ACDC.",0
"This paper presents a novel architecture for volumetric segmentation called ""nnFormer"", which builds upon the successes of both transformers and fully convolutional networks (FCNs). While previous methods have achieved state-of-the-art results through combinations of encoders and decoders that leverage high-resolution feature maps, our method explores a new approach by interleaving these components to better capture contextual information across space and time. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design on two challenging datasets, showing significant improvements over existing methods. We believe that this work represents a step forward towards more efficient architectures for image segmentation tasks.",1
"Vision-language pre-training has recently emerged as a promising alternative for representation learning. It shifts from the tradition of using images and discrete labels for learning a fixed set of weights, seen as visual concepts, to aligning images and raw text for two separate encoders. Such a paradigm benefits from a broader source of supervision and allows zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks since visual concepts can be diametrically generated from natural language, known as prompt. In this paper, we identify that a major challenge of deploying such models in practice is prompt engineering. This is because designing a proper prompt, especially for context words surrounding a class name, requires domain expertise and typically takes a significant amount of time for words tuning since a slight change in wording could have a huge impact on performance. Moreover, different downstream tasks require specific designs, further hampering the efficiency of deployment. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach named context optimization (CoOp). The main idea is to model context in prompts using continuous representations and perform end-to-end learning from data while keeping the pre-trained parameters fixed. In this way, the design of task-relevant prompts can be fully automated. Experiments on 11 datasets show that CoOp effectively turns pre-trained vision-language models into data-efficient visual learners, requiring as few as one or two shots to beat hand-crafted prompts with a decent margin and able to gain significant improvements when using more shots (e.g., at 16 shots the average gain is around 17% with the highest reaching over 50%). CoOp also exhibits strong robustness to distribution shift.",0
"This paper presents a systematic investigation into learning effective text prompts for vision-language models. We find that current techniques for selecting image descriptions as prompts suffer from significant biases and limitations: often focusing on concrete object nouns over spatial relationships or actions, lacking diversity in language style or content, and struggling with referential ambiguity across objects, scenes, or even model versions. To address these issues, we propose two simple but highly impactful methods: (i)~Prompt Engineer\textemdash{}a data augmentation scheme that generates diverse, human-like and factually coherent alternatives given one seed description; (ii)~Model Manager\textemdash{}an ensemble method that learns which subsets of alternative prompts from both humans and Prompt Engineer better align with different subtasks across multiple datasets, reducing bias towards specific domains/labels or surface patterns.\looseness=-1 Our proposed approaches achieve state-of-the-art results on four challenging benchmark tasks without any additional training or fine-tuning of existing VLM architectures like CLIP\texttrademark{}.

"We introduce a new type of programming challenge called programming puzzles, as an objective and comprehensive evaluation of program synthesis, and release an open-source dataset of Python Programming Puzzles (P3). Each puzzle is defined by a short Python program $f$, and the goal is to find an input $x$ which makes $f$ output ""True"". The puzzles are objective in that each one is specified entirely by the source code of its verifier $f$, so evaluating $f(x)$ is all that is needed to test a candidate solution $x$. They do not require an answer key or input/output examples, nor do they depend on natural language understanding. The dataset is comprehensive in that it spans problems of a range of difficulties and domains, ranging from trivial string manipulation problems that are immediately obvious to human programmers (but not necessarily to AI), to classic programming puzzles (e.g., Towers of Hanoi), to interview/competitive-programming problems (e.g., dynamic programming), to longstanding open problems in algorithms and mathematics (e.g., factoring). The objective nature of P3 readily supports self-supervised bootstrapping. We develop baseline enumerative program synthesis and GPT-3 solvers that are capable of solving easy puzzles -- even without access to any reference solutions -- by learning from their own past solutions. Based on a small user study, we find puzzle difficulty to correlate between human programmers and the baseline AI solvers.",0
"Solving puzzles is more than just fun entertainment - they can also improve cognitive functioning and enhance problem solving skills. In recent years, programming puzzles have gained popularity as a tool for developers to sharpen their coding abilities and prepare them for real-world software engineering challenges. However, there remains limited research on the effectiveness of these puzzles in enhancing programming expertise. This study seeks to fill that gap by evaluating the impact of programming puzzles on novice programmers’ ability to solve problems effectively under pressure. Specifically, we designed two types of programming puzzles: one based on debugging code snippets and another involving generating algorithms. We then recruited participants at different levels of proficiency in Python programming language to take part in our experiment. Participants were randomly assigned into experimental groups where one group received training using traditional teaching methods while the other engaged with the programming puzzles. After an extensive pretest–posttest design, results indicate that programming puzzles significantly improved participants’ performance in terms of accuracy and speed when tackling real programming tasks compared to those who learned from conventional sources alone. These findings suggest that incorporating programming puzzles into computer science education curriculum could lead to significant improvements in students' coding proficiency.",1
"Patients associated with multiple co-occurring health conditions often face aggravated complications and less favorable outcomes. Co-occurring conditions are especially prevalent among individuals suffering from kidney disease, an increasingly widespread condition affecting 13% of the general population in the US. This study aims to identify and characterize patterns of co-occurring medical conditions in patients employing a probabilistic framework. Specifically, we apply topic modeling in a non-traditional way to find associations across SNOMEDCT codes assigned and recorded in the EHRs of13,000 patients diagnosed with kidney disease. Unlike most prior work on topic modeling, we apply the method to codes rather than to natural language. Moreover, we quantitatively evaluate the topics, assessing their tightness and distinctiveness, and also assess the medical validity of our results. Our experiments show that each topic is succinctly characterized by a few highly probable and unique disease codes, indicating that the topics are tight. Furthermore, inter-topic distance between each pair of topics is typically high, illustrating distinctiveness. Last, most coded conditions grouped together within a topic, are indeed reported to co-occur in the medical literature. Notably, our results uncover a few indirect associations among conditions that have hitherto not been reported as correlated in the medical literature.",0
"Medical records contain valuable information regarding patients’ comorbidities, but analyzing millions of clinical notes is challenging due to their unstructured nature. We propose using a generative probabilistic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract comorbidity patterns from millions of electronic health record narratives encoded using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). Our approach leverages knowledge extracted from patient encounters, lab orders, diagnosis codes and medications in each encounter note. Using these features, our model captures co-occurrences among different SNOMED CT concepts within local communities defined by individual patients, thus generating meaningful insights into disease clusters specific to patient populations such as cardiovascular risk factors, gastroenterology issues and metabolic disorders. By applying LDA over massive amounts of data and identifying shared topics across many patients, we aim to provide a novel method for exposing meaningful relationships among medical problems that can assist both providers and researchers in making better-informed decisions.

This study proposes a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based generative probabilistic model utilizing Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) to tackle these difficulties. Our framework mines data from multiple sources, including electronic health records (EHR), lab orders, diagnosis codes, and medication orders. Utilizing these diverse data points, our model discovers concurrency clusters for different SNOMED CT concepts at the level of individual patients, resulting in locally relevant insights into disease groupings. These discoveries range from cardiovascular risks t",1
"Statistical language modeling and translation with transformers have found many successful applications in program understanding and generation tasks, setting high benchmarks for tools in modern software development environments. The finite context window of these neural models means, however, that they will be unable to leverage the entire relevant context of large files and packages for any given task. While there are many efforts to extend the context window, we introduce an architecture-independent approach for leveraging the syntactic hierarchies of source code for incorporating entire file-level context into a fixed-length window. Using concrete syntax trees of each source file we extract syntactic hierarchies and integrate them into context window by selectively removing from view more specific, less relevant scopes for a given task. We evaluate this approach on code generation tasks and joint translation of natural language and source code in Python programming language, achieving a new state-of-the-art in code completion and summarization for Python in the CodeXGLUE benchmark. We also introduce new CodeXGLUE benchmarks for user-experience-motivated tasks: code completion with normalized literals, method body completion/code summarization conditioned on file-level context.",0
"This paper presents a new method for analyzing source code files called Long-Range Modelling Of Source Code Files With Ewash: Extended Window Access By Syntax Hierarchy (ewash). Ewash utilizes the concept of syntax hierarchy as a means of organizing data within a window so that large amounts of source code can be easily understood and maintained. Additionally, this tool allows users to define their own access rules, meaning that developers have complete control over how they structure their code base. By using extended windows, ewash makes it possible to analyze both local and non-local contexts at once, providing insight into the relationships between different parts of the code. Ultimately, ewash represents a significant step forward in software engineering and development and promises to make the process more efficient and effective than ever before.",1
"Large Transformer models have been central to recent advances in natural language processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention.   Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models and several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have resulted in significant improvements in natural language processing tasks such as text generation and translation. One key factor behind these successes has been the use of transformer architectures, which excel at capturing long-range dependencies by self attention mechanisms. However, training transformer models can often be computationally expensive and require vast amounts of data and computational resources. In this work, we aim to find more efficient alternatives to the standard transformer architecture that maintains their performance on downstream NLP tasks while reducing the need for large datasets and computing power. We investigate different methods such as data augmentation techniques, model pruning, quantization, and hybrid approaches to achieve this goal. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods, showing promising results for deploying transformer models in real-world settings where resource constraints may apply. This paper provides a comprehensive guide and discussion of current research trends in developing efficient transformer models for language modeling, highlighting opportunities for future work in this area.",1
"Temporal sentence grounding in videos(TSGV), which aims to localize one target segment from an untrimmed video with respect to a given sentence query, has drawn increasing attentions in the research community over the past few years. Different from the task of temporal action localization, TSGV is more flexible since it can locate complicated activities via natural languages, without restrictions from predefined action categories. Meanwhile, TSGV is more challenging since it requires both textual and visual understanding for semantic alignment between two modalities(i.e., text and video). In this survey, we give a comprehensive overview for TSGV, which i) summarizes the taxonomy of existing methods, ii) provides a detailed description of the evaluation protocols(i.e., datasets and metrics) to be used in TSGV, and iii) in-depth discusses potential problems of current benchmarking designs and research directions for further investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey on temporal sentence grounding. More specifically, we first discuss existing TSGV approaches by grouping them into four categories, i.e., two-stage methods, end-to-end methods, reinforcement learning-based methods, and weakly supervised methods. Then we present the benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics to assess current research progress. Finally, we discuss some limitations in TSGV through pointing out potential problems improperly resolved in the current evaluation protocols, which may push forwards more cutting edge research in TSGV. Besides, we also share our insights on several promising directions, including three typical tasks with new and practical settings based on TSGV.",0
"One of the key challenges in computer vision is understanding what happens over time in video sequences, and connecting language descriptions of events to the corresponding visual representations. This task is known as temporal sentence grounding in videos (TSG), which involves identifying relevant spans of video that correspond to natural language sentences describing past events. TSG has potential applications in areas such as video analysis, event detection, and human-machine interaction. However, there have been few comprehensive surveys on TSG despite growing interest in the field. In response, we provide a survey of TSG approaches across different modalities (e.g., text, images, audio) and domains (e.g., entertainment, sports). We evaluate current methods based on their effectiveness at generating accurate alignments between language statements and temporally localized segments from videos. Our aim is to encourage further research into the development of more advanced TSG techniques by highlighting promising directions and discussing open challenges in the field.",1
"Estimating the performance of a machine learning system is a longstanding challenge in artificial intelligence research. Today, this challenge is especially relevant given the emergence of systems which appear to increasingly outperform human beings. In some cases, this ""superhuman"" performance is readily demonstrated; for example by defeating legendary human players in traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance. Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human annotations. In reality, human annotators can make mistakes and be subjective. Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle may be more objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is expensive or impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is unobserved. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis provides a simple recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an oracle does not exist, and show that under our assumptions a number of models from recent years are with high probability superhuman.",0
"This research presents a new approach for evaluating the performance of classifiers that have been trained using advanced machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks. These ""superhuman"" classifiers can often outperform human experts on specific tasks, but their accuracy and reliability must still be verified before they can be trusted to make important decisions. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology for certifying the outputs of superhuman classifiers using human judgments. Our approach involves collecting feedback from human annotators on a subset of examples that were labeled by the classifier. We use this feedback to identify any errors made by the classifier and to adjust its parameters accordingly. By iteratively refining the classifier based on human input, our method ensures that it achieves high levels of accuracy while remaining interpretable and transparent. Overall, our work offers a promising solution for building reliable, trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that complement human expertise rather than replace it.",1
"EEG signals are usually simple to obtain but expensive to label. Although supervised learning has been widely used in the field of EEG signal analysis, its generalization performance is limited by the amount of annotated data. Self-supervised learning (SSL), as a popular learning paradigm in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), can employ unlabeled data to make up for the data shortage of supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method of EEG signals for sleep stage classification. During the training process, we set up a pretext task for the network in order to match the right transformation pairs generated from EEG signals. In this way, the network improves the representation ability by learning the general features of EEG signals. The robustness of the network also gets improved in dealing with diverse data, that is, extracting constant features from changing data. In detail, the network's performance depends on the choice of transformations and the amount of unlabeled data used in the training process of self-supervised learning. Empirical evaluations on the Sleep-edf dataset demonstrate the competitive performance of our method on sleep staging (88.16% accuracy and 81.96% F1 score) and verify the effectiveness of SSL strategy for EEG signal analysis in limited labeled data regimes. All codes are provided publicly online.",0
"Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the development of techniques that can automatically classify sleep stages using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. One such method, self-supervised contrastive learning (SSL), has shown promise in improving sleep stage classification accuracy without requiring large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we explore the use of SSL for EEG-based sleep staging by training neural network models on pairs of EEG waveforms that are randomly selected from within each epoch and each sleep stage. We evaluate our approach using two publicly available datasets and compare it against other commonly used methods for sleep stage classification. Our results show that SSL outperforms these baseline methods, achieving higher accuracies across all four sleep stages. These findings suggest that SSL may provide a valuable tool for researchers studying sleep disorders and could potentially lead to more accurate diagnoses and better treatment options for patients.",1
"Chest radiographs are one of the most common diagnostic modalities in clinical routine. It can be done cheaply, requires minimal equipment, and the image can be diagnosed by every radiologists. However, the number of chest radiographs obtained on a daily basis can easily overwhelm the available clinical capacities. We propose RATCHET: RAdiological Text Captioning for Human Examined Thoraces. RATCHET is a CNN-RNN-based medical transformer that is trained end-to-end. It is capable of extracting image features from chest radiographs, and generates medically accurate text reports that fit seamlessly into clinical work flows. The model is evaluated for its natural language generation ability using common metrics from NLP literature, as well as its medically accuracy through a surrogate report classification task. The model is available for download at: http://www.github.com/farrell236/RATCHET.",0
"In this paper, we present RATCHET (Radiologist Assistant by Cascading Tables), a novel medical transformer architecture for chest X-ray diagnosis and reporting. Despite recent advances in image analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), manual report generation remains laborious and time consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce RATCHET as an end-to-end solution that integrates both image analysis and natural language processing components within a unified framework. Our approach leverages fine-grained attention mechanisms across cascaded table representations to capture interdependencies among multi-scale features and semantic concepts underlying radiological images. We train our model on a large dataset consisting of deidentified patient scans from multiple hospitals. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over prior art on key metrics relevant to clinical practice such as perceptual quality scores, detection sensitivity and accuracy, and automation efficiency. Our findings suggest potential benefits of deploying RATCHET as a decision support tool in routine diagnostic workflows to reduce turnaround times and enhance quality of care without sacrificing human expertise. Overall, this work represents an initial step towards realizing artificial intelligence applications beyond simple classification tasks in healthcare settings while mitigating concerns regarding explainability, interpretability, ethics, privacy, security, safety, robustness, generalization, and fairness. Future directions may involve expanding the scope of RATCHET’s capabilities along different dimensions such as disease specificity, task customizability, context adaptivity, explainability, transparency, scalability, portability, reproducibility, maintainability, and sustainability. Ultimately, continued progress necessitates active collaboration involving stakeholders spanning diverse disciplines including radiology experts, software engineers, data scientists, bioethicists, policymakers, legal scholars, cybersecurity researchers, social impact analysts, educators, funding agencies, patien",1
"Adversarial regularization has been shown to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models in various natural language processing tasks. Existing works usually formulate the method as a zero-sum game, which is solved by alternating gradient descent/ascent algorithms. Such a formulation treats the adversarial and the defending players equally, which is undesirable because only the defending player contributes to the generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose Stackelberg Adversarial Regularization (SALT), which formulates adversarial regularization as a Stackelberg game. This formulation induces a competition between a leader and a follower, where the follower generates perturbations, and the leader trains the model subject to the perturbations. Different from conventional approaches, in SALT, the leader is in an advantageous position. When the leader moves, it recognizes the strategy of the follower and takes the anticipated follower's outcomes into consideration. Such a leader's advantage enables us to improve the model fitting to the unperturbed data. The leader's strategic information is captured by the Stackelberg gradient, which is obtained using an unrolling algorithm. Our experimental results on a set of machine translation and natural language understanding tasks show that SALT outperforms existing adversarial regularization baselines across all tasks. Our code is publicly available.",0
"Advances in machine learning have led to significant improvements in tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and computer vision. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause them to make incorrect predictions by adding carefully crafted perturbations to input data. To address this problem, researchers have proposed adversarial regularization methods that aim to increase model robustness against such attacks. In this paper, we present an unrolling optimization approach that reformulates adversarial regularization as a two-player game inspired by the Stackelberg competition framework. This allows us to design efficient algorithms that incorporate both minimax objectives and standard regularizers into a single end-to-end trainable system. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the robustness of deep neural networks on several benchmark datasets while maintaining their accuracy on clean inputs. Overall, our work provides a new perspective on adversarial regularization and offers promising results towards enhancing the security of artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Change captioning tasks aim to detect changes in image pairs observed before and after a scene change and generate a natural language description of the changes. Existing change captioning studies have mainly focused on a single change.However, detecting and describing multiple changed parts in image pairs is essential for enhancing adaptability to complex scenarios. We solve the above issues from three aspects: (i) We propose a simulation-based multi-change captioning dataset; (ii) We benchmark existing state-of-the-art methods of single change captioning on multi-change captioning; (iii) We further propose Multi-Change Captioning transformers (MCCFormers) that identify change regions by densely correlating different regions in image pairs and dynamically determines the related change regions with words in sentences. The proposed method obtained the highest scores on four conventional change captioning evaluation metrics for multi-change captioning. Additionally, our proposed method can separate attention maps for each change and performs well with respect to change localization. Moreover, the proposed framework outperformed the previous state-of-the-art methods on an existing change captioning benchmark, CLEVR-Change, by a large margin (+6.1 on BLEU-4 and +9.7 on CIDEr scores), indicating its general ability in change captioning tasks.",0

Furthermore, we show that our approach leads to improved understanding of specific change operations compared to prior work. These findings suggest promising applications for natural language processing tasks such as text editing and machine translation.",1
"Due to the advances in computing and sensing, deep learning (DL) has widely been applied in smart energy systems (SESs). These DL-based solutions have proved their potentials in improving the effectiveness and adaptiveness of the control systems. However, in recent years, increasing evidence shows that DL techniques can be manipulated by adversarial attacks with carefully-crafted perturbations. Adversarial attacks have been studied in computer vision and natural language processing. However, there is very limited work focusing on the adversarial attack deployment and mitigation in energy systems. In this regard, to better prepare the SESs against potential adversarial attacks, we propose an innovative adversarial attack model that can practically compromise dynamical controls of energy system. We also optimize the deployment of the proposed adversarial attack model by employing deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. In this paper, we present our first-stage work in this direction. In simulation section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed adversarial attack model using standard IEEE 9-bus system.",0
"The proposed attack targets the contingency detection mechanism which plays a crucial role in maintaining stability in smart energy systems. The adversary crafts a carefully designed power supply schedule that subtly modifies grid operations while appearing innocuous to current techniques used in detecting contingencies. Our findings highlight serious limitations in existing approaches towards contingency analysis, calling for advancements in methods able to effectively mitigate potential security threats posed by intelligent attacks on smart grids. ---  An attack against the contingency detection mechanisms in smart energy systems can pose significant risks to their overall stability and reliability. Current techniques employed to identify such vulnerabilities may prove insufficient in preventing these types of malicious actions. In our study, we demonstrate how adversaries can manipulate power distribution schedules in ways that go undetected, potentially causing harmful consequences for the grid’s integrity if left unchecked. Through rigorous testing and evaluation, we showcase how certain shortcomings in conventional contingency assessment strategies make them susceptible to manipulation, ultimately emphasizing the need for more advanced protection measures capable of safeguarding smart grids from intelligent threats. By shedding light on the potential dangers posed by contingency attacks, our research serves as a call for further improvements in securing critical infrastructure amidst the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity.",1
"Motivated by the success of masked language modeling~(MLM) in pre-training natural language processing models, we propose w2v-BERT that explores MLM for self-supervised speech representation learning. w2v-BERT is a framework that combines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to discretize input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative speech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualized speech representations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretized tokens. In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such as HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process, or vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can be optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised tasks~(the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously. Our experiments show that w2v-BERT achieves competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art pre-trained models on the LibriSpeech benchmarks when using the Libri-Light~60k corpus as the unsupervised data. In particular, when compared to published models such as conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 and HuBERT, our model shows~5\% to~10\% relative WER reduction on the test-clean and test-other subsets. When applied to the Google's Voice Search traffic dataset, w2v-BERT outperforms our internal conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 by more than~30\% relatively.",0
"Title should be ""Self-supervised speech pre-training"" Abstract for paper on self-supervised speech pre-training  With the advent of deep learning, there has been significant progress in the field of natural language processing (NLP) using large amounts of data and supervised training techniques. However, obtaining high-quality annotated data can be expensive and time consuming, making NLP challenges difficult to scale across different languages and domains. As such, there has been increasing interest in unsupervised and semi-supervised methods that can learn representations from large datasets without explicit annotations. In recent years, one popular method used for natural language representation learning is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which uses a masked language model objective to predict missing tokens given surrounding context. Here we explore using BERT as a starting point for pre-trained models on spoken language, leveraging contrastive objectives that encourage alignment between phonetic codes and their corresponding textual transcriptions. We describe our approach as wav2bert, where we train a model that maps raw audio inputs into continuous space representations amenable to fine-grained downstream tasks. Our evaluation shows promising results outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmarks including TIMIT, IMDb, and Google Speech Commands.",1
"Video grounding aims to localize the temporal segment corresponding to a sentence query from an untrimmed video. Almost all existing video grounding methods fall into two frameworks: 1) Top-down model: It predefines a set of segment candidates and then conducts segment classification and regression. 2) Bottom-up model: It directly predicts frame-wise probabilities of the referential segment boundaries. However, all these methods are not end-to-end, \ie, they always rely on some time-consuming post-processing steps to refine predictions. To this end, we reformulate video grounding as a set prediction task and propose a novel end-to-end multi-modal Transformer model, dubbed as \textbf{GTR}. Specifically, GTR has two encoders for video and language encoding, and a cross-modal decoder for grounding prediction. To facilitate the end-to-end training, we use a Cubic Embedding layer to transform the raw videos into a set of visual tokens. To better fuse these two modalities in the decoder, we design a new Multi-head Cross-Modal Attention. The whole GTR is optimized via a Many-to-One matching loss. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive studies to investigate different model design choices. Extensive results on three benchmarks have validated the superiority of GTR. All three typical GTR variants achieve record-breaking performance on all datasets and metrics, with several times faster inference speed.",0
"Recent advances have introduced multi-modal transformer architectures which fuse audio and visual features to obtain robust video representations. This has led to significant improvements on natural language grounding tasks where textual descriptions can refer to objects within videos. In our work, we investigate the effectiveness of using pretrained models that incorporate temporal modality as well, given their successes on other video tasks such as activity recognition, action detection and image generation. We apply recent techniques from contrastive learning by formulating a surrogate task based on human annotated object bounding boxes and compare multiple designs across different model sizes, pretraining strategies and fine-tuning regimes. Our extensive experiments reveal intricate design tradeoffs involved in achieving state-of-the-art performance on this challenging benchmark dataset that contains diverse scenarios spanning complex interactions among humans and objects. By probing into the attention mechanisms driving these results, we provide novel insights into how temporal reasoning impacts the choice of referring expressions when grounded against video data compared to simpler alternatives. These findings present opportunities for future research addressing remaining challenges involving scale variability and semantic ambiguity, paving ways towards more intelligent systems capable of understanding real world scenes in greater detail.",1
"Term weighting schemes are widely used in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. In particular, term weighting is the basis for keyword extraction. However, there are relatively few evaluation studies that shed light about the strengths and shortcomings of each weighting scheme. In fact, in most cases researchers and practitioners resort to the well-known tf-idf as default, despite the existence of other suitable alternatives, including graph-based models. In this paper, we perform an exhaustive and large-scale empirical comparison of both statistical and graph-based term weighting methods in the context of keyword extraction. Our analysis reveals some interesting findings such as the advantages of the less-known lexical specificity with respect to tf-idf, or the qualitative differences between statistical and graph-based methods.

By comparing these two approaches using several well-known datasets and evaluation metrics, we aim to provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses, and identify potential areas for improvement.

"A key problem in multi-task learning (MTL) research is how to select high-quality auxiliary tasks automatically. This paper presents GradTS, an automatic auxiliary task selection method based on gradient calculation in Transformer-based models. Compared to AUTOSEM, a strong baseline method, GradTS improves the performance of MT-DNN with a bert-base-cased backend model, from 0.33% to 17.93% on 8 natural language understanding (NLU) tasks in the GLUE benchmarks. GradTS is also time-saving since (1) its gradient calculations are based on single-task experiments and (2) the gradients are re-used without additional experiments when the candidate task set changes. On the 8 GLUE classification tasks, for example, GradTS costs on average 21.32% less time than AUTOSEM with comparable GPU consumption. Further, we show the robustness of GradTS across various task settings and model selections, e.g. mixed objectives among candidate tasks. The efficiency and efficacy of GradTS in these case studies illustrate its general applicability in MTL research without requiring manual task filtering or costly parameter tuning.",0

"The cross entropy loss is widely used due to its effectiveness and solid theoretical grounding. However, as training progresses, the loss tends to focus on hard to classify samples, which may prevent the network from obtaining gains in performance. While most work in the field suggest ways to classify hard negatives, we suggest to strategically leave hard negatives behind, in order to focus on misclassified samples with higher probabilities. We show that adding to the optimization goal the expectation loss, which is a better approximation of the zero-one loss, helps the network to achieve better accuracy. We, therefore, propose to shift between the two losses during training, focusing more on the expectation loss gradually during the later stages of training. Our experiments show that the new training protocol improves performance across a diverse set of classification domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, tabular data, and sequences. Our code and scripts are available at supplementary.",0

"The progress of some AI paradigms such as deep learning is said to be linked to an exponential growth in the number of parameters. There are many studies corroborating these trends, but does this translate into an exponential increase in energy consumption? In order to answer this question we focus on inference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of the computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we study relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated. The only caveat is, yet again, the multiplicative factor, as future AI increases penetration and becomes more pervasive.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have led to increased computational requirements and power consumption during inference tasks.

"Internet search affects people's cognition of the world, so mitigating biases in search results and learning fair models is imperative for social good. We study a unique gender bias in image search in this work: the search images are often gender-imbalanced for gender-neutral natural language queries. We diagnose two typical image search models, the specialized model trained on in-domain datasets and the generalized representation model pre-trained on massive image and text data across the internet. Both models suffer from severe gender bias. Therefore, we introduce two novel debiasing approaches: an in-processing fair sampling method to address the gender imbalance issue for training models, and a post-processing feature clipping method base on mutual information to debias multimodal representations of pre-trained models. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks show that our methods significantly reduce the gender bias in image search models.",0

"The research community has proposed copious modifications to the Transformer architecture since it was introduced over three years ago, relatively few of which have seen widespread adoption. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate many of these modifications in a shared experimental setting that covers most of the common uses of the Transformer in natural language processing. Surprisingly, we find that most modifications do not meaningfully improve performance. Furthermore, most of the Transformer variants we found beneficial were either developed in the same codebase that we used or are relatively minor changes. We conjecture that performance improvements may strongly depend on implementation details and correspondingly make some recommendations for improving the generality of experimental results.",0

"This paper proposes Panoptic Narrative Grounding, a spatially fine and general formulation of the natural language visual grounding problem. We establish an experimental framework for the study of this new task, including new ground truth and metrics, and we propose a strong baseline method to serve as stepping stone for future work. We exploit the intrinsic semantic richness in an image by including panoptic categories, and we approach visual grounding at a fine-grained level by using segmentations. In terms of ground truth, we propose an algorithm to automatically transfer Localized Narratives annotations to specific regions in the panoptic segmentations of the MS COCO dataset. To guarantee the quality of our annotations, we take advantage of the semantic structure contained in WordNet to exclusively incorporate noun phrases that are grounded to a meaningfully related panoptic segmentation region. The proposed baseline achieves a performance of 55.4 absolute Average Recall points. This result is a suitable foundation to push the envelope further in the development of methods for Panoptic Narrative Grounding.",0
"In the age of social media, instant gratification and constant connectivity has led to a shift in how we consume and create content online. With the rise of influencers and microcelebrities on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, we see a new type of narrative emerging that combines traditional storytelling techniques with interactive elements that allow audiences to participate directly in the creation process. This new form of “panoptic” storytelling presents both opportunities and challenges for creators seeking to engage their audience and maintain control over their own narratives. In this paper, we explore how panoptic narrative grounding can provide a framework for understanding and analyzing this emergent phenomenon, as well as offer insights into effective strategies for creating meaningful experiences within these complex systems. Using case studies from successful panoptic stories such as Mr Beast’s #ArgleBargleChallenge and Cody Ko’s Mini Challenge series, we demonstrate how combining principles of gamification, co-creation, and audience agency can lead to powerful and memorable moments of shared experience. By examining key features of these projects and considering future developments, our research contributes to discussions surrounding user participation in digital media and offers practical guidance for those looking to navigate this exciting but uncertain terrain. Overall, we believe that by investigating the mechanisms of interaction in contemporary online culture through lenses such as performance, spectacle, intimacy and risk taking, innovative approaches can be identified which capitalize upon the unique qualities afforded by these new forms of expression while mitigating potential risks associated with unchecked influence and manipulation. This inquiry should serve the interests of academics, professionals and members o",1
"Temporal grounding aims to temporally localize a video moment in the video whose semantics are related to a given natural language query. Existing methods typically apply a detection or regression pipeline on the fused representation with a focus on designing complicated heads and fusion strategies. Instead, from a perspective on temporal grounding as a metric-learning problem, we present a Dual Matching Network (DMN), to directly model the relations between language queries and video moments in a joint embedding space. This new metric-learning framework enables fully exploiting negative samples from two new aspects: constructing negative cross-modal pairs from a dual matching scheme and mining negative pairs across different videos. These new negative samples could enhance the joint representation learning of two modalities via cross-modal pair discrimination to maximize their mutual information. Experiments show that DMN achieves highly competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on four video grounding benchmarks. Based on DMN, we present a winner solution for STVG challenge of the 3rd PIC workshop. This suggests that metric-learning is still a promising method for temporal grounding via capturing the essential cross-modal correlation in a joint embedding space.",0
"Effective metric learning has been shown to be crucial for many computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Recent advancements have focused on developing algorithms that can learn metrics directly from data without relying on handcrafted features. However, most existing approaches only use positive samples (i.e., matching pairs) during training, which may lead to suboptimal solutions due to the lack of negative sample guidance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Negative Sample Matters (NSM) that incorporates both positive and negative samples into the metric learning process. Our method first generates a set of hard negative samples by clustering similarities obtained from kNN search. Then, we introduce a modality network that learns two modalities from both positive and negative examples to enhance their discriminative power. Finally, we jointly optimize the modality network and the distance function using alternating optimization. Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across three temporal grounding benchmarks under both metric evaluation and full model testing settings. This study demonstrates the importance of negative sample guidance in effective metric learning for temporal grounding.",1
"Narrated instructional videos often show and describe manipulations of similar objects, e.g., repairing a particular model of a car or laptop. In this work we aim to reconstruct such objects and to localize associated narrations in 3D. Contrary to the standard scenario of instance-level 3D reconstruction, where identical objects or scenes are present in all views, objects in different instructional videos may have large appearance variations given varying conditions and versions of the same product. Narrations may also have large variation in natural language expressions. We address these challenges by three contributions. First, we propose an approach for correspondence estimation combining learnt local features and dense flow. Second, we design a two-step divide and conquer reconstruction approach where the initial 3D reconstructions of individual videos are combined into a 3D alignment graph. Finally, we propose an unsupervised approach to ground natural language in obtained 3D reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the domain of car maintenance. Given raw instructional videos and no manual supervision, our method successfully reconstructs engines of different car models and associates textual descriptions with corresponding objects in 3D.",0
"This study focuses on reconstructing and grounding narrated instructional videos (NIVs) in 3D. NIVs have become increasingly popular as a means of conveying instructions through multimedia content. However, they often lack precise spatial information, making it difficult for viewers to follow along accurately. To address this issue, we propose a method that integrates language processing techniques with computer vision algorithms to create 3D reconstructions of scenes described in NIVs.  Our approach involves multiple stages, including natural language understanding, scene decomposition, 3D model generation, object detection and pose estimation, and image synthesis. First, our system extracts semantic information from NIV audio scripts using natural language understanding techniques such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. Then, we analyze each sentence and decompose the scene into objects and their corresponding poses. Next, we generate 3D models based on these descriptions, incorporating prior knowledge from online databases of real-world object shapes and sizes. Finally, we render images of the scene, complete with accurate lighting conditions and camera angles, providing a photorealistic representation of the reconstruction.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across several datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and consistency of 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, subjective evaluations confirm that our 3D representations significantly improve viewer comprehension of complex tasks demonstrated in NIVs. Overall, our work presents a significant step towards enhancing the accessibility and clarity of multimedia learning materials by combining advanced linguistics and computer vision techniques. By transforming NIVs into immersive, interactive, and informative experiences, learners can better engage with visualized content, fostering greater retention and application of learned material.",1
"Along with feature points for image matching, line features provide additional constraints to solve visual geometric problems in robotics and computer vision (CV). Although recent convolutional neural network (CNN)-based line descriptors are promising for viewpoint changes or dynamic environments, we claim that the CNN architecture has innate disadvantages to abstract variable line length into the fixed-dimensional descriptor. In this paper, we effectively introduce Line-Transformers dealing with variable lines. Inspired by natural language processing (NLP) tasks where sentences can be understood and abstracted well in neural nets, we view a line segment as a sentence that contains points (words). By attending to well-describable points on aline dynamically, our descriptor performs excellently on variable line length. We also propose line signature networks sharing the line's geometric attributes to neighborhoods. Performing as group descriptors, the networks enhance line descriptors by understanding lines' relative geometries. Finally, we present the proposed line descriptor and matching in a Point and Line Localization (PL-Loc). We show that the visual localization with feature points can be improved using our line features. We validate the proposed method for homography estimation and visual localization.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for visual localization using lines as contextual features in outdoor environments. Lines are ubiquitous in urban scenes and can provide valuable cues for place recognition by representing paths, edges, boundaries, and contours that characterize the environment. To leverage these visual clues, we introduce a line descriptor called ""LineNet"" which processes raw image patches containing lines into a fixed-length feature vector. Our proposed method extracts dense descriptors in images using a sliding window technique, followed by aggregation through multiple levels of convolutional neural networks (CNN). We show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of localization on real-world datasets while reducing computational complexity compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of LineNet in challenging scenarios such as poor lighting conditions and occlusions, demonstrating robustness under varying environmental conditions. Overall, LineNet provides a powerful tool for enabling contextually aware visual localization in complex outdoor settings.",1
"Deep learning models exhibit a preference for statistical fitting over logical reasoning. Spurious correlations might be memorized when there exists statistical bias in training data, which severely limits the model performance especially in small data scenarios. In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Adversarial Training framework (CAT) to tackle the problem from a causality perspective. Particularly, for a specific sample, CAT first generates a counterfactual representation through latent space interpolation in an adversarial manner, and then performs Counterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) on each original-counterfactual pair to adjust sample-wise loss weight dynamically, which encourages the model to explore the true causal effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAT achieves substantial performance improvement over SOTA across different downstream tasks, including sentence classification, natural language inference and question answering.",0
"This paper introduces counterfactually guided adversarial learning with representation interpolation (CGAI), which combines two complementary approaches: adversarial training and representation learning. By using both techniques together, we are able to improve performance on a variety of benchmark datasets while reducing computational cost. We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the art methods in several vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation and few shot learning. Our approach relies on a novel algorithm, called Causal Information Miner (CIM) that uses a contrastive objective function based on counterfactuals that allows us to guide the learning process towards better representations. Furthermore, CIM achieves state-of-the-art results by interpolating representations from different stages of the network, allowing better optimization of high level semantic features that are relevant for the task at hand. Overall, these findings highlight the benefits of combining adversarial training and representation learning for improved performance in computer vision.",1
"Video question answering (VideoQA) is challenging given its multimodal combination of visual understanding and natural language understanding. While existing approaches seldom leverage the appearance-motion information in the video at multiple temporal scales, the interaction between the question and the visual information for textual semantics extraction is frequently ignored. Targeting these issues, this paper proposes a novel Temporal Pyramid Transformer (TPT) model with multimodal interaction for VideoQA. The TPT model comprises two modules, namely Question-specific Transformer (QT) and Visual Inference (VI). Given the temporal pyramid constructed from a video, QT builds the question semantics from the coarse-to-fine multimodal co-occurrence between each word and the visual content. Under the guidance of such question-specific semantics, VI infers the visual clues from the local-to-global multi-level interactions between the question and the video. Within each module, we introduce a multimodal attention mechanism to aid the extraction of question-video interactions, with residual connections adopted for the information passing across different levels. Through extensive experiments on three VideoQA datasets, we demonstrate better performances of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-arts.",0
"The ability of computers to process and analyze video data has improved tremendously in recent years due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision techniques. One challenging task in video understanding is answering questions related to specific events occurring within a given video clip. To address this challenge, we present the use of a Temporal Pyramid Transformer (TPT), which can effectively capture temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in videos. Our approach incorporates multimodality by combining visual features extracted from RGB frames along with acoustic features obtained from audio streams to improve question answering accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of TPT for video question answering with multimodal interaction.",1
"Temporal grounding aims to predict a time interval of a video clip corresponding to a natural language query input. In this work, we present EVOQUER, a temporal grounding framework incorporating an existing text-to-video grounding model and a video-assisted query generation network. Given a query and an untrimmed video, the temporal grounding model predicts the target interval, and the predicted video clip is fed into a video translation task by generating a simplified version of the input query. EVOQUER forms closed-loop learning by incorporating loss functions from both temporal grounding and query generation serving as feedback. Our experiments on two widely used datasets, Charades-STA and ActivityNet, show that EVOQUER achieves promising improvements by 1.05 and 1.31 at R@0.7. We also discuss how the query generation task could facilitate error analysis by explaining temporal grounding model behavior.",0
"This sounds like a complex process! Can you please summarize how it works? For example, if I am working on a paper about quantum computing, would using a system such as yours cause me to come up with questions that relate directly back into the text of my paper (such as how quantum computing relates to cybersecurity), or would it generate more general ""filler"" type questions that may require additional research but don't have any direct relationship to the content of my work? In other words, can it essentially act like a kind of automatic study guide generator to ensure my mastery over a subject matter before turning in the final draft of a paper? Thanks! Let me know!",1
"Facial editing is an important task in vision and graphics with numerous applications. However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and fine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big laughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose Talk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs fine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the system. Our key insight is to model a continual ""semantic field"" in the GAN latent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing straight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated as finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape on the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and determined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To engage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback by considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic field.   We also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to facilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated fine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual descriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the smoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and 3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency. Notably, user study validates that our overall system is consistently favored by around 80% of the participants. Our project page is https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/talkedit/.",0
"Fine-grained facial editing allows users to make precise modifications to specific features of an image, such as changing the shape of someone's nose or eyes.

By using everyday language, our method makes it possible for anyone to adjust photos with ease, regardless of their technical background. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system by applying it to challenging scenarios involving hair restoration, aging simulation, and visual disorder correction. Our results show that Talk-to-Edit outperforms traditional photo editing tools on these tasks while significantly reducing user effort. Overall, this research contributes towards building intelligent systems capable of executing subtle tasks according to human instructions, paving the way for future applications in personalized digital content generation and even medical intervention planning.",1
"Machine learning has been utilized to perform tasks in many different domains such as classification, object detection, image segmentation and natural language analysis. Data labeling has always been one of the most important tasks in machine learning. However, labeling large amounts of data increases the monetary cost in machine learning. As a result, researchers started to focus on reducing data annotation and labeling costs. Transfer learning was designed and widely used as an efficient approach that can reasonably reduce the negative impact of limited data, which in turn, reduces the data preparation cost. Even transferring previous knowledge from a source domain reduces the amount of data needed in a target domain. However, large amounts of annotated data are still demanded to build robust models and improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Therefore, researchers started to pay more attention on auto annotation and labeling. In this survey paper, we provide a review of previous techniques that focuses on optimized data annotation and labeling for video, audio, and text data.",0

"Generating images according to natural language descriptions is a challenging task. Prior research has mainly focused to enhance the quality of generation by investigating the use of spatial attention and/or textual attention thereby neglecting the relationship between channels. In this work, we propose the Combined Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN) to generate photo-realistic images according to textual descriptions. The proposed CAGAN utilises two attention models: word attention to draw different sub-regions conditioned on related words; and squeeze-and-excitation attention to capture non-linear interaction among channels. With spectral normalisation to stabilise training, our proposed CAGAN improves the state of the art on the IS and FID on the CUB dataset and the FID on the more challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that judging a model by a single evaluation metric can be misleading by developing an additional model adding local self-attention which scores a higher IS, outperforming the state of the art on the CUB dataset, but generates unrealistic images through feature repetition.",0
"Abstract: This research presents a new approach to text-to-image generation using combined attention generative adversarial networks (GAN).

Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed technique. By combining attention mechanisms within GANs, we enable more efficient use of computational resources while generating higher quality images from written descriptions.",1
"In the last decade or so, we have witnessed deep learning reinvigorating the machine learning field. It has solved many problems in the domains of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and various other tasks with state-of-the-art performance. The data is generally represented in the Euclidean space in these domains. Various other domains conform to non-Euclidean space, for which graph is an ideal representation. Graphs are suitable for representing the dependencies and interrelationships between various entities. Traditionally, handcrafted features for graphs are incapable of providing the necessary inference for various tasks from this complex data representation.

"Abstract---Neural networks have been widely adopted as powerful tools for tackling complex problems in science and engineering. Since their introduction, researchers and practitioners alike have continually sought new ways to enhance their performance and expand their scope of application, leading to significant advances such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, traditional neural networks often face challenges related to their capacity, interpretability, stability, and scalability, especially when dealing with high-dimensional, large-scale, noisy, nonlinear, dynamic, uncertain, and incomplete data. This calls for innovative architectures that can better handle these types of issues while maintaining competitive accuracy levels.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent one promising direction due to their ability to capture graph structured representations from complex relationships among elements in a problem domain. GNNs extend traditional neural networks by incorporating both global and local patterns, handling irregular domains using topological properties, preserving node order and proximity relationships, and efficiently utilizing neighborhood information through message passing. As a result, they present numerous advantages over alternative approaches, including enhanced representational power and learning capacity, improved robustness against noise and missing data, superior explainability and transparency, more efficient use of computational resources, and greater flexibility in model architecture design and optimization.In this survey article, we provide a comprehensive review of the development and recent trends in GNNs research since 2017.

"Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in developing techniques that can effectively handle sequential data such as images, audio, and text.

We discuss the motivation behind applying these models to visual data and provide a detailed review of existing work on designing architectures that incorporate transformers into convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We then outline several approaches to pre-training and fine-tuning transformer architectures on image datasets and describe their performance across different benchmarks. Finally, we highlight some key challenges faced by researchers working in this area and suggest directions for future research. Overall, our aim is to provide a comprehensive resource for practitioners and researchers interested in exploring the potential of transformer networks for tackling problems related to computer vision.",1
"Deep neural networks for natural language processing are fragile in the face of adversarial examples -- small input perturbations, like synonym substitution or word duplication, which cause a neural network to change its prediction. We present an approach to certifying the robustness of LSTMs (and extensions of LSTMs) and training models that can be efficiently certified. Our approach can certify robustness to intractably large perturbation spaces defined programmatically in a language of string transformations. Our evaluation shows that (1) our approach can train models that are more robust to combinations of string transformations than those produced using existing techniques; (2) our approach can show high certification accuracy of the resulting models.",0
"Despite being powerful tools for modeling sequential data, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks have been known to fail when confronted with inputs that differ from their training set in ways they were never explicitly exposed to during training time. We propose here two novel regularization techniques aiming at making these models more robust to such perturbations by learning representations which are insensitive to specific classes thereof. In the first part we introduce our contributions in the scope of text generation: We design a new type of noise which can be added to both input sequences as well as internal states during training without harming quality. By doing so we simultaneously increase robustness wrt common corruptions like misspellings or removed tokens while obtaining better sample quality. Finally, we also apply the above mentioned technique on top of state of the art language models trained either using Reinforcement Learning from human feedback or self supervisedlearning objectives such as MLM or denoising autoencoders . Secondly we focus on improving few shot prompting efficiency through knowledge distillation. For this purpose we freeze most parameters of all layers within some intermediate downstream block close to the beginning of the model but fine tune only those responsible for producing the output logits associated with class probabilities. Surprisingly enough even though the student knows nothing about the task to solve prior to adaptation, it still manages to outperform state of the art zero shot baselines as soon as just 4 examples per class become available . As expected the method works less effectively when noisy augmentation is not applied during teacher and/orstudent finetuning and fails completely when we remove it altogether framing results in previous paragraph within an appropriate setting given some random initialization.",1
"More transformer blocks with residual connections have recently achieved impressive results on various tasks. To achieve better performance with fewer trainable parameters, recent methods are proposed to go shallower by parameter sharing or model compressing along with the depth. However, weak modeling capacity limits their performance. Contrastively, going wider by inducing more trainable matrixes and parameters would produce a huge model requiring advanced parallelism to train and inference.   In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient framework, going wider instead of deeper. Specially, following existing works, we adapt parameter sharing to compress along depth. But, such deployment would limit the performance. To maximize modeling capacity, we scale along model width by replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with mixture-of-experts (MoE). Across transformer blocks, instead of sharing normalization layers, we propose to use individual layernorms to transform various semantic representations in a more parameter-efficient way. To evaluate our plug-and-run framework, we design WideNet and conduct comprehensive experiments on popular computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, our best model outperforms Vision Transformer (ViT) by $1.5\%$ with $0.72 \times$ trainable parameters. Using $0.46 \times$ and $0.13 \times$ parameters, our WideNet can still surpass ViT and ViT-MoE by $0.8\%$ and $2.1\%$, respectively. On four natural language processing datasets, WideNet outperforms ALBERT by $1.8\%$ on average and surpass BERT using factorized embedding parameterization by $0.8\%$ with fewer parameters.",0
"When writing a scientific research article, one common piece of advice that is often given to authors is “go wider instead of deeper.” While this may sound counterintuitive at first glance, there are actually several good reasons why adopting this approach can be beneficial both for your own productivity as well as for the impact of your work on the field. In many cases, trying to cover too much ground too quickly can lead to superficiality rather than real depth; by taking a more focused view of specific topics and their implications, you’ll find yourself able to engage with them more effectively and ultimately produce better quality work overall. Overall, while going narrowly into particular problems can seem like a limiting strategy, doing so thoughtfully – understanding the connections between problems and how they relate to broader trends within the field – can end up paying significant dividends over time. If these ideas resonate with you and you’d like to explore further how this might apply in your case specifically feel free to reach out. I’m always happy to chat!",1
"Crop and weed monitoring is an important challenge for agriculture and food production nowadays. Thanks to recent advances in data acquisition and computation technologies, agriculture is evolving to a more smart and precision farming to meet with the high yield and high quality crop production. Classification and recognition in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) images are important phases for crop monitoring. Advances in deep learning models relying on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have achieved high performances in image classification in the agricultural domain. Despite the success of this architecture, CNN still faces many challenges such as high computation cost, the need of large labelled datasets, ... Natural language processing's transformer architecture can be an alternative approach to deal with CNN's limitations. Making use of the self-attention paradigm, Vision Transformer (ViT) models can achieve competitive or better results without applying any convolution operations. In this paper, we adopt the self-attention mechanism via the ViT models for plant classification of weeds and crops: red beet, off-type beet (green leaves), parsley and spinach. Our experiments show that with small set of labelled training data, ViT models perform better compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based models EfficientNet and ResNet, with a top accuracy of 99.8\% achieved by the ViT model.",0
"Agricultural crop monitoring using high resolution UAV images has become increasingly important as it allows farmers to easily identify weed growth, plant health issues, nutrient deficiencies, and other key factors that affect yield.

"Currently nearing human-level performance, Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an emerging area in artificial intelligence.   Established as a multi-disciplinary field in machine learning, both computer vision and natural language processing communities are working together to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.   However, there is a gap between the SOTA results and real world applications.   This is due to the lack of model generalisation.   The RAMEN model \cite{Shrestha2019} aimed to achieve domain generalization by obtaining the highest score across two main types of VQA datasets.   This study provides two major improvements to the early/late fusion module and aggregation module of the RAMEN architecture, with the objective of further strengthening domain generalization.   Vector operations based fusion strategies are introduced for the fusion module and the transformer architecture is introduced for the aggregation module.   Improvements of up to five VQA datasets from the experiments conducted are evident.   Following the results, this study analyses the effects of both the improvements on the domain generalization problem.

"Learning from image-text data has demonstrated recent success for many recognition tasks, yet is currently limited to visual features or individual visual concepts such as objects. In this paper, we propose one of the first methods that learn from image-sentence pairs to extract a graphical representation of localized objects and their relationships within an image, known as scene graph. To bridge the gap between images and texts, we leverage an off-the-shelf object detector to identify and localize object instances, match labels of detected regions to concepts parsed from captions, and thus create ""pseudo"" labels for learning scene graph. Further, we design a Transformer-based model to predict these ""pseudo"" labels via a masked token prediction task. Learning from only image-sentence pairs, our model achieves 30% relative gain over a latest method trained with human-annotated unlocalized scene graphs. Our model also shows strong results for weakly and fully supervised scene graph generation. In addition, we explore an open-vocabulary setting for detecting scene graphs, and present the first result for open-set scene graph generation.

We first generate a diverse set of possible scene graphs using templates, then use reinforcement learning to optimize their quality based on the difference between predicted and ground truth scene graphs obtained through human annotation. Our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scene graph generation tasks while demonstrating promising results for zero-shot retrieval, VQA, and visual story generation. Our model learns to predict accurate relationship annotations that are validated by further human evaluation.

Current state-of-the-art architectures are found with neural architecture search (NAS) taking model complexity into account. However, designing of the search space suitable for specific hardware is still a challenging task.

"Artificial neural networks play a key role in many emerging artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics control.

"Success of deep neural networks in diverse tasks across domains of computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing, has necessitated understanding the dynamics of training process and also working of trained models. Two independent contributions of this paper are 1) Novel activation function for faster training convergence 2) Systematic pruning of filters of models trained irrespective of activation function. We analyze the topological transformation of the space of training samples as it gets transformed by each successive layer during training, by changing the activation function. The impact of changing activation function on the convergence during training is reported for the task of binary classification. A novel activation function aimed at faster convergence for classification tasks is proposed. Here, Betti numbers are used to quantify topological complexity of data. Results of experiments on popular synthetic binary classification datasets with large Betti numbers(150) using MLPs are reported. Results show that the proposed activation function results in faster convergence requiring fewer epochs by a factor of 1.5 to 2, since Betti numbers reduce faster across layers with the proposed activation function. The proposed methodology was verified on benchmark image datasets: fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and cat-vs-dog images, using CNNs. Based on empirical results, we propose a novel method for pruning a trained model. The trained model was pruned by eliminating filters that transform data to a topological space with large Betti numbers. All filters with Betti numbers greater than 300 were removed from each layer without significant reduction in accuracy. This resulted in faster prediction time and reduced memory size of the model.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous benchmark tasks across different domains such as image classification, natural language processing, etc. However, designing efficient DNN architectures that are both accurate and computationally efficient remains challenging. This paper proposes the use of topological framework for designing activation functions and pruning techniques that can improve the efficiency of DNN models without compromising their accuracy. Firstly, we introduce a novel approach for constructing activation functions by exploiting concepts from algebraic topology. Our proposed method involves computing persistence landscapes associated with ReLU layers of the network using persistent homology theory. We then train these customized activation functions together with the weight parameters using backpropagation. Secondly, we utilize a similar idea based on Betti numbers to determine which connections contribute significantly to model prediction and hence, we perform model pruning by discarding insignificant ones. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our topological methods result in significant improvements in terms of model size, computational time, memory usage and even better performance compared to popular baseline models. These advantages make our proposed framework particularly appealing for real-world applications where resources are limited yet high precision is essential, such as edge devices and embedded systems. By leveraging the power of topology, we are able to create more effective and efficient neural models that can tackle complex tasks while meeting stringent hardware constraints. Therefore, this research provides valuable insights into the development of next generation machine learning algorithms.",1

"In recent years, data-to-text (D2T) generation has become increasingly important due to its potential applications in a variety of fields such as medicine, finance, and customer service. However, despite significant advancements in D2T technology, generating high-quality biomedical text remains challenging due to the complexities inherent in medical language.  To address these challenges, we propose fine-tuning transformer models on large amounts of biomedical data for improved performance. We evaluate our approach using multiple metrics including BLEU score, ROUGE-L recall, self-BLEU score, and perplexity score. Our results show that fine-tuned transformer models outperform baseline methods across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, we perform qualitative analysis by manually evaluating the generated outputs against human-written reference texts and find that our proposed method produces more accurate and informative biomedical summaries.

"Text-to-image synthesis aims to generate a photo-realistic image from a given natural language description. Previous works have made significant progress with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Nonetheless, it is still hard to generate intact objects or clear textures (Fig 1). To address this issue, we propose Feature-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (FA-GAN) to synthesize a high-quality image by integrating two techniques: a self-supervised discriminator and a feature-aware loss. First, we design a self-supervised discriminator with an auxiliary decoder so that the discriminator can extract better representation. Secondly, we introduce a feature-aware loss to provide the generator more direct supervision by employing the feature representation from the self-supervised discriminator. Experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show that our proposed method significantly advances the state-of-the-art FID score from 28.92 to 24.58.",0
"In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic images from text descriptions. However, these models often struggle with preserving important features specified in the input text while synthesizing new details that were absent in the original text description.

This method leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on specific features described in the text during image generation, resulting in more accurate and visually coherent output images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual fidelity and feature preservation.

"Deep neural networks usually require large labeled datasets for training to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, such as image classification and natural language processing. Although a lot of data is created each day by active Internet users, most of these data are unlabeled and are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. In this paper, we develop an efficient active learning method that requires fewer labeled instances and incorporates the technique of adversarial retraining in which additional labeled artificial data are generated without increasing the budget of the labeling. The generated adversarial examples also provide a way to measure the vulnerability of the model. To check the performance of the proposed method under an adversarial setting, i.e., malicious mislabeling and data poisoning attacks, we perform an extensive evaluation on the reduced CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains only two classes: airplane and frog. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active learning method is efficient for defending against malicious mislabeling and data poisoning attacks. Specifically, whereas the baseline active learning method based on the random sampling strategy performs poorly (about 50%) under a malicious mislabeling attack, the proposed active learning method can achieve the desired accuracy of 89% using only one-third of the dataset on average.",0
"In this paper we study active learning under adversarial attacks, where the attacker has full knowledge of the system and can manipulate labels intentionally. We assume two types of attack scenarios: poisoning attacks where the malicious samples can interfere with machine learning models by providing incorrect answers on purpose; and mislabeling attacks that cause label noise by modifying original annotations. Our contributions contain three aspects. Firstly, we present a theoretical framework of analyzing active learning systems under such attacks based on Bayesian analysis which shows how different parameters in the model change due to these attacks and thus affects the generalization performance. Secondly, we discuss several strategies to defend against these attacks such as detecting outliers by statistical tests or thresholding methods or utilizing regularizations like dropout. Finally, we verify our findings through comprehensive experiments including both synthetic datasets and real-world applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed defense mechanisms even under strong attacks. Compared to existing work which mainly focuses on passive learning without considering the interaction between human annotators and the model, this paper presents new insights into designing robust active learning systems with solid theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms.",1
"Vision Transformer (ViT) demonstrates that Transformer for natural language processing can be applied to computer vision tasks and result in comparable performance to convolutional neural networks (CNN), which have been studied and adopted in computer vision for years. This naturally raises the question of how the performance of ViT can be advanced with design techniques of CNN. To this end, we propose to incorporate two techniques and present ViT-ResNAS, an efficient multi-stage ViT architecture designed with neural architecture search (NAS). First, we propose residual spatial reduction to decrease sequence lengths for deeper layers and utilize a multi-stage architecture. When reducing lengths, we add skip connections to improve performance and stabilize training deeper networks. Second, we propose weight-sharing NAS with multi-architectural sampling. We enlarge a network and utilize its sub-networks to define a search space. A super-network covering all sub-networks is then trained for fast evaluation of their performance. To efficiently train the super-network, we propose to sample and train multiple sub-networks with one forward-backward pass. After that, evolutionary search is performed to discover high-performance network architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ViT-ResNAS achieves better accuracy-MACs and accuracy-throughput trade-offs than the original DeiT and other strong baselines of ViT.

"An agent that can understand natural-language instruction and carry out corresponding actions in the visual world is one of the long-term challenges of Artificial Intelligent (AI). Due to multifarious instructions from humans, it requires the agent can link natural language to vision and action in unstructured, previously unseen environments. If the instruction given by human is a navigation task, this challenge is called Visual-and-Language Navigation (VLN). It is a booming multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary practicality. Instead of focusing on the details of specific methods, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on VLN tasks and makes a classification carefully according the different characteristics of language instructions in these tasks. According to when the instructions are given, the tasks can be divided into single-turn and multi-turn. For single-turn tasks, we further divided them into goal-orientation and route-orientation based on whether the instructions contain a route. For multi-turn tasks, we divided them into imperative task and interactive task based on whether the agent responses to the instructions. This taxonomy enable researchers to better grasp the key point of a specific task and identify directions for future research.",0
"In recent years we have seen a shift towards data intensive approaches in computer vision that utilize large amounts of annotated training data, powerful deep learning models, and high performance GPUs. As these systems become more prevalent they must also be able to function in environments that can not rely on constant connectivity, massive storage resources, nor specialized hardware such as graphic processing units (GPU). Our work explores techniques for enabling navigation using visual input alone, without GPS and without any other external sensors than those commonly found on consumer mobile devices. We survey both traditional image based approaches such as object recognition but also newer paradigms such as scene understanding which combine elements from prior knowledge graphs, landmark detection, and semantic segmentation. We then propose a taxonomy that breaks down the state of art into three main axes: data driven vs model free methods, single view vs multiple views, static representations vs dynamic representations. This allows us to identify several common problems among the different research areas, and lay out future directions for research and real world applications. Finally we present an open source implementation of our framework which uses Google’s MobileNet SSD detector along side the LSTM networks of Google’s SLAM cell as well as Openstreetmap maps as part of a realtime multi threaded application that runs at over 27 frames per second.

"Deep learning approaches have produced substantial breakthroughs in fields such as image classification and natural language processing and are making rapid inroads in the area of protein design. Many generative models of proteins have been developed that encompass all known protein sequences, model specific protein families, or extrapolate the dynamics of individual proteins. Those generative models can learn protein representations that are often more informative of protein structure and function than hand-engineered features. Furthermore, they can be used to quickly propose millions of novel proteins that resemble the native counterparts in terms of expression level, stability, or other attributes. The protein design process can further be guided by discriminative oracles to select candidates with the highest probability of having the desired properties. In this review, we discuss five classes of generative models that have been most successful at modeling proteins and provide a framework for model guided protein design.",0

"Adversarial training has been proven to be a powerful regularization method to improve the generalization of models. However, current adversarial training methods only attack the original input sample or the embedding vectors, and their attacks lack coverage and diversity. To further enhance the breadth and depth of attack, we propose a novel masked weight adversarial training method called DropAttack, which enhances generalization of model by adding intentionally worst-case adversarial perturbations to both the input and hidden layers in different dimensions and minimize the adversarial risks generated by each layer. DropAttack is a general technique and can be adopt to a wide variety of neural networks with different architectures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we used five public datasets in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) for experimental evaluating. We compare the proposed method with other adversarial training methods and regularization methods, and our method achieves state-of-the-art on all datasets. In addition, Dropattack can achieve the same performance when it use only a half training data compared to other standard training method. Theoretical analysis reveals that DropAttack can perform gradient regularization at random on some of the input and wight parameters of the model. Further visualization experiments show that DropAttack can push the minimum risk of the model to a lower and flatter loss landscapes.

"DropAttack: A New Technique To Increase Accuracy Of Machine Learning Models by Imitating Human Thought Processes  Dropout was introduced as a regularization method that has been proven effective at improving the generalization performance of deep neural networks (DNN). However, there remains considerable room for improvement in terms of accuracy since dropout only removes random neurons from hidden layers during training. On the other hand, adversarial attacks have shown promise for evaluating how robust models can detect changes caused by inputs injected in their latent space, however such techniques require significant computational resources.  In order to tackle these issues we propose a new technique called ""DropAttack"" which combines aspects from both data augmentation and model perturbations using adversarial examples. Our approach consists of generating adversarial noise samples from input images by applying spatial transformations. By applying random translations to the original image and training DNNs with those transformed samples our model learns to adapt to different scenarios and increases its capacity of understanding the underlying task. For every epoch, the translation parameters are reinitialized so that the drop attack remains efficient. Moreover, we demonstrate experimentally that the proposed method leads to improved test set accuracy over other state-of-the-art methods like Fast.AI or Hugging Face transformers.  Overall, our results show that integrating human thought processes into machine learning algorithms through the generation of adversarial examples via data augmentation significantly improve the performances of neural network models. The proposed methodology provides insights into how humans might process information in the brain while demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving better accuracy on real world tasks.

"Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people's attitudes from multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels. However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels. Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types (i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover, M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal models for sentiment analysis.",0
"Title: M2Lens: Visualizing and Explaining Multimodal Models for Sentiment Analysis  M2Lens is a comprehensive framework that integrates state-of-the-art techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), offering novel solutions that overcome limitations posed by single modal models and their pretraining on limited datasets. By designing specialized modules tailored for each modality, we enable cross-modality attention fusion that adapts to different tasks such as text-only sentiment analysis, image+text fusion, audio+video sentiment analysis, etc., yielding superior performance compared to single modality methods.

For instance, these techniques can identify which part(s) of an image or review contribute most to classification outcomes. Our extensive experiments verify that our methods significantly improve over baseline results using public benchmark datasets.

"Deep neural network (DNN) model compression for efficient on-device inference is becoming increasingly important to reduce memory requirements and keep user data on-device. To this end, we propose a novel differentiable k-means clustering layer (DKM) and its application to train-time weight clustering-based DNN model compression. DKM casts k-means clustering as an attention problem and enables joint optimization of the parameters and clustering centroids. Unlike prior works that rely on additional regularizers and parameters, DKM-based compression keeps the original loss function and model architecture fixed. We evaluated DKM-based compression on various DNN models for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our results demonstrate that DMK delivers superior compression and accuracy trade-off on ImageNet1k and GLUE benchmarks. For example, DKM-based compression can offer 74.5% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy on ResNet50 DNN model with 3.3MB model size (29.4x model compression factor). For MobileNet-v1, which is a challenging DNN to compress, DKM delivers 62.8% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy with 0.74 MB model size (22.4x model compression factor). This result is 6.8% higher top-1 accuracy and 33% relatively smaller model size than the current state-of-the-art DNN compression algorithms. Additionally, DKM enables compression of DistilBERT model by 11.8x with minimal (1.1%) accuracy loss on GLUE NLP benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have proven to be highly effective at solving complex tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed several methods for compressing neural network models without sacrificing their performance significantly. One promising approach is to use clustering algorithms to group similar weights together, reducing the size of the model while preserving its functionality.  In this work, we propose the ""DKM"" layer, which combines differential programming and k-means clustering for deep neural network compression. By leveraging the flexibility of automatic differentiation and the efficiency of k-means, our method effectively groups similar weights into clusters that can be represented using shared parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that the DKM layer improves both accuracy and speed compared to existing compression techniques. Moreover, we showcase the utility of our method by successfully compressing state-of-the-art vision models for object detection and image segmentation.

"Spatio-temporal representational learning has been widely adopted in various fields such as action recognition, video object segmentation, and action anticipation. Previous spatio-temporal representational learning approaches primarily employ ConvNets or sequential models,e.g., LSTM, to learn the intra-frame and inter-frame features. Recently, Transformer models have successfully dominated the study of natural language processing (NLP), image classification, etc. However, the pure-Transformer based spatio-temporal learning can be prohibitively costly on memory and computation to extract fine-grained features from a tiny patch. To tackle the training difficulty and enhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer design in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our shifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame variances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model long-term temporal dependencies. We conduct thorough ablation studies to validate each component and hyper-parameters in our shifted chunk Transformer, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.

Our momentumized, adaptive, dual averaged gradient (MADA) method uses weight updates that incorporate both past and current gradients, allowing for better tracking of nonstationary environments. Additionally, our method dynamically adjusts learning rates based on recent performance, further improving adaptability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MADA outperforms state-of-the-art stochastic optimizers across a range of machine learning tasks, including logistic regression, neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning.

"Transformers have shown impressive performance in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks, due to the capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Recent progress has demonstrated to combine such transformers with CNN-based semantic image segmentation models is very promising. However, it is not well studied yet on how well a pure transformer based approach can achieve for image segmentation. In this work, we explore a novel framework for semantic image segmentation, which is encoder-decoder based Fully Transformer Networks (FTN). Specifically, we first propose a Pyramid Group Transformer (PGT) as the encoder for progressively learning hierarchical features, while reducing the computation complexity of the standard visual transformer(ViT). Then, we propose a Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT) to fuse semantic-level and spatial-level information from multiple levels of the PGT encoder for semantic image segmentation.

"Web Image Context Extraction (WICE) consists in obtaining the textual information describing an image using the content of the surrounding webpage. A common preprocessing step before performing WICE is to render the content of the webpage. When done at a large scale (e.g., for search engine indexation), it may become very computationally costly (up to several seconds per page). To avoid this cost, we introduce a novel WICE approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Natural Language Processing models. Our method relies on a graph model containing both node types and text as features. The model is fed through several blocks of GNNs to extract the textual context. Since no labeled WICE dataset with ground truth exists, we train and evaluate the GNNs on a proxy task that consists in finding the semantically closest text to the image caption. We then interpret importance weights to find the most relevant text nodes and define them as the image context. Thanks to GNNs, our model is able to encode both structural and semantic information from the webpage. We show that our approach gives promising results to help address the large-scale WICE problem using only HTML data.",0

"There is an increasing demand for scalable algorithms capable of clustering and analyzing large time series datasets. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of unsupervised artificial neural network for visualizing and clustering complex data, reducing the dimensionality of data, and selecting influential features. Like all clustering methods, the SOM requires a measure of similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer given that it accommodates the distortions when aligning time series. Despite its use in clustering, DTW is limited in practice because it is quadratic in runtime complexity with the length of the time series data. To address this, we present a new DTW-based clustering method, called SOMTimeS (a Self-Organizing Map for TIME Series), that scales better and runs faster than other DTW-based clustering algorithms, and has similar performance accuracy. The computational performance of SOMTimeS stems from its ability to prune unnecessary DTW computations during the SOM's training phase. We also implemented a similar pruning strategy for K-means for comparison with one of the top performing clustering algorithms. We evaluated the pruning effectiveness, accuracy, execution time and scalability on 112 benchmark time series datasets from the University of California, Riverside classification archive. We showed that for similar accuracy, the speed-up achieved for SOMTimeS and K-means was 1.8x on average; however, rates varied between 1x and 18x depending on the dataset. SOMTimeS and K-means pruned 43% and 50% of the total DTW computations, respectively. We applied SOMtimeS to natural language conversation data collected as part of a large healthcare cohort study of patient-clinician serious illness conversations to demonstrate the algorithm's utility with complex, temporally sequenced phenomena.",0

This paper focuses on addressing two challenges: handling long sequence of subtasks, and understanding complex human instructions. We propose Episodic Transformer (E.T.), a multimodal transformer that encodes language inputs and the full episode history of visual observations and actions. To improve training, we leverage synthetic instructions as an intermediate representation that decouples understanding the visual appearance of an environment from the variations of natural language instructions. We demonstrate that encoding the history with a transformer is critical to solve compositional tasks, and that pretraining and joint training with synthetic instructions further improve the performance.

"We investigate Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which outputs a segmentation map corresponding to the given natural language description. To solve RIS efficiently, we need to understand each word's relationship with other words, each region in the image to other regions, and cross-modal alignment between linguistic and visual domains. We argue that one of the limiting factors in the recent methods is that they do not handle these interactions simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel architecture called JRNet, which uses a Joint Reasoning Module(JRM) to concurrently capture the inter-modal and intra-modal interactions. The output of JRM is passed through a novel Cross-Modal Multi-Level Fusion (CMMLF) module which further refines the segmentation masks by exchanging contextual information across visual hierarchy through linguistic features acting as a bridge.

Furthermore, we analyzed the data collected during testing to better understand the impact of multi-modal interactions on the quality of image segmentation. These results have important implications for real-world scenarios that require precise image segmentation.",1
"Activation functions play a pivotal role in determining the training dynamics and neural network performance. The widely adopted activation function ReLU despite being simple and effective has few disadvantages including the Dying ReLU problem. In order to tackle such problems, we propose a novel activation function called Serf which is self-regularized and nonmonotonic in nature. Like Mish, Serf also belongs to the Swish family of functions. Based on several experiments on computer vision (image classification and object detection) and natural language processing (machine translation, sentiment classification and multimodal entailment) tasks with different state-of-the-art architectures, it is observed that Serf vastly outperforms ReLU (baseline) and other activation functions including both Swish and Mish, with a markedly bigger margin on deeper architectures. Ablation studies further demonstrate that Serf based architectures perform better than those of Swish and Mish in varying scenarios, validating the effectiveness and compatibility of Serf with varying depth, complexity, optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, initializers and dropout rates. Finally, we investigate the mathematical relation between Swish and Serf, thereby showing the impact of preconditioner function ingrained in the first derivative of Serf which provides a regularization effect making gradients smoother and optimization faster.",0
"Title: A New Perspective on Training Deep Neural Networks In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing more effective error functions that can improve the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). Among these error functions, SoftPlus has become popular due to its ability to handle both positive and negative inputs without exploding gradients. However, the implementation of SoftPlus can be computationally expensive and may introduce numerical instability during backpropagation. In this paper, we propose a new activation function called Log-SoftPlus Error (SERF) that addresses these issues while preserving the benefits of SoftPlus. Our proposed activation function combines the advantages of SoftPlus with those of Swish and Tanh functions, resulting in improved gradient flow and faster convergence speed compared to existing alternatives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. Overall, our findings suggest that SERF provides a promising alternative for training DNNs, particularly in resource-constrained environments where computational efficiency is crucial.",1
"Most existing image retrieval systems use text queries as a way for the user to express what they are looking for. However, fine-grained image retrieval often requires the ability to also express where in the image the content they are looking for is. The text modality can only cumbersomely express such localization preferences, whereas pointing is a more natural fit. In this paper, we propose an image retrieval setup with a new form of multimodal queries, where the user simultaneously uses both spoken natural language (the what) and mouse traces over an empty canvas (the where) to express the characteristics of the desired target image. We then describe simple modifications to an existing image retrieval model, enabling it to operate in this setup. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our model effectively takes this spatial guidance into account, and provides significantly more accurate retrieval results compared to text-only equivalent systems.",0
"Title: Telling the What while Pointing to the Where: Multimodal Queries for Image Retrieval Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to image retrieval that combines natural language queries with visual gesture pointing. The proposed method uses deep learning techniques to fuse textual and visual information into a single vector representation, which can then be used to retrieve relevant images from a large database. Experimental results show significant improvements over traditional text-based methods and demonstrate the potential of multimodal approaches in image retrieval tasks. The paper concludes by discussing future research directions and possible applications of the proposed method in areas such as search engines, e-commerce, and human-computer interaction.",1
"Facial action unit (FAU) intensities are popular descriptors for the analysis of facial behavior. However, FAUs are sparsely represented when only a few are activated at a time. In this study, we explore the possibility of representing the dynamics of facial expressions by adopting algorithms used for word representation in natural language processing. Specifically, we perform clustering on a large dataset of temporal facial expressions with 5.3M frames before applying the Global Vector representation (GloVe) algorithm to learn the embeddings of the facial clusters. We evaluate the usefulness of our learned representations on two downstream tasks: schizophrenia symptom estimation and depression severity regression. These experimental results show the potential effectiveness of our approach for improving the assessment of mental health symptoms over baseline models that use FAU intensities alone.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to modeling facial behavior dynamics for mental health assessment. We propose using machine learning algorithms to analyze subtle changes in facial movements during natural conversations as indicators of cognitive and emotional states. Our methodology involves collecting large datasets of human subjects engaging in spontaneous social interactions while their facial expressions and vocal cues are recorded. These data are then preprocessed to extract relevant features that capture temporal variations in muscle activation, head gestures, and speech prosody. Using these features, we train models that can classify different levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. By comparing our results against standard clinical evaluations, we show promising correlations between facial behaviors and mental health outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications of our system in personalized therapy, remote monitoring, and self-assessment tools. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards developing non-invasive technologies capable of inferring mental states from sensorimotor signals.",1
"Infographics are documents designed to effectively communicate information using a combination of textual, graphical and visual elements. In this work, we explore the automatic understanding of infographic images by using Visual Question Answering technique.To this end, we present InfographicVQA, a new dataset that comprises a diverse collection of infographics along with natural language questions and answers annotations. The collected questions require methods to jointly reason over the document layout, textual content, graphical elements, and data visualizations. We curate the dataset with emphasis on questions that require elementary reasoning and basic arithmetic skills.

Results show significant improvements over baseline methods, demonstrating the potential utility of pre-training for VQA tasks. We discuss limitations and future directions for research in this area. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into how pre-trained models can enhance performance in complex vision tasks.",1
"Transformer architectures have become the model of choice in natural language processing and are now being introduced into computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, in the field of human pose estimation, convolutional architectures still remain dominant. In this work, we present PoseFormer, a purely transformer-based approach for 3D human pose estimation in videos without convolutional architectures involved. Inspired by recent developments in vision transformers, we design a spatial-temporal transformer structure to comprehensively model the human joint relations within each frame as well as the temporal correlations across frames, then output an accurate 3D human pose of the center frame. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on two popular and standard benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments show that PoseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/zczcwh/PoseFormer}",0
"Deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on 2D human pose estimation tasks by leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that learn to extract features from images. However, extending these models to estimate 3D human pose remains challenging due to occlusions and depth ambiguities present in RGB images. In this work, we propose SpatioTemporal Transformer (STT), which explicitly models the spatial relationships within a single frame and captures temporal dependencies across video frames. Our STT model estimates both 2D keypoint heatmaps and predicts a camera view transformation vector field between two consecutive frames, enabling us to infer accurate 3D poses without relying solely on image intensities. We demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches using standard benchmark datasets such as Human3.6M and IJB-A. Additionally, qualitative evaluations indicate more accurate estimations of joint locations, particularly in cases where the subject is partially occluded or in close proximity to others. Overall, our contributions enable the use of deep learning techniques to achieve highly reliable and detailed predictions for 3D human poses from monocular videos.",1
"The concern regarding users' data privacy has risen to its highest level due to the massive increase in communication platforms, social networking sites, and greater users' participation in online public discourse. An increasing number of people exchange private information via emails, text messages, and social media without being aware of the risks and implications. Researchers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have concentrated on creating tools and strategies to identify, categorize, and sanitize private information in text data since a substantial amount of data is exchanged in textual form. However, most of the detection methods solely rely on the existence of pre-identified keywords in the text and disregard the inference of the underlying meaning of the utterance in a specific context. Hence, in some situations, these tools and algorithms fail to detect disclosure, or the produced results are miss-classified. In this paper, we propose a multi-input, multi-output hybrid neural network which utilizes transfer-learning, linguistics, and metadata to learn the hidden patterns. Our goal is to better classify disclosure/non-disclosure content in terms of the context of situation. We trained and evaluated our model on a human-annotated ground truth dataset, containing a total of 5,400 tweets. The results show that the proposed model was able to identify privacy disclosure through tweets with an accuracy of 77.4% while classifying the information type of those tweets with an impressive accuracy of 99%, by jointly learning for two separate tasks.",0
"This paper presents a multi-input multi-output transformer-based hybrid neural network (MIMOTHN) architecture designed specifically for multi-class privacy disclosure detection tasks in natural language processing applications. Using input sources such as contextual text data along with audio signals allows MIMOTHN to capture both semantic and prosodic cues in order to make accurate predictions on whether sensitive information has been revealed. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other baseline models. Furthermore, ablation studies show the importance of incorporating both audio and text inputs into our system. Overall, MIMOTHN provides an effective solution for detecting privacy violations in speech-to-text conversion systems.",1
"Describing images using natural language is widely known as image captioning, which has made consistent progress due to the development of computer vision and natural language generation techniques. Though conventional captioning models achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few pioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions, which focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between objects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same album or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the distinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning Model (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a group-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that are unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other images). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions, resulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in the ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and GMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate (DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of several baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both accuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the quantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric DisWordRate.",0
"In recent years, image captioning has become an increasingly important area of research in computer vision and natural language processing. One challenge that arises in image captioning is how to generate descriptive and distinctive captions that accurately capture the content of the image while also making them unique from other captions that may describe similar images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called group-based distinctive image captioning (GDIC).  Our method uses memory attention mechanisms to store and retrieve relevant visual features and semantic concepts associated with each image in our dataset. We then introduce two types of groups: image clusters based on their visual similarity, and word clusters based on their semantic meaning within a fixed vocabulary. For each caption generation step, we attend over different groups simultaneously using a shared attention mechanism, which allows us to leverage both visual and semantic cues effectively. By doing so, we can better differentiate among visually similar images and ensure that generated captions are more diverse and distinctive compared to previous methods.  We evaluate our GDIC model on several public benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art results across all metrics. Our ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our proposed design choices, including the use of multiple groups for attending over related data entities and regularization techniques such as adversarial training to encourage diversity among generated captions. Overall, our work presents a significant contribution towards improving the quality and uniqueness of automatic image captions.",1
"Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to enable embodied agents to navigate in realistic environments using natural language instructions. Given the scarcity of domain-specific training data and the high diversity of image and language inputs, the generalization of VLN agents to unseen environments remains challenging. Recent methods explore pretraining to improve generalization, however, the use of generic image-caption datasets or existing small-scale VLN environments is suboptimal and results in limited improvements. In this work, we introduce BnB, a large-scale and diverse in-domain VLN dataset. We first collect image-caption (IC) pairs from hundreds of thousands of listings from online rental marketplaces. Using IC pairs we next propose automatic strategies to generate millions of VLN path-instruction (PI) pairs. We further propose a shuffling loss that improves the learning of temporal order inside PI pairs. We use BnB pretrain our Airbert model that can be adapted to discriminative and generative settings and show that it outperforms state of the art for Room-to-Room (R2R) navigation and Remote Referring Expression (REVERIE) benchmarks. Moreover, our in-domain pretraining significantly increases performance on a challenging few-shot VLN evaluation, where we train the model only on VLN instructions from a few houses.",0
"This paper presents Airbert, a pretraining method designed to improve zero-shot performance on vision-and-language navigation tasks by transferring knowledge from existing image captioning datasets. By leveraging large amounts of data and distilling key features such as object detection, attention mechanisms, and natural language generation, we demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art models across multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we showcase how Airbert can effectively adapt to new domains without any additional training, thereby highlighting its generalization capabilities. Overall, these results provide evidence of the effectiveness and potential real-world applications of our approach in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision.",1
"Neural networks are well-known to be vulnerable to imperceptible perturbations in the input, called adversarial examples, that result in misclassification. Generating adversarial examples for source code poses an additional challenge compared to the domains of images and natural language, because source code perturbations must retain the functional meaning of the code. We identify a striking relationship between token frequency statistics and learned token embeddings: the L2 norm of learned token embeddings increases with the frequency of the token except for the highest-frequnecy tokens. We leverage this relationship to construct a simple and efficient gradient-free method for generating state-of-the-art adversarial examples on models of code. Our method empirically outperforms competing gradient-based methods with less information and less computational effort.",0
"Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to generating adversarial examples against models trained on code. Unlike traditional methods that rely on gradients to guide the attack, our method uses a simple optimization procedure that requires no gradient information. Our attacks can generate meaningful adversaries using only black box access to the model, making them both efficient and effective. We evaluate our approach across several benchmarks and show that we achieve state-of-the-art results while significantly outperforming existing gradient-based techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our generated adversaries by applying them to real-world applications such as source code plagiarism detection. Our work highlights the need for improved defense mechanisms against these types of attacks and suggests new research directions in the field of program synthesis and vulnerability analysis. Keywords: Adversarial examples, Program synthesis, Source code plagiarism detection",1
"Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive predictive performance by learning complex functions of many variables, often at the cost of interpretability. This chapter covers recent work aiming to interpret models by attributing importance to features and feature groups for a single prediction. Importantly, the proposed attributions assign importance to interactions between features, in addition to features in isolation. These attributions are shown to yield insights across real-world domains, including bio-imaging, cosmology image and natural-language processing. We then show how these attributions can be used to directly improve the generalization of a neural network or to distill it into a simple model. Throughout the chapter, we emphasize the use of reality checks to scrutinize the proposed interpretation techniques.",0
"Reality checking is becoming increasingly important as machine learning methods such as deep learning continue to gain popularity and are applied to more complex real-world problems. This paper presents several techniques that can improve the accuracy and interpretability of deep-learning models by incorporating knowledge from external sources into their training process. By grounding these models in the physical world, we can increase their robustness and generalization performance while also making them easier to explain and debug. Our approach uses simple, interpretable visual features and geometric constraints derived from human demonstrations, images, videos, or even textual descriptions to guide the model towards semantically meaningful solutions. We show through experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets that our method leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art results across different domains including computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and control systems. These findings highlight the importance of integrating domain expertise into neural network architectures and demonstrate how reality checks can serve as a powerful tool for enhancing their capabilities while addressing fundamental challenges related to explainability, transfer learning, active perception, interactive decision making under uncertainty, and safe exploration. Overall, this work represents a step towards building more reliable and trustworthy artificial intelligence applications that can operate effectively in dynamic environments beyond controlled laboratory settings.

"Recently, there has been an increasing number of efforts to introduce models capable of generating natural language explanations (NLEs) for their predictions on vision-language (VL) tasks. Such models are appealing, because they can provide human-friendly and comprehensive explanations. However, there is a lack of comparison between existing methods, which is due to a lack of re-usable evaluation frameworks and a scarcity of datasets. In this work, we introduce e-ViL and e-SNLI-VE. e-ViL is a benchmark for explainable vision-language tasks that establishes a unified evaluation framework and provides the first comprehensive comparison of existing approaches that generate NLEs for VL tasks. It spans four models and three datasets and both automatic metrics and human evaluation are used to assess model-generated explanations. e-SNLI-VE is currently the largest existing VL dataset with NLEs (over 430k instances). We also propose a new model that combines UNITER, which learns joint embeddings of images and text, and GPT-2, a pre-trained language model that is well-suited for text generation. It surpasses the previous state of the art by a large margin across all datasets. Code and data are available here: https://github.com/maximek3/e-ViL.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can perform complex tasks such as image classification, object detection, and natural language understanding. However, despite these advances, many of these systems still lack the ability to provide clear and concise explanations for their decision making processes, which can make them difficult to interpret and trust by human users. To address this issue, we present e-ViL, a new dataset and benchmark designed specifically for evaluating natural language explanations in vision-language tasks.  The e-ViL dataset consists of pairs of images and associated questions posed by humans, along with detailed explanations provided by annotators to explain why certain answers are correct or incorrect. These explanations cover a wide range of topics, including object recognition, scene understanding, and reasoning. By providing both question-answer pairs and corresponding explanations, the e-ViL dataset allows researchers to evaluate the quality of generated explanations relative to human standards. Additionally, the dataset includes evaluation metrics for measuring the accuracy and coherence of generated explanations.  We also propose several baseline models for generating natural language explanations using techniques from text generation and explanation selection. We evaluate these models on our dataset and show that while they can generate plausible explanations, they fall short of human performance on multiple aspects of explanation quality. Finally, we discuss future directions and potential applications of the e-ViL dataset, including improving transparency and accountability in AI systems and enabling better collaboration between humans and machines. Overall, the e-ViL dataset and benchmark represent a step forward towards building more transparent and interpretable AI systems for the benefit of society.",1
"We propose UniT, a Unified Transformer model to simultaneously learn the most prominent tasks across different domains, ranging from object detection to natural language understanding and multimodal reasoning. Based on the transformer encoder-decoder architecture, our UniT model encodes each input modality with an encoder and makes predictions on each task with a shared decoder over the encoded input representations, followed by task-specific output heads. The entire model is jointly trained end-to-end with losses from each task. Compared to previous efforts on multi-task learning with transformers, we share the same model parameters across all tasks instead of separately fine-tuning task-specific models and handle a much higher variety of tasks across different domains. In our experiments, we learn 7 tasks jointly over 8 datasets, achieving strong performance on each task with significantly fewer parameters. Our code is available in MMF at https://mmf.sh.",0
"This paper describes two novel contributions to deep learning and computer vision: UniT (Unified Task), which can learn multimodal tasks using a single model trained on multiple modalities (such as image and text data) in parallel, without needing separate models; and UniT multitask learning, which trains one UniT model on many different task types simultaneously, dramatically reducing training time and improving generalization performance. Both approaches use the popular Transformer architecture but replace self attention modules with more efficient variants tailored for each modality type. Experiments show that these methods achieve state-of-the-art results across several challenging datasets and task types, making them valuable tools for practitioners working in computer vision and beyond. By enabling fast and accurate simultaneous processing of diverse data sources, UniT represents a significant step toward realizing fully integrated artificial intelligence systems that can adapt flexibly to complex environments and user needs. We hope future research along similar lines will enable even greater advances by building upon and expanding our work herein.",1
"For many fundamental scene understanding tasks, it is difficult or impossible to obtain per-pixel ground truth labels from real images. We address this challenge by introducing Hypersim, a photorealistic synthetic dataset for holistic indoor scene understanding. To create our dataset, we leverage a large repository of synthetic scenes created by professional artists, and we generate 77,400 images of 461 indoor scenes with detailed per-pixel labels and corresponding ground truth geometry. Our dataset: (1) relies exclusively on publicly available 3D assets; (2) includes complete scene geometry, material information, and lighting information for every scene; (3) includes dense per-pixel semantic instance segmentations and complete camera information for every image; and (4) factors every image into diffuse reflectance, diffuse illumination, and a non-diffuse residual term that captures view-dependent lighting effects.   We analyze our dataset at the level of scenes, objects, and pixels, and we analyze costs in terms of money, computation time, and annotation effort. Remarkably, we find that it is possible to generate our entire dataset from scratch, for roughly half the cost of training a popular open-source natural language processing model. We also evaluate sim-to-real transfer performance on two real-world scene understanding tasks - semantic segmentation and 3D shape prediction - where we find that pre-training on our dataset significantly improves performance on both tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the most challenging Pix3D test set. All of our rendered image data, as well as all the code we used to generate our dataset and perform our experiments, is available online.",0
"Realistic synthetic data has been shown to effectively augment real world datasets in computer vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, visual odometry, etc., however these datasets often suffer from limited scale and variability which can lead to poor generalization performance.

"Protein is linked to almost every life process. Therefore, analyzing the biological structure and property of protein sequences is critical to the exploration of life, as well as disease detection and drug discovery. Traditional protein analysis methods tend to be labor-intensive and time-consuming. The emergence of deep learning models makes modeling data patterns in large quantities of data possible. Interdisciplinary researchers have begun to leverage deep learning methods to model large biological datasets, e.g. using long short-term memory and convolutional neural network for protein sequence classification. After millions of years of evolution, evolutionary information is encoded in protein sequences. Inspired by the similarity between natural language and protein sequences, we use large-scale language models to model evolutionary-scale protein sequences, encoding protein biology information in representation. Significant improvements are observed in both token-level and sequence-level tasks, demonstrating that our large-scale model can accurately capture evolution information from pretraining on evolutionary-scale individual sequences. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/THUDM/ProteinLM.",0
"In modern structural biology, there exists a bottleneck at the stage of structure determination due to protein crystallization failure.

"Deep learning research has recently witnessed an impressively fast-paced progress in a wide range of tasks including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. The extraordinary performance of these systems often gives the impression that they can be used to revolutionise our lives for the better. However, as recent works point out, these systems suffer from several issues that make them unreliable for use in the real world, including vulnerability to adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al. [248]), tendency to memorise noise (Zhang et al. [292]), being over-confident on incorrect predictions (miscalibration) (Guo et al. [99]), and unsuitability for handling private data (Gilad-Bachrach et al. [88]). In this thesis, we look at each of these issues in detail, investigate their causes, and propose computationally cheap algorithms for mitigating them in practice. To do this, we identify structures in deep neural networks that can be exploited to mitigate the above causes of unreliability of deep learning algorithms.",0
"Sure! Here is a possible abstract:  Deep learning has revolutionized many fields by enabling computers to learn from data without explicit guidance. However, deep neural networks can easily become unreliable if they lack robustness against small perturbations, noise, or changes to input distributions. In this work, we propose a general framework that identifies and exploits structures inherent to any problem domain to improve reliability. Our method consists of two components: structure identification and exploitation. Structure identification involves analyzing the loss landscape and finding regularities that allow us to separate the regions where models perform well versus poorly, such as plateaus or ridges. We then show how these insights can inform model design choices like initialization, activation functions, batch normalization parameters, architectures, etc., which collectively make up our methods for structure exploitation. Our framework enables consistent improvement across tasks and datasets regardless of scale or complexity, outperforming prior art while remaining broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image classification using popular benchmarks CIFAR and ImageNet, showing improved test set performance and more reliable behavior under common distribution shift scenarios. Finally, we showcase our results through interactive visualizations and human evaluators, highlighting their utility in decision making contexts. Overall, our method provides significant advances towards producing more trustworthy and dependable artificial intelligence systems.

"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning and are widely deployed in many applications involving image, video, speech and natural language processing. The increasing compute demands of DNNs have been widely addressed through Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized accelerators. However, as model sizes grow, these von Neumann architectures require very high memory bandwidth to keep the processing elements utilized as a majority of the data resides in the main memory. Processing in memory has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall bottleneck for ML workloads. In this work, we propose a new DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) multiplication primitive coupled with intra-bank accumulation to accelerate matrix vector operations in ML workloads. The proposed multiplication primitive adds  1% area overhead and does not require any change in the DRAM peripherals. Therefore, the proposed multiplication can be easily adopted in commodity DRAM chips. Subsequently, we design a DRAM-based PIM architecture, data mapping scheme and dataflow for executing DNNs within DRAM. System evaluations performed on networks like AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet18 show that the proposed architecture, mapping, and data flow can provide up to 19.5x speedup over an NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU highlighting the need to overcome the memory bottleneck in future generations of DNN hardware.",0
"As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision making, machine learning workloads have become more prevalent. However, traditional computer systems struggle to meet the performance demands of these workloads due to their reliance on slow disks and limited memory bandwidth. To address this issue, researchers propose utilizing processing in commodity dynamic random access memory (PIM-DRAM), which enables computation within the memory itself. This approach has shown promise in recent studies, but there remains room for improvement. In this paper, we aim to explore how PIM-DRAM can accelerate machine learning workloads by conducting experiments on real hardware platforms. We evaluate several state-of-the-art frameworks for training and inference across multiple benchmarks, including popular models such as ResNet-56 and BERT. Our results demonstrate that PIM-DRAM significantly reduces latency while maintaining high levels of accuracy compared to conventional methods. Additionally, our findings suggest that PIM-DRAM could potentially enable new use cases where machine learning was previously impractical given computational constraints. Overall, our study provides insights into the benefits and limitations of PIM-DRAM for acceleration in large-scale machine learning tasks and encourages further development in this area.",1
"Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative model for a drastically different shape representation --- describing a shape as a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer. We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset consisting of 178,238 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.",0
"This paper presents a new method called DeepCAD that can generate high quality three dimensional models suitable for use in computer-aided design (CAD). Our approach builds on recent advances in deep generative networks by training a neural network to predict 3D shapes given a set of input parameters. We show that our model can accurately predict detailed geometric features such as corners, curves, and chamfers, allowing us to generate complex shapes that are difficult to create manually. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method can be used to improve existing CAD systems by generating templates and guiding manual construction of designs. Finally, we compare our results against other state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate significant improvements across several metrics. Overall, DeepCAD represents a major step towards fully automating the process of creating accurate and detailed 3D models for engineering applications.",1
"Vision-language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to navigate step-by-step while perceiving the visual observations and comprehending a natural language instruction. Large data bias, which is caused by the disparity ratio between the small data scale and large navigation space, makes the VLN task challenging. Previous works have proposed various data augmentation methods to reduce data bias. However, these works do not explicitly reduce the data bias across different house scenes. Therefore, the agent would overfit to the seen scenes and achieve poor navigation performance in the unseen scenes. To tackle this problem, we propose the Random Environmental Mixup (REM) method, which generates cross-connected house scenes as augmented data via mixuping environment. Specifically, we first select key viewpoints according to the room connection graph for each scene. Then, we cross-connect the key views of different scenes to construct augmented scenes. Finally, we generate augmented instruction-path pairs in the cross-connected scenes. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our augmentation data via REM help the agent reduce its performance gap between the seen and unseen environment and improve the overall performance, making our model the best existing approach on the standard VLN benchmark.",0
"This is an abstract for a research paper on developing artificial intelligence algorithms that can navigate through different environments using visual inputs and natural language commands from humans. The proposed approach mixes up randomly selected environmental factors, such as lighting conditions and object appearances, to train the algorithm so that it can better handle real-world variations. Experiments show improved performance compared to traditional methods without randomization, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

"Image caption generation is one of the most challenging problems at the intersection of visual recognition and natural language modeling domains. In this work, we propose and study a practically important variant of this problem where test images may contain visual objects with no corresponding visual or textual training examples. For this problem, we propose a detection-driven approach based on a generalized zero-shot detection model and a template-based sentence generation model. In order to improve the detection component, we jointly define a class-to-class similarity based class representation and a practical score calibration mechanism. We also propose a novel evaluation metric that provides complimentary insights to the captioning outputs, by separately handling the visual and non-visual components of the captions. Our experiments show that the proposed zero-shot detection model obtains state-of-the-art performance on the MS-COCO dataset and the zero-shot captioning approach yields promising results.",0
"Detecting objects from images is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision, which has applications ranging from autonomous robots to content based image retrieval systems. Most existing works have been focusing on detectors that can handle common object classes such as cars, dogs, cats, etc., but there still remain a large number of uncommon or rare objects, e.g., animals living only in remote areas, plants specific to certain regions, newly designed vehicles or gadgets, etc. As we want our detection models to work well on all kinds of objects without additional training data for each category, we need ways to deal with unseen objects automatically during testing time. In this paper, instead of proposing another detector architecture like YOLOv8 or Tiny-DSOD, we concentrate on exploring several post-processing techniques to tackle this problem. Specifically: (a) We create “chimeric” datasets by fusing objects across different images into single examples with new identities (e.g., cat + dog = chimera). This method simulates arbitrary combinations of unseen objects, leading to improved generalization ability. (b) During inference, we apply a conditional prior network to infer object properties before classification. By doing so, ambiguity is reduced and detection accuracy increases, especially under low confidence scores caused by poor representations in feature maps. Besides boosting base performance via these components, our overall system outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both COCO and VOC benchmarks using less computation budget than them on similar backbones. To further evaluate generalizability over novel categories, we introduce Stuff-Inception where we feed randomly cropped sub-regions (instead of full images) to pretrained models to observe if they can generate satisfactory captions fo",1
"Transformer, first applied to the field of natural language processing, is a type of deep neural network mainly based on the self-attention mechanism. Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Given its high performance and less need for vision-specific inductive bias, transformer is receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this paper, we review these vision transformer models by categorizing them in different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision, low-level vision, and video processing. We also include efficient transformer methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications. Furthermore, we also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer.

"Recently proposed fine-grained 3D visual grounding is an essential and challenging task, whose goal is to identify the 3D object referred by a natural language sentence from other distractive objects of the same category. Existing works usually adopt dynamic graph networks to indirectly model the intra/inter-modal interactions, making the model difficult to distinguish the referred object from distractors due to the monolithic representations of visual and linguistic contents. In this work, we exploit Transformer for its natural suitability on permutation-invariant 3D point clouds data and propose a TransRefer3D network to extract entity-and-relation aware multimodal context among objects for more discriminative feature learning. Concretely, we devise an Entity-aware Attention (EA) module and a Relation-aware Attention (RA) module to conduct fine-grained cross-modal feature matching. Facilitated by co-attention operation, our EA module matches visual entity features with linguistic entity features while RA module matches pair-wise visual relation features with linguistic relation features, respectively. We further integrate EA and RA modules into an Entity-and-Relation aware Contextual Block (ERCB) and stack several ERCBs to form our TransRefer3D for hierarchical multimodal context modeling. Extensive experiments on both Nr3D and Sr3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing approaches by up to 10.6% and claims the new state-of-the-art. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating Transformer architecture for fine-grained 3D visual grounding task.",0
"This paper presents a novel transformer model called ""TransRefer3D"" that addresses fine-grained visual grounding tasks by explicitly modeling entity relationships within a scene. In contrast to previous approaches which only focus on referring expressions within a single image, our approach models cross-modal dependencies between language queries and spatial entities across multiple images. Our method uses multi-head attention to weight different contextual views of referential expressions, allowing for better disambiguation of ambiguous references. Experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach for fine-grained 3D visual grounding.",1
"Video captioning aims to automatically generate natural language sentences that can describe the visual contents of a given video. Existing generative models like encoder-decoder frameworks cannot explicitly explore the object-level interactions and frame-level information from complex spatio-temporal data to generate semantic-rich captions. Our main contribution is to identify three key problems in a joint framework for future video summarization tasks. 1) Enhanced Object Proposal: we propose a novel Conditional Graph that can fuse spatio-temporal information into latent object proposal. 2) Visual Knowledge: Latent Proposal Aggregation is proposed to dynamically extract visual words with higher semantic levels. 3) Sentence Validation: A novel Discriminative Language Validator is proposed to verify generated captions so that key semantic concepts can be effectively preserved. Our experiments on two public datasets (MVSD and MSR-VTT) manifest significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on all metrics, especially for BLEU-4 and CIDEr.

"Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can handle tabular data, images, text, and audio as both input and output.

"We extend the task of composed image retrieval, where an input query consists of an image and short textual description of how to modify the image. Existing methods have only been applied to non-complex images within narrow domains, such as fashion products, thereby limiting the scope of study on in-depth visual reasoning in rich image and language contexts. To address this issue, we collect the Compose Image Retrieval on Real-life images (CIRR) dataset, which consists of over 36,000 pairs of crowd-sourced, open-domain images with human-generated modifying text. To extend current methods to the open-domain, we propose CIRPLANT, a transformer based model that leverages rich pre-trained vision-and-language (V&L) knowledge for modifying visual features conditioned on natural language. Retrieval is then done by nearest neighbor lookup on the modified features. We demonstrate that with a relatively simple architecture, CIRPLANT outperforms existing methods on open-domain images, while matching state-of-the-art accuracy on the existing narrow datasets, such as fashion. Together with the release of CIRR, we believe this work will inspire further research on composed image retrieval.",0

"Video-and-Language Inference is a recently proposed task for joint video-and-language understanding. This new task requires a model to draw inference on whether a natural language statement entails or contradicts a given video clip. In this paper, we study how to address three critical challenges for this task: judging the global correctness of the statement involved multiple semantic meanings, joint reasoning over video and subtitles, and modeling long-range relationships and complex social interactions. First, we propose an adaptive hierarchical graph network that achieves in-depth understanding of the video over complex interactions. Specifically, it performs joint reasoning over video and subtitles in three hierarchies, where the graph structure is adaptively adjusted according to the semantic structures of the statement. Secondly, we introduce semantic coherence learning to explicitly encourage the semantic coherence of the adaptive hierarchical graph network from three hierarchies. The semantic coherence learning can further improve the alignment between vision and linguistics, and the coherence across a sequence of video segments. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline by a large margin.",0
"This abstract describes how semantic coherence can be used to improve video-and-language inference by using adaptive hierarchical graph reasoning (AHGR). AHGR is a method that combines bottom-up and top-down processing to build meaningful representations from raw data such as video frames or textual descriptions. By incorporating semantic coherence into AHGR, we can more effectively identify relationships between different elements within the video and language inputs, leading to more accurate inferences across both modalities. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on two challenging datasets: TVQA and MovieQA. Our results demonstrate that our AHGR model outperforms several strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method.",1
"To continuously improve quality and reflect changes in data, machine learning applications have to regularly retrain and update their core models. We show that a differential analysis of language model snapshots before and after an update can reveal a surprising amount of detailed information about changes in the training data. We propose two new metrics---\emph{differential score} and \emph{differential rank}---for analyzing the leakage due to updates of natural language models. We perform leakage analysis using these metrics across models trained on several different datasets using different methods and configurations. We discuss the privacy implications of our findings, propose mitigation strategies and evaluate their effect.",0
"This paper examines how natural language models can leak sensitive data through their updates. Despite recent advances in privacy regulations such as GDPR, there remains little understanding of the potential vulnerabilities introduced by these systems. Through empirical analysis on popular NLP datasets, we demonstrate that updates made to pretrained models can unintentionally reveal information about the users who contributed training examples, including personal characteristics and potentially even their identities. These findings highlight the need for more stringent controls over the use of large-scale machine learning datasets and suggest future research directions aimed at minimizing unwanted information leakage from model updates without sacrificing performance.",1
"Recently, there have been breakthroughs in computer vision (""CV"") models that are more generalizable with the advent of models such as CLIP and ALIGN. In this paper, we analyze CLIP and highlight some of the challenges such models pose. CLIP reduces the need for task specific training data, potentially opening up many niche tasks to automation. CLIP also allows its users to flexibly specify image classification classes in natural language, which we find can shift how biases manifest. Additionally, through some preliminary probes we find that CLIP can inherit biases found in prior computer vision systems. Given the wide and unpredictable domain of uses for such models, this raises questions regarding what sufficiently safe behaviour for such systems may look like. These results add evidence to the growing body of work calling for a change in the notion of a 'better' model--to move beyond simply looking at higher accuracy at task-oriented capability evaluations, and towards a broader 'better' that takes into account deployment-critical features such as different use contexts, and people who interact with the model when thinking about model deployment.",0
"""This research seeks to evaluate Clip (Contrastive Langevin Inference Pipeline) which is one of the most powerful generative models on human generated data yet created, however while some have investigated how well it works none have examined what it can do beyond making images or even if those images are accurate representations. Our analysis shows that although there is significant uncertainty in Clip predictions we can still classify them as more likely correct than incorrect. We also find that images made by clip lack many common features found in real world objects, such as depth or specular reflections from metallic materials and plastic lenses. Lastly our work establishes methods capable of evaluating other GANs against clip using a consistent metric.""",1
"In many sequence learning tasks, such as program synthesis and document summarization, a key problem is searching over a large space of possible output sequences. We propose to learn representations of the outputs that are specifically meant for search: rich enough to specify the desired output but compact enough to make search more efficient. Discrete latent codes are appealing for this purpose, as they naturally allow sophisticated combinatorial search strategies. The latent codes are learned using a self-supervised learning principle, in which first a discrete autoencoder is trained on the output sequences, and then the resulting latent codes are used as intermediate targets for the end-to-end sequence prediction task. Based on these insights, we introduce the \emph{Latent Programmer}, a program synthesis method that first predicts a discrete latent code from input/output examples, and then generates the program in the target language. We evaluate the Latent Programmer on two domains: synthesis of string transformation programs, and generation of programs from natural language descriptions. We demonstrate that the discrete latent representation significantly improves synthesis accuracy.",0
"Abstract: In the field of program synthesis, finding efficient solutions that satisfy complex specifications remains a challenging task. One approach towards solving this problem involves learning a latent representation of code using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, most current methods suffer from several limitations such as high computational cost, poor scalability, and limited expressiveness of the learned representations. To address these issues, we propose a new method called ""Latent Programmer"" which leverages discrete latent codes to represent programs, allowing us to learn more concise and interpretable models while significantly reducing computation time and memory usage. Our experimental results on multiple programming tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art techniques, achieving better performance while requiring fewer resources. This work opens up exciting opportunities for improving existing software development practices by enabling developers to leverage machine learning algorithms to automatically generate high-quality code.

"Inspired by how the human brain employs a higher number of neural pathways when describing a highly focused subject, we show that deep attentive models used for the main vision-language task of image captioning, could be extended to achieve better performance. Image captioning bridges a gap between computer vision and natural language processing. Automated image captioning is used as a tool to eliminate the need for human agent for creating descriptive captions for unseen images.Automated image captioning is challenging and yet interesting. One reason is that AI based systems capable of generating sentences that describe an input image could be used in a wide variety of tasks beyond generating captions for unseen images found on web or uploaded to social media. For example, in biology and medical sciences, these systems could provide researchers and physicians with a brief linguistic description of relevant images, potentially expediting their work.",0
"This abstract provides a brief overview of two approaches to natural language processing (NLP) that have shown promising results: Neural Twins and alternative calculations. Both methods aim to improve NLP by enhancing the understanding and generation of human-like responses. The Neural Twins approach involves training multiple models on different subsets of data so they can better capture the variability inherent in human language. These trained models then work together as ""twins"" to solve complex tasks. On the other hand, alternative calculation techniques focus more explicitly on reasoning and planning and try to model both linguistically-specific and world knowledge within a single system. They involve designing architectures where there are separate modules responsible for each component of computation but all working closely together as one network. By combining these distinct approaches, researchers hope to achieve even greater advancements in the field of NLP.",1
"While convolutional neural networks have shown a tremendous impact on various computer vision tasks, they generally demonstrate limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependencies due to the intrinsic locality of the convolution operation. Initially designed for natural language processing tasks, Transformers have emerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose TransDepth, an architecture that benefits from both convolutional neural networks and transformers. To avoid the network losing its ability to capture local-level details due to the adoption of transformers, we propose a novel decoder that employs attention mechanisms based on gates. Notably, this is the first paper that applies transformers to pixel-wise prediction problems involving continuous labels (i.e., monocular depth prediction and surface normal estimation). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TransDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets.

"Neural agents trained in reinforcement learning settings can learn to communicate among themselves via discrete tokens, accomplishing as a team what agents would be unable to do alone. However, the current standard of using one-hot vectors as discrete communication tokens prevents agents from acquiring more desirable aspects of communication such as zero-shot understanding. Inspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we propose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via discrete tokens derived from a learned, continuous space. We show in a decision theoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide range of scenarios, whereas one-hot tokens are only optimal under restrictive assumptions. In self-play experiments, we validate that our trained agents learn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them communicate in noisy environments where other techniques fail. Lastly, we demonstrate both that agents using our method can effectively respond to novel human communication and that humans can understand unlabeled emergent agent communication, outperforming the use of one-hot communication.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how discrete representations can emerge from distributed neural networks. This paper presents a novel approach to studying this phenomenon by examining the relationship between semantic spaces and communication dynamics. Our results show that as agents interact in these semantic spaces, they form a shared representation that allows them to communicate more effectively. Furthermore, we find that this emergent representation is discrete rather than continuous, challenging previous assumptions about how neural networks process information. These findings have important implications for our understanding of cognitive processes such as language acquisition and social learning.

"Meter-level load forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management and power system planning for Smart Grids (SGs), in tasks associated with regulation, dispatching, scheduling, and unit commitment of power grids. Although a variety of algorithms have been proposed and applied on the field, more accurate and robust models are still required: the overall utility cost of operations in SGs increases 10 million currency units if the load forecasting error increases 1%, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in forecasting is still much higher than 1%.

"Deep learning on graphs has attracted significant interests recently. However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness.

"Progress of machine learning in critical care has been difficult to track, in part due to absence of public benchmarks. Other fields of research (such as computer vision and natural language processing) have established various competitions and public benchmarks. Recent availability of large clinical datasets has enabled the possibility of establishing public benchmarks. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we propose a public benchmark suite to address four areas of critical care, namely mortality prediction, estimation of length of stay, patient phenotyping and risk of decompensation. We define each task and compare the performance of both clinical models as well as baseline and deep learning models using eICU critical care dataset of around 73,000 patients. This is the first public benchmark on a multi-centre critical care dataset, comparing the performance of clinical gold standard with our predictive model.

"Machine Learning (ML) has been increasingly used in healthcare domains such as critical care to improve patient outcomes by predicting potential adverse events, mortality risk assessment, and optimizing treatment plans. In recent years, the availability of large electronic intensive care unit (eICU) datasets across multiple centers has enabled researchers to benchmark their ML models against standard clinical practices. However, comparing different eICU ML models can be challenging due to variations in data quality, feature engineering methods, model architectures, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. Therefore, establishing comprehensive benchmarks using multicenter eICU data plays a crucial role in advancing knowledge in the field of critical care informatics and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to design rigorous methodologies for evaluating and benchmarking eICU ML models developed from diverse eICU datasets across different hospitals worldwide. Our approach involved developing standardized feature extraction pipelines, harmonization techniques, and robust evaluation protocols that were validated through cross-validation experiments involving multiple eICU datasets.

"Interventional causal models describe several joint distributions over some variables used to describe a system, one for each intervention setting. They provide a formal recipe for how to move between the different joint distributions and make predictions about the variables upon intervening on the system. Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying variables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M' and then further simplifying that to obtain M'', we expect the composite transformation from M to M'' to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual transformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects via compositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to develop our framework for model transformations and abstractions. We introduce a category of finite interventional causal models and, leveraging theory of enriched categories, prove the desired compositionality properties for our framework.",0

"Video captioning is an essential technology to understand scenes and describe events in natural language. To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs not only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon as possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality, but this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing based on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual Trans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small portion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer to which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained to detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two Trans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained Transformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages of an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be forecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our approach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the pre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames from the beginning.",0
"This abstract aims to describe a new method for optimizing latency in online video captioning using audio-visual transformers (AVTs). With the increasing popularity of streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube, there has been a growing demand for real-time captions that can keep up with live broadcasts. However, current methods for generating captions often result in high latencies due to their reliance on complex model architectures and data processing steps. Our approach addresses these issues by leveraging AVTs, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving audio and visual signals. By integrating an attention mechanism into our framework, we enable the models to focus on relevant segments of the input audio stream and generate more accurate predictions. Additionally, we show that incorporating spatial features derived from frames helps further reduce latency without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over existing systems across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining low latencies.

"Most existing neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms are dedicated to the downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However, extensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as ResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are generally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on different downstream tasks. These observations inspire us to ask: Is it necessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and search for good neural architectures? Can we perform NAS effectively and efficiently while being agnostic to the downstream task? In this work, we attempt to affirmatively answer the above two questions and improve the state-of-the-art NAS solution by proposing a novel and generic NAS framework, termed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but instead adopts \textit{regression} on a set of manually designed synthetic signal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression task can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture and transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of training samples. We then propose an automatic task search to optimize the combination of synthetic signals using limited downstream-task-specific labels, further improving the performance of GenNAS. We also thoroughly evaluate GenNAS's generality and end-to-end NAS performance on all search spaces, which outperforms almost all existing works with significant speedup.",0
"In neural architecture search (NAS), evaluating many models can become computationally expensive since they must be trained from scratch every time. Recent work has used transfer learning to amortize NAS evaluation cost by reusing pretrained weights; however, these methods still suffer from computational overhead due to the need to fine-tune all architectures on each dataset separately. We introduce GenericNeuroarXiv, a method that uses regression to predict accuracy directly without training any model at all. Our approach requires fewer than four GPU hours per dataset, is faster than previous nonlinear meta learners, does not assume access to any pretraining data, and outperforms other NAS baselines across seven benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show how our approach can even handle more challenging scenarios such as one-shot NAS, where only a single query is made to evaluate an entire distribution of architectures. Code will be released upon acceptance.",1
"Attention-based transformer networks have demonstrated promising potential as their applications extend from natural language processing to vision. However, despite the recent improvements, such as sub-quadratic attention approximation and various training enhancements, the compact vision transformers to date using the regular attention still fall short in comparison with its convnet counterparts, in terms of \textit{accuracy,} \textit{model size}, \textit{and} \textit{throughput}. This paper introduces a compact self-attention mechanism that is fundamental and highly generalizable. The proposed method reduces redundancy and improves efficiency on top of the existing attention optimizations. We show its drop-in applicability for both the regular attention mechanism and some most recent variants in vision transformers. As a result, we produced smaller and faster models with the same or better accuracies.",0
"In recent years, transformer architectures have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by providing state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. However, these models often suffer from high computational complexity due to their attention mechanism, making them impractical for many real-world applications such as image classification, object detection, and video analysis that require efficient computation times. To overcome this challenge, we propose Armour, which combines novel design choices aimed at reducing the quadratic scaling of self-attention with a new lightweight convolutional layer variant. Our approach significantly improves efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy across several vision tasks compared against strong baselines like ViT, DeiT, T2T-ViT, CoaT, and StreamTransformer. Additionally, our model offers better scalability with respect to sequence length, enabling potential use cases beyond typical sequence data like images, videos, and graph-structured inputs where local dependencies play an important role. We hope our work opens doors towards developing more powerful yet faster attention mechanisms suitable for broader adoption in machine learning practice beyond textual domains.",1
"Deep learning has achieved great success in a wide spectrum of multimedia applications such as image classification, natural language processing and multimodal data analysis. Recent years have seen the development of many deep learning frameworks that provide a high-level programming interface for users to design models, conduct training and deploy inference. However, it remains challenging to build an efficient end-to-end multimedia application with most existing frameworks. Specifically, in terms of usability, it is demanding for non-experts to implement deep learning models, obtain the right settings for the entire machine learning pipeline, manage models and datasets, and exploit external data sources all together. Further, in terms of adaptability, elastic computation solutions are much needed as the actual serving workload fluctuates constantly, and scaling the hardware resources to handle the fluctuating workload is typically infeasible. To address these challenges, we introduce SINGA-Easy, a new deep learning framework that provides distributed hyper-parameter tuning at the training stage, dynamic computational cost control at the inference stage, and intuitive user interactions with multimedia contents facilitated by model explanation. Our experiments on the training and deployment of multi-modality data analysis applications show that the framework is both usable and adaptable to dynamic inference loads. We implement SINGA-Easy on top of Apache SINGA and demonstrate our system with the entire machine learning life cycle.",0
"Title: ""SINGA-Easy: A Framework for MultiModal Analysis""  Abstract: This paper presents SINGA-Easy, a framework designed specifically for multi-modal analysis that offers easy integration and use for researchers across various domains. The proposed approach addresses some of the challenges posed by current state-of-the-art tools such as limited scalability, high computational demands, and difficulty integrating new modalities into existing workflows. By leveraging the power of the fastai library along with a modular architecture, we aim to provide a versatile solution suitable for both experts and novices alike. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through multiple case studies spanning different modalities such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), robotics, among others. Our results show significant improvements over baseline methods on standard benchmark datasets while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. Overall, SINGA-Easy has immense potential for advancing research in the multimodal domain, providing practitioners with a one-stop shop for their analytical needs.",1
"The recently-proposed Perceiver model obtains good results on several domains (images, audio, multimodal, point clouds) while scaling linearly in compute and memory with the input size. While the Perceiver supports many kinds of inputs, it can only produce very simple outputs such as class scores. Perceiver IO overcomes this limitation without sacrificing the original's appealing properties by learning to flexibly query the model's latent space to produce outputs of arbitrary size and semantics. Perceiver IO still decouples model depth from data size and still scales linearly with data size, but now with respect to both input and output sizes. The full Perceiver IO model achieves strong results on tasks with highly structured output spaces, such as natural language and visual understanding, StarCraft II, and multi-task and multi-modal domains. As highlights, Perceiver IO matches a Transformer-based BERT baseline on the GLUE language benchmark without the need for input tokenization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel optical flow estimation.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in many domains by leveraging large amounts of data and powerful model architectures. However, one key challenge remains: creating models that can generate meaningful outputs given structured inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Perceiver IO, a general architecture designed for processing structured inputs and producing structured outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. Our results show that Perceiver IO outperforms state-of-the-art methods while offering greater flexibility and interpretability. This work has important implications for natural language processing research, as well as practical applications across industries.",1
"Can a generative model be trained to produce images from a specific domain, guided by a text prompt only, without seeing any image? In other words: can an image generator be trained blindly? Leveraging the semantic power of large scale Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training (CLIP) models, we present a text-driven method that allows shifting a generative model to new domains, without having to collect even a single image from those domains. We show that through natural language prompts and a few minutes of training, our method can adapt a generator across a multitude of domains characterized by diverse styles and shapes. Notably, many of these modifications would be difficult or outright impossible to reach with existing methods. We conduct an extensive set of experiments and comparisons across a wide range of domains. These demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our shifted models maintain the latent-space properties that make generative models appealing for downstream tasks.",0
"This work focuses on domain adaptation for image generators using a novel technique called ""CLIP-guidance"". We explore the effectiveness of utilizing external guidance from CLIP (Contrastive Language Pretrained Model) embeddings as regularization signals during training for improved performance across different domains. By guiding the generator towards CLIP-consistent outputs, we can improve generalizability while maintaining high visual quality. Our experiments demonstrate that our method leads to state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets under both quantitative evaluation metrics and qualitative human assessments. Overall, this work provides new insights into effective domain adaptation techniques and their impacts on image generation tasks.",1
"Human-in-the-loop aims to train an accurate prediction model with minimum cost by integrating human knowledge and experience. Humans can provide training data for machine learning applications and directly accomplish some tasks that are hard for computers in the pipeline with the help of machine-based approaches. In this paper, we survey existing works on human-in-the-loop from a data perspective and classify them into three categories with a progressive relationship: (1) the work of improving model performance from data processing, (2) the work of improving model performance through interventional model training, and (3) the design of the system independent human-in-the-loop. Using the above categorization, we summarize major approaches in the field, along with their technical strengths/ weaknesses, we have simple classification and discussion in natural language processing, computer vision, and others. Besides, we provide some open challenges and opportunities. This survey intends to provide a high-level summarization for human-in-the-loop and motivates interested readers to consider approaches for designing effective human-in-the-loop solutions.",0
"This survey papers reviews recent developments in human-machine collaboration, discussing how machine learning (ML) models can benefit from interacting with human decision makers. In order to achieve good results on real-world problems, ML systems must make decisions based on vast amounts of data that they collect over time. Although these algorithms may yield very precise recommendations and predictions by themselves, incorporating human feedback at different stages of their design and use leads to more accurate outcomes overall. Furthermore, involving humans throughout the training process improves model interpretability, ensures fairness, reduces risk, and enhances trust. By leveraging human judgment as well as automation, ML applications gain in scalability and robustness, ultimately producing better outcomes in less time. Thus, we conclude that there exists immense potential in cooperative efforts among machines and human agents, provided these interactions are designed thoughtfully and ethically.",1
"Learning continuously during all model lifetime is fundamental to deploy machine learning solutions robust to drifts in the data distribution. Advances in Continual Learning (CL) with recurrent neural networks could pave the way to a large number of applications where incoming data is non stationary, like natural language processing and robotics. However, the existing body of work on the topic is still fragmented, with approaches which are application-specific and whose assessment is based on heterogeneous learning protocols and datasets. In this paper, we organize the literature on CL for sequential data processing by providing a categorization of the contributions and a review of the benchmarks. We propose two new benchmarks for CL with sequential data based on existing datasets, whose characteristics resemble real-world applications. We also provide a broad empirical evaluation of CL and Recurrent Neural Networks in class-incremental scenario, by testing their ability to mitigate forgetting with a number of different strategies which are not specific to sequential data processing. Our results highlight the key role played by the sequence length and the importance of a clear specification of the CL scenario.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have become increasingly popular due to their ability to learn from large amounts of data. One such technique that has gained significant attention is recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs are capable of processing sequential data and have been successfully applied to a variety of tasks including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction. However, training these models can be computationally expensive and often requires specialized hardware. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called continual learning for RNNs which allows them to adapt incrementally without retraining on the entire dataset. We evaluate our method using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly less computational resources compared to traditional RNN methods. Our results indicate that continual learning for RNNs represents a promising new direction for improving their efficiency and scalability.",1
"""How can we animate 3D-characters from a movie script or move robots by simply telling them what we would like them to do?"" ""How unstructured and complex can we make a sentence and still generate plausible movements from it?"" These are questions that need to be answered in the long-run, as the field is still in its infancy. Inspired by these problems, we present a new technique for generating compositional actions, which handles complex input sentences. Our output is a 3D pose sequence depicting the actions in the input sentence. We propose a hierarchical two-stream sequential model to explore a finer joint-level mapping between natural language sentences and 3D pose sequences corresponding to the given motion. We learn two manifold representations of the motion -- one each for the upper body and the lower body movements. Our model can generate plausible pose sequences for short sentences describing single actions as well as long compositional sentences describing multiple sequential and superimposed actions. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available KIT Motion-Language Dataset containing 3D pose data with human-annotated sentences. Experimental results show that our model advances the state-of-the-art on text-based motion synthesis in objective evaluations by a margin of 50%. Qualitative evaluations based on a user study indicate that our synthesized motions are perceived to be the closest to the ground-truth motion captures for both short and compositional sentences.",0
"This paper presents a method for synthesizing animations directly from natural language descriptions using deep learning techniques. Our system uses a generative model trained on large amounts of animation data to predict the next frame given a text description of the current one. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our method can generate plausible images and videos even when trained without ground truth alignment data. Furthermore, we show that our system can generalize well across different domains and styles, producing results comparable to those obtained by hand-crafted systems. Finally, we explore applications of our technique, such as generating novel animations from summaries and enabling non-experts to create animations easily through written input alone.",1
"Despite the progress in automatic detection of radiologic findings from chest X-ray (CXR) images in recent years, a quantitative evaluation of the explainability of these models is hampered by the lack of locally labeled datasets for different findings. With the exception of a few expert-labeled small-scale datasets for specific findings, such as pneumonia and pneumothorax, most of the CXR deep learning models to date are trained on global ""weak"" labels extracted from text reports, or trained via a joint image and unstructured text learning strategy. Inspired by the Visual Genome effort in the computer vision community, we constructed the first Chest ImaGenome dataset with a scene graph data structure to describe $242,072$ images. Local annotations are automatically produced using a joint rule-based natural language processing (NLP) and atlas-based bounding box detection pipeline. Through a radiologist constructed CXR ontology, the annotations for each CXR are connected as an anatomy-centered scene graph, useful for image-level reasoning and multimodal fusion applications. Overall, we provide: i) $1,256$ combinations of relation annotations between $29$ CXR anatomical locations (objects with bounding box coordinates) and their attributes, structured as a scene graph per image, ii) over $670,000$ localized comparison relations (for improved, worsened, or no change) between the anatomical locations across sequential exams, as well as ii) a manually annotated gold standard scene graph dataset from $500$ unique patients.",0
"""The lack of large radiographic image datasets has been a significant barrier to developing deep learning models that can reliably detect diseases from chest x-rays (CXR). To address this issue, we present the largest publicly available CXR dataset with annotated pathologies to date – the Imagenet Medical Image Collection (Imagenet), which contains over 8 million images. In this study, we focus on the subset of the collection containing frontal-view adult human chest x-rays, which includes 267,498 unique exams. This subset, called the Chest ImaGenome Dataset (ChID) represents an order of magnitude more data than all previously published datasets combined. We provide detailed descriptions of the imaging techniques utilized along with demographics and important metadata such as age, sex, smoking status and any known drug reactions that may impact the interpretation of lung disease patterns seen within the x-rays themselves. Given the amount of pathology seen in this dataset, our work could potentially lead to improvements in deep learning-based diagnostic decision support tools that perform competitively against board certified radiologists.""",1
"Connecting Vision and Language plays an essential role in Generative Intelligence. For this reason, large research efforts have been devoted to image captioning, i.e. describing images with syntactically and semantically meaningful sentences. Starting from 2015 the task has generally been addressed with pipelines composed of a visual encoder and a language model for text generation. During these years, both components have evolved considerably through the exploitation of object regions, attributes, the introduction of multi-modal connections, fully-attentive approaches, and BERT-like early-fusion strategies. However, regardless of the impressive results, research in image captioning has not reached a conclusive answer yet. This work aims at providing a comprehensive overview of image captioning approaches, from visual encoding and text generation to training strategies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this respect, we quantitatively compare many relevant state-of-the-art approaches to identify the most impactful technical innovations in architectures and training strategies. Moreover, many variants of the problem and its open challenges are discussed. The final goal of this work is to serve as a tool for understanding the existing literature and highlighting the future directions for a research area where Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing can find an optimal synergy.",0
"This should be an overview of your research results without giving away the conclusion. The survey investigates different methods that have been developed for image caption generation by analyzing a number of state-of-the-art papers from top conferences and journals. By comparing these approaches we aimed to identify which techniques work best across both quantitative metrics as well as human evaluation. We identified two main categories of recent works - those that focus on describing images via natural language descriptions (Show), and those that extract salient features using visual representations to generate captions directly from raw pixels (Tell). Our analysis shows that while some hybrid models can outperform simpler baselines, there exists no universal champion method capable of consistently producing high quality captions. Given the wide variety of tasks evaluated during our study, the fact remains that all current algorithms still fall short relative to the capability of humans who consistently provide superior captions. Ultimately it may require fundamentally new advances in areas such as computer vision, deep learning, natural language processing, cognitive psychology and more before machines can truly match humans at image captioning.",1
"Gradient quantization is an emerging technique in reducing communication costs in distributed learning. Existing gradient quantization algorithms often rely on engineering heuristics or empirical observations, lacking a systematic approach to dynamically quantize gradients. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel dynamically quantized SGD (DQ-SGD) framework, enabling us to dynamically adjust the quantization scheme for each gradient descent step by exploring the trade-off between communication cost and convergence error. We derive an upper bound, tight in some cases, of the convergence error for a restricted family of quantization schemes and loss functions. We design our DQ-SGD algorithm via minimizing the communication cost under the convergence error constraints. Finally, through extensive experiments on large-scale natural language processing and computer vision tasks on AG-News, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, we demonstrate that our quantization scheme achieves better tradeoffs between the communication cost and learning performance than other state-of-the-art gradient quantization methods.",0
"Here we present DQ-SGD, a novel method that leverages dynamic quantization during distributed training to reduce communication overhead while maintaining high model accuracy. Traditional distributed learning approaches rely on gradient compression techniques such as quantization to balance limited bandwidth resources with increasingly larger datasets. However, these methods often struggle to find a suitable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy due to their static nature. By introducing dynamic quantization into the equation, our proposed algorithm can adaptively adjust the level of precision necessary at each stage of training, striking a more effective balance overall. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DQ-SGD compared to other state-of-the-art strategies across multiple applications, including image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. With this approach, practitioners can enjoy the benefits of faster and cheaper distributed learning without sacrificing model quality. Overall, DQ-SGD represents a significant step forward in enabling wider adoption of large-scale machine learning models by addressing one of the key challenges facing modern deep learning research - efficient communication amid growing dataset sizes.",1
"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task in which an agent needs to follow a language-specified path to reach a target destination. The goal gets even harder as the actions available to the agent get simpler and move towards low-level, atomic interactions with the environment. This setting takes the name of low-level VLN. In this paper, we strive for the creation of an agent able to tackle three key issues: multi-modality, long-term dependencies, and adaptability towards different locomotive settings. To that end, we devise ""Perceive, Transform, and Act"" (PTA): a fully-attentive VLN architecture that leaves the recurrent approach behind and the first Transformer-like architecture incorporating three different modalities - natural language, images, and low-level actions for the agent control. In particular, we adopt an early fusion strategy to merge lingual and visual information efficiently in our encoder. We then propose to refine the decoding phase with a late fusion extension between the agent's history of actions and the perceptual modalities. We experimentally validate our model on two datasets: PTA achieves promising results in low-level VLN on R2R and achieves good performance in the recently proposed R4R benchmark. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/perceive-transform-and-act.",0
"In recent years, advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image classification. However, despite these accomplishments, there remains a large gap between state-of-the-art models trained on specific modalities (e.g., vision only) and more generalizable human level intelligence which can perform well across multiple sensory inputs simultaneously. This paper addresses that issue by proposing novel neural network architectures capable of seamlessly integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. To achieve this goal, we introduce multimodal attention networks, whose core component consists of dynamic weighted connections between different streams of data, allowing them to adaptively attend to relevant features at each moment in time. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on challenging real world navigation scenarios, that our approach outperforms existing methods by achieving unprecedented performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our results suggest the potential of using multimodal representations for developing advanced artificial intelligence systems which can effectively interact with their surroundings under highly uncertain conditions.",1
"Relative position encoding (RPE) is important for transformer to capture sequence ordering of input tokens. General efficacy has been proven in natural language processing. However, in computer vision, its efficacy is not well studied and even remains controversial, e.g., whether relative position encoding can work equally well as absolute position? In order to clarify this, we first review existing relative position encoding methods and analyze their pros and cons when applied in vision transformers. We then propose new relative position encoding methods dedicated to 2D images, called image RPE (iRPE). Our methods consider directional relative distance modeling as well as the interactions between queries and relative position embeddings in self-attention mechanism. The proposed iRPE methods are simple and lightweight. They can be easily plugged into transformer blocks. Experiments demonstrate that solely due to the proposed encoding methods, DeiT and DETR obtain up to 1.5% (top-1 Acc) and 1.3% (mAP) stable improvements over their original versions on ImageNet and COCO respectively, without tuning any extra hyperparameters such as learning rate and weight decay. Our ablation and analysis also yield interesting findings, some of which run counter to previous understanding. Code and models are open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/Cream/tree/main/iRPE.",0
"This paper proposes novel approaches to relative position encoding (RPE) that improve performance on visual transformer models compared to previous methods.

Our method improves performance across various benchmark datasets while maintaining competitive computational costs. Furthermore, we provide detailed analyses of our model’s behavior by performing extensive studies to demonstrate its effectiveness. These findings contribute significant advancements towards understanding and utilizing efficient relative position encoders in vision transformers. Overall, the contributions of this work broaden our knowledge base regarding how relative positions can influence the learning process within transformers, enabling more informed future research.",1
"Compared with the visual grounding on 2D images, the natural-language-guided 3D object localization on point clouds is more challenging. In this paper, we propose a new model, named InstanceRefer, to achieve a superior 3D visual grounding through the grounding-by-matching strategy. In practice, our model first predicts the target category from the language descriptions using a simple language classification model. Then, based on the category, our model sifts out a small number of instance candidates (usually less than 20) from the panoptic segmentation of point clouds. Thus, the non-trivial 3D visual grounding task has been effectively re-formulated as a simplified instance-matching problem, considering that instance-level candidates are more rational than the redundant 3D object proposals. Subsequently, for each candidate, we perform the multi-level contextual inference, i.e., referring from instance attribute perception, instance-to-instance relation perception, and instance-to-background global localization perception, respectively. Eventually, the most relevant candidate is selected and localized by ranking confidence scores, which are obtained by the cooperative holistic visual-language feature matching. Experiments confirm that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on ScanRefer online benchmark and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets.",0
"This work presents a cooperative holistic understanding approach towards visual grounding on point clouds using instance multi-level contextual referring (InstanceRefer). With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology and robotics, there has been increasing interest in real-time semantic segmentation and object detection from 3D LiDAR scans. However, current methods face significant challenges due to the high variability present in point cloud data caused by factors such as viewpoint changes, occlusions, and different sensor configurations. To address these issues, our proposed method utilizes multi-scale context information provided by instance-based object representations to enhance local feature extraction and grouping. We then use a global context module based on graph convolutional networks to refine initial predictions and aggregate results across multiple levels of abstraction. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and speed, while also providing explainability via attention maps generated at each stage of reasoning. Our study provides important insights into improving the robustness and flexibility of existing models for accurate scene analysis under complex conditions.",1
"Video generation is one of the most challenging tasks in Machine Learning and Computer Vision fields of study. In this paper, we tackle the text to video generation problem, which is a conditional form of video generation. Humans can listen/read natural language sentences, and can imagine or visualize what is being described; therefore, we believe that video generation from natural language sentences will have an important impact on Artificial Intelligence. Video generation is relatively a new field of study in Computer Vision, which is far from being solved. The majority of recent works deal with synthetic datasets or real datasets with very limited types of objects, scenes, and emotions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first work on the text (free-form sentences) to video generation on more realistic video datasets like Actor and Action Dataset (A2D) or UCF101. We tackle the complicated problem of video generation by regressing the latent representations of the first and last frames and employing a context-aware interpolation method to build the latent representations of in-between frames. We propose a stacking ``upPooling'' block to sequentially generate RGB frames out of each latent representation and progressively increase the resolution. Moreover, our proposed Discriminator encodes videos based on single and multiple frames. We provide quantitative and qualitative results to support our arguments and show the superiority of our method over well-known baselines like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Deconvolution (as known as Convolutional Transpose) based video generation methods.",0
"This paper presents a generative model that utilizes latent path construction to improve temporal coherence between frames generated from natural language text descriptions. By incorporating a decoder that generates paths through continuous representations, our method enables longer and more diverse video generation than traditional approaches based on frame predictions alone.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via extensive experiments, including user studies evaluating both objective metrics such as visual fidelity and subjective human judgments regarding video plausibility and realism.",1
"Softmax classifiers with a very large number of classes naturally occur in many applications such as natural language processing and information retrieval. The calculation of full softmax is costly from the computational and energy perspective. There have been various sampling approaches to overcome this challenge, popularly known as negative sampling (NS). Ideally, NS should sample negative classes from a distribution that is dependent on the input data, the current parameters, and the correct positive class. Unfortunately, due to the dynamically updated parameters and data samples, there is no sampling scheme that is provably adaptive and samples the negative classes efficiently. Therefore, alternative heuristics like random sampling, static frequency-based sampling, or learning-based biased sampling, which primarily trade either the sampling cost or the adaptivity of samples per iteration are adopted. In this paper, we show two classes of distributions where the sampling scheme is truly adaptive and provably generates negative samples in near-constant time. Our implementation in C++ on CPU is significantly superior, both in terms of wall-clock time and accuracy, compared to the most optimized TensorFlow implementations of other popular negative sampling approaches on powerful NVIDIA V100 GPU.",0
"In recent years there has been increased interest in training data augmentation methods that increase efficiency without compromising quality of generated samples. This has led to considerable advances in model performance across multiple tasks and benchmark datasets. One such method that has gained popularity is negative sampling (NS), which involves augmenting the training set by adding artificially generated negative examples that have low similarity to real instances from the same class. NS has proven effective at increasing dataset size while preserving sample quality. However, different types of negative distributions have been proposed, each offering unique benefits depending on the application scenario. In particular, two recently introduced approaches - UniformNoise and GuidedBacktranslationSampler - offer competitive tradeoffs between speed, informativeness, effectiveness and scalability. UniformNoise adds uniform noise to existing positive exemplars to generate new negatives, while Guided Back Translation Sampler generates synthetic negatives guided by parallel text translation models and pretrained language models. While both approaches have shown strong results compared to conventional techniques, they differ significantly in terms of computational overhead and potential biases. This work provides a comprehensive comparison study evaluating these two efficient and informative negative sampling distribution strategies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability under different circumstances. We aim to provide guidance for practitioners wishing to apply these advanced sampling methods to improve large scale supervised learning applications, particularly those leveraging pre-training with transformer architectures as backbone models, where scaling and quality remain critical factors. Our experiments consider multiple configurations and stateof-the art architectures appliedto eight challenging classification tasks including GLUE benchmark datasets.

"Image Captioning is a task that combines computer vision and natural language processing, where it aims to generate descriptive legends for images. It is a two-fold process relying on accurate image understanding and correct language understanding both syntactically and semantically. It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with the latest research and findings in the field of image captioning due to the growing amount of knowledge available on the topic. There is not, however, enough coverage of those findings in the available review papers. We perform in this paper a run-through of the current techniques, datasets, benchmarks and evaluation metrics used in image captioning. The current research on the field is mostly focused on deep learning-based methods, where attention mechanisms along with deep reinforcement and adversarial learning appear to be in the forefront of this research topic. In this paper, we review recent methodologies such as UpDown, OSCAR, VIVO, Meta Learning and a model that uses conditional generative adversarial nets. Although the GAN-based model achieves the highest score, UpDown represents an important basis for image captioning and OSCAR and VIVO are more useful as they use novel object captioning.

"Image captioning is a task in the field of Artificial Intelligence that merges between computer vision and natural language processing. It is responsible for generating legends that describe images, and has various applications like descriptions used by assistive technology or indexing images (for search engines for instance). This makes it a crucial topic in AI that is undergoing a lot of research. This task however, like many others, is trained on large images labeled via human annotation, which can be very cumbersome: it needs manual effort, both financial and temporal costs, it is error-prone and potentially difficult to execute in some cases (e.g. medical images). To mitigate the need for labels, we attempt to use self-supervised learning, a type of learning where models use the data contained within the images themselves as labels. It is challenging to accomplish though, since the task is two-fold: the images and captions come from two different modalities and usually handled by different types of networks. It is thus not obvious what a completely self-supervised solution would look like. How it would achieve captioning in a comparable way to how self-supervision is applied today on image recognition tasks is still an ongoing research topic. In this project, we are using an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on OpenImages dataset and learns image features in a self-supervised fashion using the rotation pretext task. The decoder is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and it is trained, along within the image captioning model, on MS COCO dataset and is responsible of generating captions.

"Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI. Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered, more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing models that can perform tasks related to natural language processing (NLP) such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering. However, despite these advancements, embodied vision-language planning still poses many challenges that need to be addressed. This work focuses on identifying some of the core challenges in this area, including understanding the relationship between perception and action, integrating visual data with textual descriptions, dealing with uncertainty, and achieving robustness under real-world conditions. By analyzing these issues and discussing potential solutions, we aim to further advance the state-of-the-art in embodied NLP and contribute towards creating intelligent systems capable of effectively navigating and interacting with complex environments.",1
"Image manipulation with natural language, which aims to manipulate images with the guidance of language descriptions, has been a challenging problem in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Currently, a number of efforts have been made for this task, but their performances are still distant away from generating realistic and text-conformed manipulated images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memory-based Image Manipulation Network (MIM-Net), where a set of memories learned from images is introduced to synthesize the texture information with the guidance of the textual description. We propose a two-stage network with an additional reconstruction stage to learn the latent memories efficiently. To avoid the unnecessary background changes, we propose a Target Localization Unit (TLU) to focus on the manipulation of the region mentioned by the text. Moreover, to learn a robust memory, we further propose a novel randomized memory training loss. Experiments on the four popular datasets show the better performance of our method compared to the existing ones.",0
"This paper presents an innovative approach to semantic image manipulation using memory. By leveraging memory models such as transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we can generate images that adhere to specific semantic constraints while preserving their visual fidelity. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods in generating visually coherent and semantically meaningful outputs. Our work has applications in computer vision and graphics, including style transfer, editing, and content creation. Overall, this research contributes to the development of advanced artificial intelligence techniques for creative tasks, enabling new forms of artistic expression through technology.",1
"We introduce a method that allows to automatically segment images into semantically meaningful regions without human supervision. Derived regions are consistent across different images and coincide with human-defined semantic classes on some datasets. In cases where semantic regions might be hard for human to define and consistently label, our method is still able to find meaningful and consistent semantic classes. In our work, we use pretrained StyleGAN2~\cite{karras2020analyzing} generative model: clustering in the feature space of the generative model allows to discover semantic classes. Once classes are discovered, a synthetic dataset with generated images and corresponding segmentation masks can be created. After that a segmentation model is trained on the synthetic dataset and is able to generalize to real images. Additionally, by using CLIP~\cite{radford2021learning} we are able to use prompts defined in a natural language to discover some desired semantic classes. We test our method on publicly available datasets and show state-of-the-art results.",0
"In recent years there have been significant advances in computer vision tasks such as image segmentation using both traditional and deep learning approaches. However, these methods often require large amounts of labeled data and can still suffer from limited performance. Recently, unsupervised semantic image segmentation has emerged as a promising approach that enables fine-grained scene understanding without relying on extensive training datasets. This study proposes a novel unsupervised framework that utilizes Styled GANs (StyLEGAN) combined with Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP). Our method takes advantage of the generative capabilities of StyLEGAN to produce diverse and realistic semantic segmentations conditioned on arbitrary textual descriptions. These semantic labels are then used as supervision signals to train a feature extractor which captures relevant features for downstream segmentation tasks. By jointly optimizing the generator and discriminator objectives, we obtain high-quality, task-specific representations that generalize well across different domains and variations within each domain. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baseline models. We provide visualizations and ablation studies to showcase the superiority of our method in terms of generating accurate, diverse, and interpretable semantic segmentations. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model successfully transfers learned knowledge from one domain to another by performing zero-shot semantic segmentation experiments. Overall, our proposed technique offers an exciting opportunity towards developing powerful unsupervised semantic segmentation frameworks for applications in a wide range of fields including robotics, auton",1
"Self-supervised pre-training of large-scale transformer models on text corpora followed by finetuning has achieved state-of-the-art on a number of natural language processing tasks. Recently, Lu et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.05247) claimed that frozen pretrained transformers (FPTs) match or outperform training from scratch as well as unfrozen (fine-tuned) pretrained transformers in a set of transfer tasks to other modalities. In our work, we find that this result is, in fact, an artifact of not tuning the learning rates. After carefully redesigning the empirical setup, we find that when tuning learning rates properly, pretrained transformers do outperform or match training from scratch in all of our tasks, but only as long as the entire model is finetuned. Thus, while transfer from pretrained language models to other modalities does indeed provide gains and hints at exciting possibilities for future work, properly tuning hyperparameters is important for arriving at robust findings.",0
"Here is an example of what I am looking for:  Paper Title: What are the Impacts of Autonomous Cars on Society?  Abstract: This paper examines the potential impacts that autonomous cars may have on society once they become widely adopted. The authors begin by discussing the current state of development of self-driving vehicles, including their capabilities and limitations. They then explore how these technologies might affect issues such as safety, congestion, environmental sustainability, and public transportation. Finally, the paper considers potential policy implications related to regulating and integrating autonomous cars into existing infrastructure. Overall, the research presented here provides valuable insights into the complexities surrounding the implementation of autonomous vehicles and highlights important areas where further research is necessary.  This could easily be adapted to fit the specific topic and style you require while still meeting length guidelines (without including the paper title). Let me know if there is any other guidance required!  ---  This paper investigates the effects of cross-modal transfer on pretrained transformer models when fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Previous studies have shown mixed results regarding whether pretraining on one task can benefit performance on another unrelated task, but little attention has been given to understanding the extent and mechanism of cross-modal transfer. To address this gap, we present a thorough analysis of three commonly used pretraining techniques - image classification, masked language modelling, and machine translation - using several established benchmark datasets from different domains. Our findings reveal interesting patterns indicating that different combinations of pretraining objectives lead to varying levels of transfer. In particular, certain types of pretraining appear more effective than others in promoting positive transfer across modalities and tasks. We hope our work encourages future exploration of cross-modal transfer and inspires new methods for designing versatile pretraining algorithms suitable for diverse NLP applications.",1
"Transformer with self-attention has led to the revolutionizing of natural language processing field, and recently inspires the emergence of Transformer-style architecture design with competitive results in numerous computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, most of existing designs directly employ self-attention over a 2D feature map to obtain the attention matrix based on pairs of isolated queries and keys at each spatial location, but leave the rich contexts among neighbor keys under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel Transformer-style module, i.e., Contextual Transformer (CoT) block, for visual recognition. Such design fully capitalizes on the contextual information among input keys to guide the learning of dynamic attention matrix and thus strengthens the capacity of visual representation. Technically, CoT block first contextually encodes input keys via a $3\times3$ convolution, leading to a static contextual representation of inputs. We further concatenate the encoded keys with input queries to learn the dynamic multi-head attention matrix through two consecutive $1\times1$ convolutions. The learnt attention matrix is multiplied by input values to achieve the dynamic contextual representation of inputs. The fusion of the static and dynamic contextual representations are finally taken as outputs. Our CoT block is appealing in the view that it can readily replace each $3\times3$ convolution in ResNet architectures, yielding a Transformer-style backbone named as Contextual Transformer Networks (CoTNet). Through extensive experiments over a wide range of applications (e.g., image recognition, object detection and instance segmentation), we validate the superiority of CoTNet as a stronger backbone. Source code is available at \url{https://github.com/JDAI-CV/CoTNet}.",0
"This paper introduces Contextual Transformer Networks (CTN), which achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging visual recognition tasks by building upon efficient transformer architectures but adapting them to operate within image feature spaces rather than sequence data such as text. We show that CTNs effectively capture both spatial dependencies across pixels as well as semantic relationships across objects, enabling improved representation learning without explicit supervision or increased model complexity. CTNs significantly outperform existing methods including standard CNNs and vision transformers. Further, we discuss how attention operations can be better regularized under limited computational resources through sparsity inducing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the great potential of contextually adaptive representations based on selfattention mechanisms even in the domain of computer vision where classical convolutional models have been dominant so far. This work contributes new developments towards generalization of transformer architectures beyond text processing problems by designing principled solutions addressing structural differences between natural language and vision data. These advances build on strong theoretical grounds that bridge insights from deep learning theory with techniques exploiting hierarchical structure, novel normalization schemes, or computational efficiency measures specifically tailored for image classification and object detection scenarios. As one key takeaway message, our study reveals that merely replacing dense selfattention blocks with sparse ones is generally suboptimal whereas carefully integrating different interaction primitives at each level of scale allows leveraging taskspecific prior knowledge without losing expressiveness required by large scale datasets. In practice, these observations translate into flexible network designs providing more concise ways of approximati",1
"When humans solve complex problems, they rarely come up with a decision right-away. Instead, they start with an intuitive decision, reflect upon it, spot mistakes, resolve contradictions and jump between different hypotheses. Thus, they create a sequence of ideas and follow a train of thought that ultimately reaches a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's neural classification models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and fixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the opportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. We take inspiration from Hegel's dialectics and propose a method that turns an existing classifier's class prediction (such as the image class forest) into a sequence of predictions (such as forest $\rightarrow$ tree $\rightarrow$ mushroom). Concretely, we propose a correction module that is trained to estimate the model's correctness as well as an iterative prediction update based on the prediction's gradient. Our approach results in a dynamic system over class probability distributions $\unicode{x2014}$ the thought flow. We evaluate our method on diverse datasets and tasks from computer vision and natural language processing. We observe surprisingly complex but intuitive behavior and demonstrate that our method (i) can correct misclassifications, (ii) strengthens model performance, (iii) is robust to high levels of adversarial attacks, (iv) can increase accuracy up to 4% in a label-distribution-shift setting and (iv) provides a tool for model interpretability that uncovers model knowledge which otherwise remains invisible in a single distribution prediction.",0
"In ""Thought Flow Nets,"" we introduce the concept of thought flow nets as a novel framework that can generate and manipulate multiple models in sequence to perform complex tasks, including image generation, text translation, question answering, and more. We demonstrate how our approach can surpass single model results on several benchmarks by leveraging different types of pretrained LLMs (Large Language Models) without any fine-tuning. Our work offers new opportunities for researchers to create generative agents capable of understanding language and performing complex cognitive reasoning through human-like trains of thoughts.  The framework uses simple but powerful mechanisms, like attention pooling, to merge predictions from independent thought sequences into one coherent output. This allows us to handle multiple source domains at once while ensuring alignment of internal states between them. Our contributions consist of introducing the thought flow net idea, designing training algorithms, discussing analysis techniques, releasing code to the public domain for replication, outperforming strong baselines across datasets, reporting analyses on generated outputs and hidden activations, and presenting error diagnosis experiments to gain insights into model performance. This research has far-reaching implications in artificial intelligence, computer science, natural language processing, linguistics, philosophy, cognition, psychology, neuroscience, biological systems, engineering, data science, robotics, anthropology, sociology, education, ethics, futurology, economy, law, entertainment, media, arts, writing, design, communication, among others.",1
"We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture. The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.",0

"This paper is a presentation of a new method for denoising images using Haralick features and further segmenting the characters using artificial neural networks. The image is divided into kernels, each of which is converted to a GLCM (Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix) on which a Haralick Feature generation function is called, the result of which is an array with fourteen elements corresponding to fourteen features The Haralick values and the corresponding noise/text classification form a dictionary, which is then used to de-noise the image through kernel comparison. Segmentation is the process of extracting characters from a document and can be used when letters are separated by white space, which is an explicit boundary marker. Segmentation is the first step in many Natural Language Processing problems. This paper explores the process of segmentation using Neural Networks. While there have been numerous methods to segment characters of a document, this paper is only concerned with the accuracy of doing so using neural networks. It is imperative that the characters be segmented correctly, for failing to do so will lead to incorrect recognition by Natural language processing tools. Artificial Neural Networks was used to attain accuracy of upto 89%. This method is suitable for languages where the characters are delimited by white space. However, this method will fail to provide acceptable results when the language heavily uses connected letters. An example would be the Devanagari script, which is predominantly used in northern India.",0
"This research presents a new methodology for denoising and segmenting epigraphical scripts using machine learning techniques. We address two main challenges faced by previous methods: noise removal without losing important details, and accurate contour detection under varying image conditions. Our proposed model uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) pre-trained on synthetic data generated from real images. The network learns complex features that discriminate the script from background elements, enabling improved accuracy over traditional threshold-based approaches. In addition, we introduce a novel post-processing step that combines local edge detection and morphological operations to obtain more precise contours. Experimental results show significant improvements in both denoising and segmentation compared to current state-of-the-art techniques, particularly for degraded or low quality inscriptions. Overall, our approach represents a promising tool for digital humanities scholars working with historical documents, providing better accessibility and legibility for further analysis.",1
"Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate to a target location by following natural language instructions. Most of existing works represent a navigation candidate by the feature of the corresponding single view where the candidate lies in. However, an instruction may mention landmarks out of the single view as references, which might lead to failures of textual-visual matching of existing methods. In this work, we propose a multi-module Neighbor-View Enhanced Model (NvEM) to adaptively incorporate visual contexts from neighbor views for better textual-visual matching. Specifically, our NvEM utilizes a subject module and a reference module to collect contexts from neighbor views. The subject module fuses neighbor views at a global level, and the reference module fuses neighbor objects at a local level. Subjects and references are adaptively determined via attention me'chanisms. Our model also includes an action module to utilize the strong orientation guidance (e.g., ""turn left"") in instructions. Each module predicts navigation action separately and their weighted sum is used for predicting the final action. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the R2R and R4R benchmarks against several state-of-the-art navigators, and NvEM even beats some pre-training ones. Our code is available at https://github.com/MarSaKi/NvEM.",0
"Artificial intelligence systems have been rapidly improving their ability to navigate through visual scenes by using natural language instructions. However, these systems often struggle with understanding contextual relationships among objects within those scenes, such as spatial or temporal dependencies. This can lead to suboptimal performance on tasks that require reasoning about complex situations or interactions among multiple entities in the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called ""Neighbor-View Enhanced Model"" (NVEM), which leverages object relationships from neighboring views to enhance traditional vision-and-language navigation models. Our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on challenging benchmarks and demonstrates robustness under variations in environment configurations and text prompts. We evaluate our model's effectiveness in zero-shot generalization across unseen environments and discuss potential application scenarios in virtual reality and robotics. Overall, NVEM represents a significant step towards more advanced artificial agents capable of interacting with complex environments guided solely by human language direction.",1
"Language instruction plays an essential role in the natural language grounded navigation tasks. However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated instructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from the complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation performance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which is capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction, by using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Reinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the navigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive information in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the perturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized by the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions sequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score. Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial training strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task. Experimental results on both Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) tasks show the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the visualization analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed DR-Attacker, which can successfully attack crucial information in the instructions at different timesteps. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/DR-Attacker.",0
"Recent advancements in natural language processing have led to the development of powerful vision-language navigation systems that enable agents to interact with their environment using natural language instructions. However, these systems can still be susceptible to attacks from adversaries who may provide malicious input designed to manipulate the behavior of the agent. In this work, we propose a new framework called ""Adversarial Reinforced Instruction Attacker"" (ARIA) which enables attackers to generate adversarial examples tailored specifically towards vision-language navigation tasks. Our approach uses reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the instruction perturbations according to different objectives such as misguiding the agent into taking dangerous actions or maximizing the number of steps taken by the agent before reaching its goal. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating successful attacks against state-of-the-art navigation models on benchmark datasets while requiring minimal computational resources. Our work highlights the importance of robustness evaluation in the field of vision-language navigation and encourages future research in developing defenses against adversarial attacks in this domain.",1
"We define disentanglement as how far class-different data points from each other are, relative to the distances among class-similar data points. When maximizing disentanglement during representation learning, we obtain a transformed feature representation where the class memberships of the data points are preserved. If the class memberships of the data points are preserved, we would have a feature representation space in which a nearest neighbour classifier or a clustering algorithm would perform well. We take advantage of this method to learn better natural language representation, and employ it on text classification and text clustering tasks. Through disentanglement, we obtain text representations with better-defined clusters and improve text classification performance. Our approach had a test classification accuracy of as high as 90.11% and test clustering accuracy of 88% on the AG News dataset, outperforming our baseline models -- without any other training tricks or regularization.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to text classification and clustering using annealing soft nearest neighbor loss (ASNNL). ASNNL extends traditional nearest neighbor methods by allowing the distance between samples to be relaxed during training, enabling more flexible representations that capture higher order relationships between data points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements over baseline models. Our results suggest that ASNNL has strong potential as a general purpose framework for unsupervised learning tasks.",1
"We present a new four-pronged approach to build firefighter's situational awareness for the first time in the literature. We construct a series of deep learning frameworks built on top of one another to enhance the safety, efficiency, and successful completion of rescue missions conducted by firefighters in emergency first response settings. First, we used a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system to classify and identify objects of interest from thermal imagery in real-time. Next, we extended this CNN framework for object detection, tracking, segmentation with a Mask RCNN framework, and scene description with a multimodal natural language processing(NLP) framework. Third, we built a deep Q-learning-based agent, immune to stress-induced disorientation and anxiety, capable of making clear navigation decisions based on the observed and stored facts in live-fire environments. Finally, we used a low computational unsupervised learning technique called tensor decomposition to perform meaningful feature extraction for anomaly detection in real-time. With these ad-hoc deep learning structures, we built the artificial intelligence system's backbone for firefighters' situational awareness. To bring the designed system into usage by firefighters, we designed a physical structure where the processed results are used as inputs in the creation of an augmented reality capable of advising firefighters of their location and key features around them, which are vital to the rescue operation at hand, as well as a path planning feature that acts as a virtual guide to assist disoriented first responders in getting back to safety. When combined, these four approaches present a novel approach to information understanding, transfer, and synthesis that could dramatically improve firefighter response and efficacy and reduce life loss.",0
"This research explores how deep learning can enhance situational awareness during firefights by integrating augmented reality technologies into training simulations. We propose using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural network (CNNs) algorithms to process video footage from helmet cameras worn by firefighters and detect key features such as smoke density, heat sources, flame heights, and structural hazards. We then feed these outputs into an augmented reality headset, which provides real-time visualization of the inferred data overlaid onto the actual environment seen through the user’s field of view. Our approach seeks to provide greater insight into complex environments while reducing cognitive load on firefighters who must navigate dangerous situations quickly and efficiently. Results indicate our methodology improves decision making speed by up to 49% while increasing accuracy by up to 27%. By equipping first responders with advanced tools for enhanced perception, we improve their safety and increase chances of successful missions in high stakes emergency scenarios. Is there a particular aspect of the abstract that you would like me to focus on? The main objective of this study was to explore the potential benefits of integrating deep learning techniques with AR technology for use in firefighting operations. Helmet camera footage captured from firefighters was analyzed with artificial neural networks and CNNs, allowing for real-time identification of critical factors affecting fire behavior including smoke density, heat sources, flame height, and structural conditions. These results were projected through an AR display viewed by the firefighter in order to gain additional insights into the unfolding situation without diverting attention away from other important tasks. The findings showed that this integrated approach could greatly benefit firefighters by providing them more accurate and timely information, potentially improving response times and minimizing risk exposure in challenging circumstances. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to better equip those serving in harm's way to protect lives and property.",1
"Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved great success in predictive accuracy in a variety of tasks, but deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to produce highly overconfident scores for even abnormal samples. Well-defined uncertainty indicates whether a model's output should (or should not) be trusted and thus becomes critical in real-world scenarios which typically involves shifted input distributions due to many factors. Existing uncertainty approaches assume that testing samples from a different data distribution would induce unreliable model predictions thus have higher uncertainty scores. They quantify model uncertainty by calibrating DL model's confidence of a given input and evaluate the effectiveness in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)-related tasks. However, their methodologies' reliability may be compromised under programming tasks due to difference in data representations and shift patterns. In this paper, we first define three different types of distribution shift in program data and build a large-scale shifted Java dataset. We implement two common programming language tasks on our dataset to study the effect of each distribution shift on DL model performance. We also propose a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art predictive uncertainty on programming tasks and investigate their effectiveness under data distribution shift. Experiments show that program distribution shift does degrade the DL model performance to varying degrees and that existing uncertainty methods all present certain limitations in quantifying uncertainty on program dataset.",0
"In many real-world applications, predicting outcomes based on data can be challenging due to changes in the distribution of input variables over time. This phenomenon, known as program data distribution shift (PDDS), can lead to degraded performance of machine learning models and reduced confidence in their predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel methodology for estimating predictive uncertainty under PDDS conditions. Our approach uses a combination of Bayesian methods and domain knowledge to quantify the impact of shifting distributions on model accuracy and reliability. We evaluate our framework using simulation studies and demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies involving financial forecasting and medical diagnosis tasks. Our findings show that our proposed method leads to significantly improved prediction intervals compared to existing approaches, resulting in more robust decision making processes even under uncertain conditions. Overall, our work contributes towards building more resilient predictive systems capable of handling unforeseen changes in data characteristics, which is crucial for ensuring trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems.",1
"Faces generated using generative adversarial networks (GANs) have reached unprecedented realism. These faces, also known as ""Deep Fakes"", appear as realistic photographs with very little pixel-level distortions. While some work has enabled the training of models that lead to the generation of specific properties of the subject, generating a facial image based on a natural language description has not been fully explored. For security and criminal identification, the ability to provide a GAN-based system that works like a sketch artist would be incredibly useful. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate facial images from semantic text descriptions. The learned model is provided with a text description and an outline of the type of face, which the model uses to sketch the features. Our models are trained using an Affine Combination Module (ACM) mechanism to combine the text embedding from BERT and the GAN latent space using a self-attention matrix. This avoids the loss of features due to inadequate ""attention"", which may happen if text embedding and latent vector are simply concatenated. Our approach is capable of generating images that are very accurately aligned to the exhaustive textual descriptions of faces with many fine detail features of the face and helps in generating better images. The proposed method is also capable of making incremental changes to a previously generated image if it is provided with additional textual descriptions or sentences.",0
"Introduce any terminology that needs explaining before using it in your abstract! Also provide details on who might find it relevant. --  In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become increasingly popular for generating realistic synthetic data such as images, videos, and audio signals. One major limitation of these models, however, is their lack of interpretability. In other words, while they can generate visually appealing outputs, they struggle to explain how they achieve those results. This has limited their adoption in fields where there is a need for explicit meaning extraction from multimedia content. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called ""Semantic Text-to-Face GAN"" (or ST^2FG). Our model combines the strengths of GANs with textual semantic representations, enabling it to produce more interpretable results by mapping input text descriptions into corresponding face images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets: Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA-HQ. Overall, our work has important implications across many domains ranging from computer graphics to facial recognition systems and natural language processing.",1
"Deep learning's success has been widely recognized in a variety of machine learning tasks, including image classification, audio recognition, and natural language processing. As an extension of deep learning beyond these domains, graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to handle the non-Euclidean graph-structure which is intractable to previous deep learning techniques. Existing GNNs are presented using various techniques, making direct comparison and cross-reference more complex. Although existing studies categorize GNNs into spatial-based and spectral-based techniques, there hasn't been a thorough examination of their relationship. To close this gap, this study presents a single framework that systematically incorporates most GNNs. We organize existing GNNs into spatial and spectral domains, as well as expose the connections within each domain. A review of spectral graph theory and approximation theory builds a strong relationship across the spatial and spectral domains in further investigation.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing data represented as graphs. While many studies focus on bridging the gap between spatial and spectral domains using GNNs, there remains a significant research gap. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey that explores state-of-the-art approaches for merging topological information from both domains. Our review highlights key insights into advances made in designing efficient algorithms and models capable of exploiting both domain representations, including convolutional graph neural networks, message passing methods, graph attention mechanisms, and multi-channel techniques. We further discuss how these innovations can improve applications such as node classification, link prediction, graph clustering, and anomaly detection in diverse fields ranging from computer vision to natural language processing. Finally, we outline future directions aimed at promoting further progress toward achieving seamless integration across multiple domains in GNNs.",1
"Communication between agents in collaborative multi-agent settings is in general implicit or a direct data stream. This paper considers text-based natural language as a novel form of communication between multiple agents trained with reinforcement learning. This could be considered first steps toward a truly autonomous communication without the need to define a limited set of instructions, and natural collaboration between humans and robots. Inspired by the game of Blind Leads, we propose an environment where one agent uses natural language instructions to guide another through a maze. We test the ability of reinforcement learning agents to effectively communicate through discrete word-level symbols and show that the agents are able to sufficiently communicate through natural language with a limited vocabulary. Although the communication is not always perfect English, the agents are still able to navigate the maze. We achieve a BLEU score of 0.85, which is an improvement of 0.61 over randomly generated sequences while maintaining a 100% maze completion rate. This is a 3.5 times the performance of the random baseline using our reference set.",0
"In recent years there has been increased interest in developing artificial intelligence agents capable of learning from experience, commonly referred to as reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. These methods have shown impressive results in domains such as video games and robotics control tasks. However, many RL algorithms lack interpretability due to their complex nature and black box design. As RL becomes more widely adopted across various industries, explainability is becoming increasingly important. To address these shortcomings, we propose using natural language to communicate with collaborative reinforcement learning agents. By doing so, humans can provide feedback on agent behavior, ensuring that they act according to desired objectives and constraints. This study presents two text communication frameworks suitable for collaboration: one based on simple prompts, and another using a pre-trained GPT model for generating instructions from human feedback through interactive reward augmentation. Our experimental evaluation shows consistent improvement over standard RL policies using human feedback provided via text messages. These contributions towards creating interpretable RL agents with enhanced performance set the stage for future research into multiagent environments where effective collaboration is necessary for successful decision making.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating single-step policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to factorize the problem in time. However, we can also view RL as a sequence modeling problem, with the goal being to predict a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether powerful, high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide simple and effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be reframed as ""one big sequence modeling"" problem, using state-of-the-art Transformer architectures to model distributions over sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Addressing RL as a sequence modeling problem significantly simplifies a range of design decisions: we no longer require separate behavior policy constraints, as is common in prior work on offline model-free RL, and we no longer require ensembles or other epistemic uncertainty estimators, as is common in prior work on model-based RL. All of these roles are filled by the same Transformer sequence model. In our experiments, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL.",0
"In natural language processing (NLP), sequence modeling deals with predicting or generating sequences of tokens such as text or speech. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were once popular models used to solve these problems due to their ability to retain information over time by using hidden states that carry context across iterations. However, RNNs suffer from vanishing gradient issues which makes them difficult to train on tasks with long dependencies. This issue led researchers to propose alternatives like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). These solutions have improved upon some shortcomings of traditional RNN architectures but still face challenges related to scalability, efficiency, and explainability. In recent years, transformer architectures have emerged as a new paradigm for NLP and have largely replaced recurrent models owing to their superior performance in terms of accuracy and training speed, especially when dealing with large datasets. Transformers use self attention mechanisms that allow parallel computation without losing sequential information unlike previous approaches. They operate exclusively on attention rather than relying on recurrence making them more powerful in certain scenarios. Despite this progress, there remains room for improvement to enhance interpretability and reduce computational overhead when dealing with limited data or small models. Reinforcement learning provides one approach towards addressing these limitations. The objective of this work is to explore sequence modeling through reinforcement learning where we formulate each token prediction step as a Markov decision process",1
"Developing video understanding intelligence is quite challenging because it requires holistic integration of images, scripts, and sounds based on natural language processing, temporal dependency, and reasoning. Recently, substantial attempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question answering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video question answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make progress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans understand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of understanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for VideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive Modules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules: targets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the understanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: ""I understand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING."" Each module has sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required aspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual questions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of VideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for validating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of the DramaQA dataset by applying CogME. The evaluation reveals that story elements are unevenly reflected in the existing dataset, and the model based on the dataset may cause biased predictions. Although this study has only been able to grasp a narrow range of stories, we expect that it offers the first step in considering the cognitive process of humans on the video understanding intelligence of humans and AI.",0
"Effective evaluation metrics play a crucial role in assessing the performance of video understanding models. In recent years, several metrics have been proposed that aim to measure different aspects of video intelligence such as object detection accuracy, action recognition, temporal segmentation, and spatio-temporal reasoning. However, these existing metrics often suffer from limitations like overfitting to specific datasets, poor correlation with human judgments, or high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new metric called Cognitive Measures of Excellence (CogME) which incorporates both quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate multiple facets of video intelligence including visual fidelity, semantic meaning, narrative structure, attention control, causality modeling, memory recall, and context awareness. Our approach utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques along with cognitively inspired frameworks to ensure robustness, interpretability, and generalization across diverse datasets. We empirically validate our method on benchmark datasets for action recognition, event localization, activity detection, and storyboard generation tasks, showing significant improvements compared to existing metrics. Overall, CogME provides a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation framework that aligns better with human perception and expectations of video understanding systems. This work paves the way for developing smarter AI systems with advanced cognitive abilities that can perform complex real-world tasks with greater efficiency and effectiveness.",1
"Detecting customized moments and highlights from videos given natural language (NL) user queries is an important but under-studied topic. One of the challenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address this issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset. It consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics, from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and political activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated with: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video w.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all query-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and evaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for diverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this task, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment retrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query representations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores end-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it performs competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures. With weakly supervised pretraining using ASR captions, Moment-DETR substantially outperforms previous methods. Lastly, we present several ablations and visualizations of Moment-DETR. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/jayleicn/moment_detr",0
"Abstract: In this paper, we present QVHighlights, a system that enables users to easily navigate through videos by specifying natural language queries. Our approach uses state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to detect moments and highlights in videos based on these queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using real-world datasets and showcase how QVHighlights can provide more accurate results than traditional methods such as keyword-based retrieval. Additionally, we evaluate user feedback and engagement with QVHighlights to confirm its potential for improving video search and navigation systems. Overall, our work has important implications for multimedia processing research and practice, enabling efficient access to key parts of videos through intuitive and flexible human-computer interaction.",1
"We develop a novel approach to conformal prediction when the target task has limited data available for training. Conformal prediction identifies a small set of promising output candidates in place of a single prediction, with guarantees that the set contains the correct answer with high probability. When training data is limited, however, the predicted set can easily become unusably large. In this work, we obtain substantially tighter prediction sets while maintaining desirable marginal guarantees by casting conformal prediction as a meta-learning paradigm over exchangeable collections of auxiliary tasks. Our conformalization algorithm is simple, fast, and agnostic to the choice of underlying model, learning algorithm, or dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a number of few-shot classification and regression tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and computational chemistry for drug discovery.",0
"In recent years, few-shot learning has emerged as a promising approach to enable machines to learn from small amounts of data. One challenge that remains in many applications is how to adapt these methods to real world settings where there may be noise, missing values, and other types of uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called ""Few-Shot Conformal Prediction with Auxiliary Tasks"" (FSCP). Our framework uses auxiliary tasks in conjunction with conformal prediction techniques to improve model robustness and provide confidence estimates for predictions made under uncertain conditions. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets across different domains and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy and reliability. Overall, our work demonstrates that combining conformal prediction with auxiliary tasks can effectively solve challenges associated with making accurate predictions in high-dimensional spaces even when faced with limited training data and significant uncertainty.",1
"Transformers have been successful for many natural language processing tasks. However, applying transformers to the video domain for tasks such as long-term video generation and scene understanding has remained elusive due to the high computational complexity and the lack of natural tokenization. In this paper, we propose the Object-Centric Video Transformer (OCVT) which utilizes an object-centric approach for decomposing scenes into tokens suitable for use in a generative video transformer. By factoring the video into objects, our fully unsupervised model is able to learn complex spatio-temporal dynamics of multiple interacting objects in a scene and generate future frames of the video. Our model is also significantly more memory-efficient than pixel-based models and thus able to train on videos of length up to 70 frames with a single 48GB GPU. We compare our model with previous RNN-based approaches as well as other possible video transformer baselines. We demonstrate OCVT performs well when compared to baselines in generating future frames. OCVT also develops useful representations for video reasoning, achieving start-of-the-art performance on the CATER task.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to video generation using transformers that allows objects within the scene to serve as ""words"" in a sentence. By treating each object as a discrete unit, we can generate new sequences by simply rearranging these objects according to desired grammatical rules. Our model takes advantage of recent advances in generative pretraining and image synthesis to create high quality results that capture both visual fidelity and semantic coherence. We evaluate our method on several challenging benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. In summary, our work shows that using objects as building blocks for video generation is a promising direction with exciting potential applications in areas such as computer graphics, animation, and virtual reality.",1
"Video captioning, i.e. the task of generating captions from video sequences creates a bridge between the Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision domains of computer science. The task of generating a semantically accurate description of a video is quite complex. Considering the complexity, of the problem, the results obtained in recent research works are praiseworthy. However, there is plenty of scope for further investigation. This paper addresses this scope and proposes a novel solution. Most video captioning models comprise two sequential/recurrent layers - one as a video-to-context encoder and the other as a context-to-caption decoder. This paper proposes a novel architecture, namely Semantically Sensible Video Captioning (SSVC) which modifies the context generation mechanism by using two novel approaches - ""stacked attention"" and ""spatial hard pull"". As there are no exclusive metrics for evaluating video captioning models, we emphasize both quantitative and qualitative analysis of our model. Hence, we have used the BLEU scoring metric for quantitative analysis and have proposed a human evaluation metric for qualitative analysis, namely the Semantic Sensibility (SS) scoring metric. SS Score overcomes the shortcomings of common automated scoring metrics. This paper reports that the use of the aforementioned novelties improves the performance of state-of-the-art architectures.",0
"Title: ""Stacked Attention and Semantic Hard Pull for Improved Video Captioning""  This paper presents a novel approach to video captioning that combines stacked attention and semantic hard pull techniques to improve the accuracy and coherence of generated captions. In traditional approaches to video captioning, attention mechanisms are used to weigh the importance of different input frames when predicting each output word. However, these methods can still suffer from semantic ambiguity and incoherency in the resulting captions. To address these issues, our proposed method utilizes a two-stage process involving both local and global context. Firstly, a local context module uses stacked attention to weight the contribution of individual frames within short time intervals (local windows). This helps capture fine-grained relationships among temporally adjacent features and improves the model’s ability to resolve ambiguous semantics. Secondly, a global context module employs semantic hard pull, which forces the model to attend to high-level concepts present throughout the entire video sequence. By incorporating both local and global context, our model generates more accurate and semantically meaningful captions than state-of-the-art video captioning systems. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward in advancing the field of automatic video description and has promising applications in areas such as accessibility, entertainment, and surveillance.",1
"Academic advances of AI models in high-precision domains, like healthcare, need to be made explainable in order to enhance real-world adoption. Our past studies and ongoing interactions indicate that medical experts can use AI systems with greater trust if there are ways to connect the model inferences about patients to explanations that are tied back to the context of use. Specifically, risk prediction is a complex problem of diagnostic and interventional importance to clinicians wherein they consult different sources to make decisions. To enable the adoption of the ever improving AI risk prediction models in practice, we have begun to explore techniques to contextualize such models along three dimensions of interest: the patients' clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We validate the importance of these dimensions by implementing a proof-of-concept (POC) in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) use case where we assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a common T2DM comorbidity. Within the POC, we include risk prediction models for CKD, post-hoc explainers of the predictions, and other natural-language modules which operationalize domain knowledge and CPGs to provide context. With primary care physicians (PCP) as our end-users, we present our initial results and clinician feedback in this paper. Our POC approach covers multiple knowledge sources and clinical scenarios, blends knowledge to explain data and predictions to PCPs, and received an enthusiastic response from our medical expert.",0
"One possible approach for creating an effective AI language model is to use data from a wide range of domains and tasks, allowing the model to learn patterns that are relevant across different contexts and applications. This can make the resulting system more flexible and adaptive, able to handle a wider variety of inputs and questions. Additionally, utilizing diverse training data allows the AI to capture relationships between concepts and entities that may not have been explicitly defined by human developers, potentially leading to enhanced performance on novel problems. Incorporating clinical records into conversational AI models has shown promising results in improving understanding of health related conditions and treatments as well as personalized recommendations based on individual patient histories. Our research explores user-centered explainability of diabetes treatment plans using a large corpus of medical knowledge derived from academic literature and structured electronic health record data collected during routine care. We then evaluate how different levels of explanatory detail impact user trust, perceived expertise and confidence in accepting automated treatment advice. Our findings suggest that providing tailored explanations can increase acceptance rates for automated treatment plans while maintaining high levels of perceived expertise and trustworthiness. Overall, our study suggests that leveraging large scale datasets and incorporating them within NLP systems can drive significant advancements towards more human like interactions and ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes via automation.",1
"Black-box machine learning learning methods are now routinely used in high-risk settings, like medical diagnostics, which demand uncertainty quantification to avoid consequential model failures. Distribution-free uncertainty quantification (distribution-free UQ) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous confidence intervals/sets for such predictions. Critically, the intervals/sets are valid without distributional assumptions or model assumptions, with explicit guarantees with finitely many datapoints. Moreover, they adapt to the difficulty of the input; when the input example is difficult, the uncertainty intervals/sets are large, signaling that the model might be wrong. Without much work, one can use distribution-free methods on any underlying algorithm, such as a neural network, to produce confidence sets guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. Indeed, the methods are easy-to-understand and general, applying to many modern prediction problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed at a reader interested in the practical implementation of distribution-free UQ, including conformal prediction and related methods, who is not necessarily a statistician. We will include many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python, with PyTorch syntax. The goal is to provide the reader a working understanding of distribution-free UQ, allowing them to put confidence intervals on their algorithms, with one self-contained document.",0
"Abstract: In machine learning, uncertainty quantification is an important task that involves estimating how confident we can be about predictions made by our models. One popular method for uncertainty quantification is conformal prediction, which allows us to compute guaranteed error rates (also known as ""credible regions"") without any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This makes conformal prediction particularly useful when little is known about the data, such as when dealing with outliers or noisy data. In this work, we provide a gentle introduction to conformal prediction and show how it can be used for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. We start by reviewing some basic concepts from probability theory and statistical inference, then introduce conformal prediction and explain how it works. Finally, we illustrate the use of conformal prediction through several examples using both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility. Overall, this paper provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of conformal prediction and highlights its potential applications in various fields where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",1
"Natural language often exhibits inherent hierarchical structure ingrained with complex syntax and semantics. However, most state-of-the-art deep generative models learn embeddings only in Euclidean vector space, without accounting for this structural property of language. In this paper, we investigate text generation in a hyperbolic latent space to learn continuous hierarchical representations. An Adversarial Poincare Variational Autoencoder (APo-VAE) is presented, where both the prior and variational posterior of latent variables are defined over a Poincare ball via wrapped normal distributions. By adopting the primal-dual formulation of KL divergence, an adversarial learning procedure is introduced to empower robust model training. Extensive experiments in language modeling and dialog-response generation tasks demonstrate the winning effectiveness of the proposed APo-VAE model over VAEs in Euclidean latent space, thanks to its superb capabilities in capturing latent language hierarchies in hyperbolic space.",0
"The hyperboloid model has been used successfully as a generalization of the vanilla VAE (Variational Autoencoder) architecture that can generate images. This work extends the use of hyperbolic space to text generation by introducing the hyperbolically constrained flowing autoencoder or Apo-VAE. We show on benchmark datasets how our approach outperforms other models for inference and sampling tasks. Additionally we evaluate the importance of using a hyperbolic latent distribution over a spherical one, emphasizing their effectiveness in generating coherent and diverse text outputs while controlling the level of hallucination present within generated sentences. Our method thus provides an alternative to traditional VAEs for natural language processing applications and offers interesting perspectives on the understanding of texts through non-Euclidean spaces.",1
"The world of empirical machine learning (ML) strongly relies on benchmarks in order to determine the relative effectiveness of different algorithms and methods. This paper proposes the notion of ""a benchmark lottery"" that describes the overall fragility of the ML benchmarking process. The benchmark lottery postulates that many factors, other than fundamental algorithmic superiority, may lead to a method being perceived as superior. On multiple benchmark setups that are prevalent in the ML community, we show that the relative performance of algorithms may be altered significantly simply by choosing different benchmark tasks, highlighting the fragility of the current paradigms and potential fallacious interpretation derived from benchmarking ML methods. Given that every benchmark makes a statement about what it perceives to be important, we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss the implications of the observed phenomena and provide recommendations on mitigating them using multiple machine learning domains and communities as use cases, including natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.",0
"""This"" (The) Benchmark Lottery: A Comprehensive Guide for Choosing Effective Datasets =====================================================================================  The choice of benchmark datasets has become increasingly important as machine learning models have been integrated into many facets of our lives. Despite their widespread use, there remains no systematic way to choose effective benchmark datasets. In response, we propose the ""Benchmark Lottery,"" a framework that allows practitioners to make informed decisions about which benchmark dataset to use based on specific needs and characteristics. We describe how to create lotteries using two different approaches - randomization and non-randomization methods - as well as how to evaluate them by measuring both effectiveness and efficiency metrics. Through case studies, we demonstrate the utility of the Benchmark Lottery framework in real-world scenarios such as selecting the most appropriate benchmarks for image classification tasks in wildlife monitoring applications or choosing suitable benchmark datasets for developing sentiment analysis models for social media platforms. Overall, the Benchmark Lottery provides an accessible methodology for making better benchmark choices while minimizing human bias, promoting diversity in model evaluations, and fostering trustworthy Artificial Intelligence systems. # Full text without ""this"":  Introduction ------------  The choice of benchmark datasets has become increasingly critical due to the rapid integration of machine learning models into various aspects of society. However, a standardized approach to selecting effective benchmark datasets is lacking, leading to suboptimal evaluations of these models. This deficiency poses substantial risks to users, developers, organizations, and societies at large, since inferior evaluations can result in deceptive claims, harmful biases, unintended consequences, and other unwanted impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of a ""Benchmark Lottery"" in order to assist decision makers in selecting appropriate benchmark datasets according to predefined requirements and constraints. Our approach incorporates tw",1
"Visual Question Answering (VQA) is concerned with answering free-form questions about an image. Since it requires a deep semantic and linguistic understanding of the question and the ability to associate it with various objects that are present in the image, it is an ambitious task and requires multi-modal reasoning from both computer vision and natural language processing. We propose Graphhopper, a novel method that approaches the task by integrating knowledge graph reasoning, computer vision, and natural language processing techniques. Concretely, our method is based on performing context-driven, sequential reasoning based on the scene entities and their semantic and spatial relationships. As a first step, we derive a scene graph that describes the objects in the image, as well as their attributes and their mutual relationships. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to autonomously navigate in a multi-hop manner over the extracted scene graph to generate reasoning paths, which are the basis for deriving answers. We conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset GQA, based on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs. Our results show that we keep up with a human performance on manually curated scene graphs. Moreover, we find that Graphhopper outperforms another state-of-the-art scene graph reasoning model on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs by a significant margin.",0
"This paper presents Graphhopper, a novel multi-hop scene graph reasoning method for visual question answering (VQA). VQA is a challenging task that involves understanding images and natural language queries to generate answers. Existing methods have focused on either local feature analysis or global context modeling but lack effective ways to integrate these two levels of knowledge. Graphhopper addresses this issue by proposing a hierarchical scene representation where nodes represent image regions, edges indicate spatial relationships, and each edge can correspond to multiple attributes. This allows us to perform multi-hop reasoning over scenes through iteratively updating the node features using messages from neighboring regions. We then use a neural network to read out the final answer based on the updated node features and their dependencies within the whole scene graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves over state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks while providing clear insights into how scene graphs guide the reasoning process. By bridging local perception and holistic comprehension, our work takes a step towards more human-like VQA models capable of complex inference and decision making.",1
"We address the problem of text-guided video temporal grounding, which aims to identify the time interval of certain event based on a natural language description. Different from most existing methods that only consider RGB images as visual features, we propose a multi-modal framework to extract complementary information from videos. Specifically, we adopt RGB images for appearance, optical flow for motion, and depth maps for image structure. While RGB images provide abundant visual cues of certain event, the performance may be affected by background clutters. Therefore, we use optical flow to focus on large motion and depth maps to infer the scene configuration when the action is related to objects recognizable with their shapes. To integrate the three modalities more effectively and enable inter-modal learning, we design a dynamic fusion scheme with transformers to model the interactions between modalities. Furthermore, we apply intra-modal self-supervised learning to enhance feature representations across videos for each modality, which also facilitates multi-modal learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets, and show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"In recent years, multi-modal video temporal grounding has become an important research area due to its applications in fields such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and human-computer interaction. One approach to address this problem is by using end-to-end deep learning models that can jointly model visual and textual modalities without requiring hand-engineered features or explicit supervision for alignment. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end multi-modal video temporal grounding method based on transformers, which have recently achieved state-of-the-art results in natural language processing tasks. Our proposed method leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across modalities, allowing the model to accurately align temporal boundaries across different granularity levels. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets (ActivityNet Captions, MSVD, and TACoS) and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we perform ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of each component in our system, further validating the importance of cross-modality attention modules for successful end-to-end multi-modal video temporal grounding. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward towards achieving efficient and accurate multi-modal video understanding systems.",1
"With the rise of voice chat rooms, a gigantic resource of data can be exposed to the research community for natural language processing tasks. Moderators in voice chat rooms actively monitor the discussions and remove the participants with offensive language. However, it makes the hate speech detection even more difficult since some participants try to find creative ways to articulate hate speech. This makes the hate speech detection challenging in new social media like Clubhouse. To the best of our knowledge all the hate speech datasets have been collected from text resources like Twitter. In this paper, we take the first step to collect a significant dataset from Clubhouse as the rising star in social media industry. We analyze the collected instances from statistical point of view using the Google Perspective Scores. Our experiments show that, the Perspective Scores can outperform Bag of Words and Word2Vec as high level text features.",0
"Title: Detecting Hateful Language on GitHub using Machine Learning  GitHub has implemented several tools designed to prevent harrassment on their platform. This study examines one such tool - Clubhouse - which allows users to report inappropriate language by labeling them as ""Uncivil"" messages. The authors aim to create a machine learning model capable of identifying uncivil messages accurately without relying heavily on supervised training data. To achieve this goal, they use a combination of preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and Part Of Speech (POS) tagging. They then train their model using different features extracted from each message and evaluate its performance through precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy metrics. Results show that their proposed method achieves high accuracy in detecting civil vs uncivil messages compared to traditional rule-based methods. The results provide promising evidence towards building intelligent platforms like Clubhouse more efficiently.  This paper presents a novel approach for detecting hate speech on GitHub's platform. Specifically, we focus on the Clubhouse feature, which allows users to flag messages containing uncivil language. Our work seeks to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of recognizing uncivil messages without requiring extensive amounts of labeled data. We achieve this through careful preprocessing steps, including text cleanup, POS tagging, and feature extraction. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over traditional rule-based methods across multiple metrics, suggesting that our model can effectively identify incidents of hate speech. Overall, our findings have implications for building more efficient online communities and mitigating harassment on social media platforms.",1
"Compared to consumer lending, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (mSME) credit risk modelling is particularly challenging, as, often, the same sources of information are not available. Therefore, it is standard policy for a loan officer to provide a textual loan assessment to mitigate limited data availability. In turn, this statement is analysed by a credit expert alongside any available standard credit data. In our paper, we exploit recent advances from the field of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), including the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, to extract information from 60 000 textual assessments provided by a lender. We consider the performance in terms of the AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) and Brier Score metrics and find that the text alone is surprisingly effective for predicting default. However, when combined with traditional data, it yields no additional predictive capability, with performance dependent on the text's length. Our proposed deep learning model does, however, appear to be robust to the quality of the text and therefore suitable for partly automating the mSME lending process. We also demonstrate how the content of loan assessments influences performance, leading us to a series of recommendations on a new strategy for collecting future mSME loan assessments.",0

Our models achieve higher accuracy than traditional approaches using simple financial indicators like debt ratio or liquidity metrics alone. Furthermore, we show that our models generalize well by testing them on previously unseen industry datasets. By combining large amounts of textual data with powerful machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate that NLP can effectively forecast defaults even without access to sensitive financial statements or customer credit scores. Our results have implications for risk management, fraud detection, and credit underwriting, among other applications.",1
"Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a multi-modal challenging task widely considered by research communities of the computer vision and natural language processing. Since most current medical VQA models focus on visual content, ignoring the importance of text, this paper proposes a multi-view attention-based model(MuVAM) for medical visual question answering which integrates the high-level semantics of medical images on the basis of text description. Firstly, different methods are utilized to extract the features of the image and the question for the two modalities of vision and text. Secondly, this paper proposes a multi-view attention mechanism that include Image-to-Question (I2Q) attention and Word-to-Text (W2T) attention. Multi-view attention can correlate the question with image and word in order to better analyze the question and get an accurate answer. Thirdly, a composite loss is presented to predict the answer accurately after multi-modal feature fusion and improve the similarity between visual and textual cross-modal features. It consists of classification loss and image-question complementary (IQC) loss. Finally, for data errors and missing labels in the VQA-RAD dataset, we collaborate with medical experts to correct and complete this dataset and then construct an enhanced dataset, VQA-RADPh. The experiments on these two datasets show that the effectiveness of MuVAM surpasses the state-of-the-art method.",0
"In recent years, visual question answering (VQA) has emerged as a challenging task that requires both computer vision and natural language processing capabilities. VQA systems aim to provide answers to questions asked about images by accurately understanding the content of those images and how they relate to the textual queries posed. However, most existing VQA models rely heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can suffer from limited attention mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance.  This study presents a new multi-view attention-based model called MuVAM for medical VQA tasks, addressing these limitations. Our proposed model employs multiple view modules, each focusing on different aspects of image representation such as object detection, region feature extraction, and scene classification. These views are then fused using attention mechanisms based on spatial relations among objects detected in the image. Additionally, we introduce a novel attention mechanism that considers the relevance of individual CNN layers when aggregating information from different views.  We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, namely MCQA and NDSToxDB. Experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvements over several state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness at providing accurate answers to complex medical VQA tasks. Furthermore, ablation studies reveal the importance of incorporating different types of attention mechanisms in our model.  In summary, our work advances current research in VQA by introducing a multi-view attention-based model specifically tailored for medical applications. By utilizing multiple sources of information from the input image and leveraging innovative attention mechanisms, we achieve superior performance compared to existing approaches. This contribution paves the way for more advanced VQA systems capable of handling diverse domains and improving healthcare informatics practices.",1
"Attribute extrapolation in sample generation is challenging for deep neural networks operating beyond the training distribution. We formulate a new task for extrapolation in sequence generation, focusing on natural language and proteins, and propose GENhance, a generative framework that enhances attributes through a learned latent space. Trained on movie reviews and a computed protein stability dataset, GENhance can generate strongly-positive text reviews and highly stable protein sequences without being exposed to similar data during training. We release our benchmark tasks and models to contribute to the study of generative modeling extrapolation and data-driven design in biology and chemistry.",0
"AI language models have made significant strides in recent years due to advances in deep learning techniques and access to large datasets. However, most existing approaches rely on generation based solely on local patterns rather than exploiting high-level attributes that provide meaningful interpretations of complex scenes and interactions within them. Our approach addresses these limitations by proposing a novel methodology that utilizes attribute embedding spaces to capture rich descriptions of scene content and generate natural responses accordingly. In our experiments we demonstrate significantly improved results over baseline methods across multiple benchmark tasks while maintaining low computational overhead. This research has far reaching implications for a variety of applications including image and video synthesis as well as dialogue systems and virtual environments. Further work may expand upon this initial framework through integration into larger model architectures such as transformers which could potentially benefit from incorporating more global knowledge during inference.",1
"In this article, we present a Shell Language Preprocessing (SLP) library, which implements tokenization and encoding directed on the parsing of Unix and Linux shell commands. We describe the rationale behind the need for a new approach with specific examples when conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines fail.

"In ""Shell language processing: Unix command parsing for machine learning,"" we present a novel methodology that leverages natural language programming (NLP) techniques to parse and interpret Unix commands for machine learning applications. We argue that traditional NLP approaches have failed to fully exploit the unique characteristics of shell languages - characterized by their conciseness, flexibility, and extensibility - due to their focus on text documents rather than executable code. To address this shortcoming, our approach introduces a dedicated module responsible for handling the specific grammar, contexts, and constraints of shell scripts. This enables us to more accurately capture the semantics and intent behind each line of code while respecting its unique syntax. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed solution in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising foundation for future work in automating script development and maintenance tasks. By bridging the gap between shell languages and ML research, our study contributes to advancing the state of art in both areas while enabling new possibilities and use cases.",1
"Humans and other intelligent animals evolved highly sophisticated perception systems that combine multiple sensory modalities. On the other hand, state-of-the-art artificial agents rely mostly on visual inputs or structured low-dimensional observations provided by instrumented environments. Learning to act based on combined visual and auditory inputs is still a new topic of research that has not been explored beyond simple scenarios. To facilitate progress in this area we introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create a highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations. We study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks that require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in natural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and find that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary. We are currently in the process of merging the augmented simulator with the main ViZDoom code repository.

"In recent years there has been growing interest in developing agents capable of effectively utilizing multiple sensory systems in order to perform complex tasks. While traditional reinforcement learning algorithms have been successful in single-sensory environments, they often struggle when confronted with high degrees of multisensory complexity. This work proposes a novel approach to addressing this challenge by introducing high-throughput reinforcement learning with multiple sensory integration. By leveraging advanced techniques from computer vision, auditory processing, and natural language understanding, our proposed method enables agents to efficiently process vast amounts of sensory data while maintaining robustness across different domains and modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets spanning diverse environments such as video games, robotics, and autonomous driving simulations. These findings contribute to broader efforts aimed at building intelligent agents able to tackle real-world problems involving rich and dynamic perceptual inputs.",1
"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have come to the forefront. These systems, mostly based on Deep learning (DL), achieve excellent results in areas such as image processing, natural language processing, or speech recognition. Despite the statistically high accuracy of deep learning models, their output is often a decision of ""black box"". Thus, Interpretability methods have become a popular way to gain insight into the decision-making process of deep learning models. Explanation of a deep learning model is desirable in the medical domain since the experts have to justify their judgments to the patient. In this work, we proposed a method for explanation-guided training that uses a Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique to force the model to focus only on the relevant part of the image. We experimentally verified our method on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for low-grade and high-grade glioma classification problems. Our experiments show promising results in a way to use interpretation techniques in the model training process.",0
"Abstarct: This paper explores the use of explanation-guided training (EGT) to improve the performance of neural networks for the task of classifying gliomas in MRI brain scans. Traditional machine learning approaches have had limited success due to difficulties in obtaining large amounts of labeled data and accurately representing complex visual features of gliomas using traditional handcrafted image descriptors. However, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show great promise but often struggle to provide interpretability and understanding of their decision making process. EGT combines explainability techniques with standard backpropagation in order to optimize the parameters of CNN models so that they can make predictions which are both accurate and interpretable. In our experiments we demonstrate how EGT significantly improves accuracy over baseline models while providing more meaningful explanations for decision boundaries than gradient-based saliency maps alone. We believe these findings offer significant potential for clinical translation towards improved patient outcomes.",1
"The last decade has seen a significant increase of interest in deep learning research, with many public successes that have demonstrated its potential. As such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system improve.   The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, ""create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it"", with additional clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations.   Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent cannot be easily formalized. Besides allowing AI to solve more tasks, this can also enable more effective regulation of AI systems, as well as making progress on the value alignment problem.",0
"Abstract:  The field of reinforcement learning has seen significant advancements in recent years due to the development of new algorithms and datasets that allow agents to learn complex tasks efficiently. However, most current RL environments provide little opportunity for human feedback during training. In contrast, humans often benefit from guidance as they develop their skills, whether through mentorship, teaching, or self-reflection. This human capacity to learn from feedback may inform the design of more effective agent learning systems. We present MineRL BASALT, a competition focusing on building such learning systems by leveraging human knowledge to improve the performance of learned agents. Participants developed agents using novel techniques ranging from imitating demonstrations to optimizing based on human preferences and feedback. Our analysis of the submissions reveals insights into how different approaches can effectively leverage human feedback for improved results. Overall, our work contributes to the growing understanding of how artificial intelligence can benefit from incorporating human knowledge.",1
"Adaptive gradient methods such as RMSProp and Adam use exponential moving estimate of the squared gradient to compute adaptive step sizes, achieving better convergence than SGD in face of noisy objectives. However, Adam can have undesirable convergence behaviors due to unstable or extreme adaptive learning rates. Methods such as AMSGrad and AdaBound have been proposed to stabilize the adaptive learning rates of Adam in the later stage of training, but they do not outperform Adam in some practical tasks such as training Transformers \cite{transformer}. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning rate principle, in which the running mean of squared gradient in Adam is replaced by a weighted mean, with weights chosen to maximize the estimated variance of each coordinate. This results in a faster adaptation to the local gradient variance, which leads to more desirable empirical convergence behaviors than Adam. We prove the proposed algorithm converges under mild assumptions for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems, and demonstrate the improved efficacy of our adaptive averaging approach on machine translation, natural language understanding and large-batch pretraining of BERT. The code is available at https://github.com/zhuchen03/MaxVA.",0
"In the field of machine learning, it has become increasingly important to optimize step sizes during training as they can greatly impact model performance. However, finding the optimal step size remains challenging due to the high computational cost required for hyperparameter tuning. To address this issue, we propose a new algorithm called MaxVA that fast adapts step sizes based on the maximization of observed variance of gradients (MaxVA). By using the maximum observed variance of gradients at each epoch, our method provides a simple yet effective approach to rapidly adjusting step sizes without requiring extensive computations. Our experiments show that MaxVA significantly improves accuracy across several benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing computational overhead. This work represents a significant advancement in the development of efficient methods for optimizing step sizes and enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks.",1
"Deep learning provides a promising way to extract effective representations from raw data in an end-to-end fashion and has proven its effectiveness in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc. However, in domains such as content/product recommendation and risk management, where sequence of event data is the most used raw data form and experts derived features are more commonly used, deep learning models struggle to dominate the game. In this paper, we propose a symbolic testing framework that helps to answer the question of what kinds of expert-derived features could be learned by a neural network. Inspired by this testing framework, we introduce an efficient architecture named SHORING, which contains two components: \textit{event network} and \textit{sequence network}. The \textit{event} network learns arbitrarily yet efficiently high-order \textit{event-level} embeddings via a provable reparameterization trick, the \textit{sequence} network aggregates from sequence of \textit{event-level} embeddings. We argue that SHORING is capable of learning certain standard symbolic expressions which the standard multi-head self-attention network fails to learn, and conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on four synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets. The results show that SHORING empirically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Title: Proving Correctness of Conditionally Dependent Programs Using Symbolic Execution and Testing  Higher-order programming allows programs to call other programs as functions, enabling complex abstractions that lead to concise and reusable code. However, higher-order interactions, where one function calls another that has access to global state, pose significant challenges for proving correctness due to conditional dependencies. Existing methods struggle with high-order interaction networks (HONs) because they lack formal underpinnings or rely on incomplete tests or synthetic inputs. We present Shoring, a systematic approach that designs provably correct HONs using symbolic execution and testing techniques based on program logic. Our method can infer and check both logical properties and performance constraints for all branches of conditionals within HONs. Through evaluation on benchmark examples from various domains, we demonstrate how Shoring automatically infers conditions that eliminate spurious errors, generates efficient proof terms, handles recursive calls without increasing blowup, and discovers new bugs in existing implementations. Overall, our work advances the state of the art in automating correctness proofs for higher-order interactions and opens up promising directions for future research in verification and compiler optimizations.",1
"Braille has empowered visually challenged community to read and write. But at the same time, it has created a gap due to widespread inability of non-Braille users to understand Braille scripts. This gap has fuelled researchers to propose Optical Braille Recognition techniques to convert Braille documents to natural language. The main motivation of this work is to cement the communication gap at academic institutions by translating personal documents of blind students. This has been accomplished by proposing an economical and effective technique which digitizes Braille documents using a smartphone camera. For any given Braille image, a dot detection mechanism based on Hough transform is proposed which is invariant to skewness, noise and other deterrents. The detected dots are then clustered into Braille cells using distance-based clustering algorithm. In succession, the standard physical parameters of each Braille cells are estimated for feature extraction and classification as natural language characters. The comprehensive evaluation of this technique on the proposed dataset of 54 Braille scripts has yielded into accuracy of 98.71%.",0
"This paper presents a method for recognizing braille text using computer vision techniques. The proposed approach utilizes circular Hough transform to detect circles from the image of the braille code. These circles correspond to the bumps on the surface of the braille symbol. By extracting these circles, we can determine the corresponding character. Experimental results show that our method achieves high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our approach is robust to variations in lighting conditions and camera angles. We believe that optical recognition of braille has the potential to greatly improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals by providing fast and accurate identification of written material. Our work contributes towards realizing this goal by proposing an effective and efficient solution for recognizing braille characters through computer vision techniques.",1
"A generic video summary is an abridged version of a video that conveys the whole story and features the most important scenes. Yet the importance of scenes in a video is often subjective, and users should have the option of customizing the summary by using natural language to specify what is important to them. Further, existing models for fully automatic generic summarization have not exploited available language models, which can serve as an effective prior for saliency. This work introduces CLIP-It, a single framework for addressing both generic and query-focused video summarization, typically approached separately in the literature. We propose a language-guided multimodal transformer that learns to score frames in a video based on their importance relative to one another and their correlation with a user-defined query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense video caption (for generic video summarization). Our model can be extended to the unsupervised setting by training without ground-truth supervision. We outperform baselines and prior work by a significant margin on both standard video summarization datasets (TVSum and SumMe) and a query-focused video summarization dataset (QFVS). Particularly, we achieve large improvements in the transfer setting, attesting to our method's strong generalization capabilities.",0
"In order to summarize video content, prior work has relied heavily on manual annotations which is laborious and time consuming. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called CLIP-It!, that utilizes natural language guidance from human annotators along with pre-trained representations of image and text data. Our framework integrates state-of-the art techniques like transformers, attention mechanisms, reinforcement learning, and variational autoencoders. By incorporating linguistic knowledge into our model, we can improve the performance of the summary generation process by allowing models to better understand relationships between visual events and their corresponding natural language descriptions. Results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines across several metrics.",1
"Transformer-based models are popularly used in natural language processing (NLP). Its core component, self-attention, has aroused widespread interest. To understand the self-attention mechanism, a direct method is to visualize the attention map of a pre-trained model. Based on the patterns observed, a series of efficient Transformers with different sparse attention masks have been proposed. From a theoretical perspective, universal approximability of Transformer-based models is also recently proved. However, the above understanding and analysis of self-attention is based on a pre-trained model. To rethink the importance analysis in self-attention, we study the significance of different positions in attention matrix during pre-training. A surprising result is that diagonal elements in the attention map are the least important compared with other attention positions. We provide a proof showing that these diagonal elements can indeed be removed without deteriorating model performance. Furthermore, we propose a Differentiable Attention Mask (DAM) algorithm, which further guides the design of the SparseBERT. Extensive experiments verify our interesting findings and illustrate the effect of the proposed algorithm.",0
"This can make your summary more readable. Also use active voice instead of passive voice which would again give better readability. Try to have at least one sentence which summarizes the overall conclusion that reader may take away from the work you present in your abstract. Finally, keep in mind that any abbreviation used should be spelled out fully the first time they appear. --- SparseBERT is a method that rethinks the importance analysis in self-attention models by using a principled approach based on randomized masking and marginalization. Unlike other methods, such as Longformer, SparseBERT maintains high levels of performance while reducing memory usage during inference by up to 75%. Additionally, SparseBERT has been found to yield higher interpretability through attention heatmap visualizations compared to dense self-attention and other sparse alternatives. Overall, these findings suggest that SparseBERT could lead to improved efficiency in natural language processing tasks without sacrificing model quality.",1
"We investigate the capability of a transformer pretrained on natural language to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular, without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks. We consider such a model, which we call a Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), and study finetuning it on a variety of sequence classification tasks spanning numerical computation, vision, and protein fold prediction. In contrast to prior works which investigate finetuning on the same modality as the pretraining dataset, we show that pretraining on natural language can improve performance and compute efficiency on non-language downstream tasks. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the performance of a random initialized transformer to a random LSTM. Combining the two insights, we find language-pretrained transformers can obtain strong performance on a variety of non-language tasks.",0
"Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of using pretrained transformer models as universal computation engines, capable of performing a wide range of tasks beyond their original intended purpose of natural language processing. We demonstrate that these models can effectively learn and adapt to new task requirements without fine-tuning, outperforming traditional baseline methods in many cases. Our results suggest that pretrained transformers may have significant potential as general-purpose problem solvers, with applications across multiple domains. Finally we discuss some limitations and future directions for research on this topic.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of media retrieval using a multimodal query (a query which combines visual input with additional semantic information in natural language feedback). We propose a SynthTriplet GAN framework which resolves this task by expanding the multimodal query with a synthetically generated image that captures semantic information from both image and text input. We introduce a novel triplet mining method that uses a synthetic image as an anchor to directly optimize for embedding distances of generated and target images. We demonstrate that apart from the added value of retrieval illustration with synthetic image with the focus on customization and user feedback, the proposed method greatly surpasses other multimodal generation methods and achieves state of the art results in the multimodal retrieval task. We also show that in contrast to other retrieval methods, our method provides explainable embeddings.",0
"Title: Enhancing Search Engines through Multimodal Retrieval with Synthetic Query Expansion  Abstract: Modern search engines struggle to accurately capture user intent due to limitations in natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the inherent ambiguity of textual queries. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that utilizes multimodal data sources, such as images and videos, along with NLP methods to generate synthesized queries. These synthesized queries expand upon the original query by incorporating additional contextual information from both visual content and linguistic analysis. Our system then employs these expanded queries to perform retrieval from both image and video databases. We evaluate our method using two distinct datasets consisting of textual queries and multimedia results, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional search engine approaches. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating multimodal strategies into modern information retrieval systems.",1
"Transformers provide promising accuracy and have become popular and used in various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, due to their massive number of model parameters, memory and computation requirements, they are not suitable for resource-constrained low-power devices. Even with high-performance and specialized devices, the memory bandwidth can become a performance-limiting bottleneck. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of state-of-the-art vision transformers on several devices. We propose to reduce the overall memory footprint and memory transfers by clustering the model parameters. We show that by using only 64 clusters to represent model parameters, it is possible to reduce the data transfer from the main memory by more than 4x, achieve up to 22% speedup and 39% energy savings on mobile devices with less than 0.1% accuracy loss.",0
"In recent years, transformer models have emerged as one of the most successful architectures in natural language processing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of challenging problems such as machine translation, question answering, and text classification. However, these models often require large amounts of computational resources to train and deploy, making them impractical for use on resource-constrained devices such as smartphones and embedded systems. This work proposes several techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of transformers for resource-constrained devices without sacrificing their accuracy. We first analyze the factors that contribute to slow training times and high memory usage in transformer models, including self attention mechanisms, parallelization, and optimizations for modern hardware. Based on our analysis, we propose a set of modifications to the transformer architecture that improve its efficiency while maintaining comparable performance. Our experimental results show that these modifications significantly reduce the time required to train and evaluate transformer models on real-world datasets while requiring less memory and computing power compared to previous approaches. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of transformer models for resource-constrained devices, opening up new opportunities for natural language processing applications in areas such as edge computing and mobile computing.",1
"Transformer attention architectures, similar to those developed for natural language processing, have recently proved efficient also in vision, either in conjunction with or as a replacement for convolutional layers. Typically, visual attention is inserted in the network architecture as a (series of) feedforward self-attention module(s), with mutual key-query agreement as the main selection and routing operation. However efficient, this strategy is only vaguely compatible with the way that attention is implemented in biological brains: as a separate and unified network of attentional selection regions, receiving inputs from and exerting modulatory influence on the entire hierarchy of visual regions. Here, we report experiments with a simple such attention system that can improve the performance of standard convolutional networks, with relatively few additional parameters. Each spatial position in each layer of the network produces a key-query vector pair; all queries are then pooled into a global attention query. On the next iteration, the match between each key and the global attention query modulates the network's activations -- emphasizing or silencing the locations that agree or disagree (respectively) with the global attention system. We demonstrate the usefulness of this brain-inspired Global Attention Agreement network (GAttANet) for various convolutional backbones (from a simple 5-layer toy model to a standard ResNet50 architecture) and datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Imagenet-1k). Each time, our global attention system improves accuracy over the corresponding baseline.",0
In this study we present a novel network architecture that enables global attention agreements. These can be used as part of larger models including transformers which take into account both local and global context. We show how our method improves performance on several benchmark tasks by allowing for the integration of more complex spatio temporal relationships. Our experiments verify the effectiveness of incorporating global attention mechanisms in convolutional neural networks.,1
"Deep neural network (DNN) is a popular model implemented in many systems to handle complex tasks such as image classification, object recognition, natural language processing etc. Consequently DNN structural vulnerabilities become part of the security vulnerabilities in those systems. In this paper we study the root cause of DNN adversarial examples. We examine the DNN response surface to understand its classification boundary. Our study reveals the structural problem of DNN classification boundary that leads to the adversarial examples. Existing attack algorithms can generate from a handful to a few hundred adversarial examples given one clean image. We show there are infinitely many adversarial images given one clean sample, all within a small neighborhood of the clean sample. We then define DNN uncertainty regions and show transferability of adversarial examples is not universal. We also argue that generalization error, the large sample theoretical guarantee established for DNN, cannot adequately capture the phenomenon of adversarial examples. We need new theory to measure DNN robustness.",0
"Abstract: This research explores adversarial examples in deep neural networks by analyzing the response surface and uncertainty regions. The goal is to gain insight into how these types of inputs can cause misclassifications and why they are challenging to detect. By studying the behavior of the network on both benign and adversarial examples, we hope to develop methods that can better defend against attacks and improve model robustness. Our work demonstrates how the response surface and uncertainty regions differ between benign and adversarial examples and provides new perspectives on understanding their impact on deep learning systems.

"Deep Learning (DL) is considered the state-of-the-art in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Until recently, it was also widely accepted that DL is irrelevant for learning tasks on tabular data, especially in the small sample regime where ensemble methods are acknowledged as the gold standard. We present a new end-to-end differentiable method to train a standard FFNN. Our method, \textbf{Muddling labels for Regularization} (\texttt{MLR}), penalizes memorization through the generation of uninformative labels and the application of a differentiable close-form regularization scheme on the last hidden layer during training. \texttt{MLR} outperforms classical NN and the gold standard (GBDT, RF) for regression and classification tasks on several datasets from the UCI database and Kaggle covering a large range of sample sizes and feature to sample ratios. Researchers and practitioners can use \texttt{MLR} on its own as an off-the-shelf \DL{} solution or integrate it into the most advanced ML pipelines.",0
"""Tabular datasets are commonly used in many fields such as finance, medicine, and ecology. Traditional machine learning methods have been applied on these tabular data but deep learning has proven to provide better performance than traditional techniques like Random Forest and Logistic Regression. However, there are challenges associated with applying deep learning models to these high dimensional tables. One major challenge arises from the limited number of samples available for training due to which overfitting occurs, leading to poor generalization of the model. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a method called Muddling Label Regularization (MLR). MLR employs two techniques: the first technique involves adding noise to the labels while regularizing the activation functions of each layer based on their ability to resist noise propagation throughout the network. This approach leads to less pruning of weights during backpropagation and allows the model to learn more robust representations that can generalize better under small sample sizes. We demonstrate our proposed framework by experimenting with several benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the art results compared to other existing approaches.""",1
"Self-supervised contrastive representation learning has proved incredibly successful in the vision and natural language domains, enabling state-of-the-art performance with orders of magnitude less labeled data. However, such methods are domain-specific and little has been done to leverage this technique on real-world tabular datasets. We propose SCARF, a simple, widely-applicable technique for contrastive learning, where views are formed by corrupting a random subset of features. When applied to pre-train deep neural networks on the 69 real-world, tabular classification datasets from the OpenML-CC18 benchmark, SCARF not only improves classification accuracy in the fully-supervised setting but does so also in the presence of label noise and in the semi-supervised setting where only a fraction of the available training data is labeled. We show that SCARF complements existing strategies and outperforms alternatives like autoencoders. We conduct comprehensive ablations, detailing the importance of a range of factors.",0
"In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful approach for training deep neural networks without relying on annotated data. One popular method is contrastive learning, which involves maximizing agreement between positive pairs (e.g., two views of the same image) while minimizing agreement between negative pairs (two different images). However, existing methods still have limitations, such as vulnerability to trivial solutions like color jittering and insufficient robustness against random corruptions.  To address these issues, we propose a new method called SCARF (Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Fine-Tuning), based on contrastive learning and feature augmentations that are specifically designed to create challenging but meaningful perturbations to input data. Our key contributions can be summarized as follows:  * We introduce random feature corruption techniques for generating difficult yet informative augmentations, ensuring that both the pretraining step and downstream task benefit from stronger generalization ability. Specifically, we investigate three types of corruptions (additive noise, blur, and aspect ratio changes) and develop principles guiding their proper use during both pretraining and fine-tuning stages. * Experimentally, our proposed SCARF method surpasses state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets and architectures (including ImageNet, ClutteredCOCO, and Vistas) for tasks involving image classification and object detection. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and complementarity of each component within our framework. * Finally, by utilizing real-world applications (semantic segmentation on PASCAL Context, panoptic segmentation on Cityscapes, and COCO object detection) along with synthetic datasets commonly used in academic evaluations, we offer comprehensive evidence that SCARF indeed learns superior representations enabling strong performance on diverse evaluation protocols beyond the simple image classification setting.

This paper describes a novel multimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document classification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to train hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training process. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document database and trained the model for classifying documents based on the hierarchical International Patent Classification system.

"Transformer, which can benefit from global (long-range) information modeling using self-attention mechanisms, has been successful in natural language processing and 2D image classification recently. However, both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we for the first time exploit Transformer in 3D CNN for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation and propose a novel network named TransBTS based on the encoder-decoder structure. To capture the local 3D context information, the encoder first utilizes 3D CNN to extract the volumetric spatial feature maps. Meanwhile, the feature maps are reformed elaborately for tokens that are fed into Transformer for global feature modeling. The decoder leverages the features embedded by Transformer and performs progressive upsampling to predict the detailed segmentation map. Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that TransBTS achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art 3D methods for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans.

"Current vision and language tasks usually take complete visual data (e.g., raw images or videos) as input, however, practical scenarios may often consist the situations where part of the visual information becomes inaccessible due to various reasons e.g., restricted view with fixed camera or intentional vision block for security concerns. As a step towards the more practical application scenarios, we introduce a novel task that aims to describe a video using the natural language dialog between two agents as a supplementary information source given incomplete visual data. Different from most existing vision-language tasks where AI systems have full access to images or video clips, which may reveal sensitive information such as recognizable human faces or voices, we intentionally limit the visual input for AI systems and seek a more secure and transparent information medium, i.e., the natural language dialog, to supplement the missing visual information. Specifically, one of the intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two semantic segmented frames from the beginning and the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities to ask relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video. A-BOT, the other agent who has access to the entire video, assists Q-BOT to accomplish the goal by answering the asked questions. We introduce two different experimental settings with either a generative (i.e., agents generate questions and answers freely) or a discriminative (i.e., agents select the questions and answers from candidates) internal dialog generation process. With the proposed unified QA-Cooperative networks, we experimentally demonstrate the knowledge transfer process between the two dialog agents and the effectiveness of using the natural language dialog as a supplement for incomplete implicit visions.",0
"This paper introduces the concept of using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to create artificial intelligence that can generate video descriptions for blind individuals. We propose a novel approach called ""dialog agents"" which involves training these systems on large datasets of human generated descriptive text. Our experiments show that our method produces highly accurate descriptions that accurately convey key details such as objects, actions, emotions, and context. In addition, we demonstrate how the use of NLP enables more complex reasoning tasks such as identifying and describing multiple events happening simultaneously in a scene, interpreting and explaining metaphors, similes and figurative expressions commonly found in descriptive narratives. Overall, our work represents a major step forward towards creating intelligent assistants capable of generating high quality descriptions of videos and enhancing accessibility for millions of visually impaired users worldwide.",1
"When tuning the architecture and hyperparameters of large machine learning models for on-device deployment, it is desirable to understand the optimal trade-offs between on-device latency and model accuracy. In this work, we leverage recent methodological advances in Bayesian optimization over high-dimensional search spaces and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore these trade-offs for a production-scale on-device natural language understanding model at Facebook.",0
"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, there is growing interest in developing techniques that can optimize their performance across multiple dimensions. One important aspect of AI system performance is latency, or how quickly they respond to inputs and produce outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called ""Latency-aware neural architecture search with multi-objective Bayesian optimization"" which addresses this challenge by leveraging recent advances in probabilistic programming languages like PyMC3 and Probabilistic Programming Language(PPL). Our method uses these tools to model the relationship between hyperparameters controlling different components of the AI system, such as number of neurons per layer, depth of network stacks and width of networks, and predicted performance metrics including accuracy and latency. This allows us to perform efficient global searches over this high-dimensional parameter space using Bayesian optimization methods that balance the competing objectives of minimizing latency while maximizing performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on several benchmark datasets and show that it consistently finds models with better tradeoffs between latency and accuracy compared to prior state-of-the art approaches. Overall, this work represents an important step towards enabling AI developers to build more responsive and efficient systems that meet the diverse needs of users in real world settings.",1
"This work improves the quality of automated machine learning (AutoML) systems by using dataset and function descriptions while significantly decreasing computation time from minutes to milliseconds by using a zero-shot approach. Given a new dataset and a well-defined machine learning task, humans begin by reading a description of the dataset and documentation for the algorithms to be used. This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call privileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to process the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information improves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide a significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual descriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification performance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves classification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a graph neural network with these description embeddings and the data meta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict the best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot fashion. Our zero-shot approach rapidly predicts a high-quality pipeline for a supervised learning task and dataset. In contrast, most AutoML systems require tens or hundreds of pipeline evaluations. We show that zero-shot AutoML reduces running and prediction times from minutes to milliseconds, consistently across datasets. By speeding up AutoML by orders of magnitude this work demonstrates real-time AutoML.",0
"Machine Learning (ML) automation tools make the model training process more efficient by taking care of several tasks such as data preprocessing, model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Although there have been significant advances in Automatic ML (AutoML), most current approaches still require considerable human intervention in order to set up the infrastructure, design the pipelines and interpret their results. In our work, we propose a new methodology called ""Privileged Zero-shot AutoML"" that combines unsupervised machine learning techniques with existing AutoML frameworks to achieve zero- shot automatic deployment on any dataset without prior knowledge or fine-tuning. Our approach leverages transfer learning from natural language processing to automatically infer informative feature representations which further allows it to perform well across multiple datasets. We evaluate our approach on a range of classification tasks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other widely used AutoML methods while requiring significantly less computational resources. With the growth of big data, it has become increasingly important to develop scalable solutions for handling large scale ML tasks. Our work takes us one step closer towards fully autonomous ML systems, where even end users can generate models without extensive domain expertise.",1
"Recently, transformers have shown great superiority in solving computer vision tasks by modeling images as a sequence of manually-split patches with self-attention mechanism. However, current architectures of vision transformers (ViTs) are simply inherited from natural language processing (NLP) tasks and have not been sufficiently investigated and optimized. In this paper, we make a further step by examining the intrinsic structure of transformers for vision tasks and propose an architecture search method, dubbed ViTAS, to search for the optimal architecture with similar hardware budgets. Concretely, we design a new effective yet efficient weight sharing paradigm for ViTs, such that architectures with different token embedding, sequence size, number of heads, width, and depth can be derived from a single super-transformer. Moreover, to cater for the variance of distinct architectures, we introduce \textit{private} class token and self-attention maps in the super-transformer. In addition, to adapt the searching for different budgets, we propose to search the sampling probability of identity operation. Experimental results show that our ViTAS attains excellent results compared to existing pure transformer architectures. For example, with $1.3$G FLOPs budget, our searched architecture achieves $74.7\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet and is $2.5\%$ superior than the current baseline ViT architecture. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/xiusu/ViTAS}.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress made by computer vision models like ResNet (He et al., 2016) , DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), U-Net (Ronneberger et al ., 2015 ), SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017 ) etc which can handle large scale datasets such as Image Net (Deng et al., 2009) but they still suffer from slow inference speed due to their complex architectures. To address these issues Vision Transformers have been proposed which show promise in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency (ViT(Vaswani et al., 2020)). Various works exploring Vision Transformer architecture search (Chen et al. , 2021; Wong et al. ,2021 ; Zhuge et al. , 2021) demonstrate that it's possible to find new ViT variants superior in performance than those hand designed ones. They use Neural Network architecture search methods like Random Search(RS)( Bauer et al . , 2019 ) , Evolutionary Strategies (ES)(Real et al . , 2018 ; Li et al. , 2021a) etc in order to conduct extensive studies on architecture space of Vision Transformers however it remains unclear what insights we gain if these approaches continue to explore larger search spaces. Additionally despite recent advances the process of searching for novel network topologies remain computationally expensive. This paper contributes a more effective search methodology which addresses these challenges with respect to efficient exploration in larger search spaces. We focus primarily on Evolutionary Methods due to their success seen in previous research (Yeung at al. , 2021). Since the model population size scales quadratically with the number of parameters , direct scaling up of existing methods is often prohibitive which leads us to propose ""Progressive Population Size Reduction"" (PPSR) - a pruning based technique used to reduce the population size throughout evolution while preserving the necessary representational capacity to maintain good performance . Secondly to accelerate the search process in large search spac",1
"Breakthroughs in machine learning in the last decade have led to `digital intelligence', i.e. machine learning models capable of learning from vast amounts of labeled data to perform several digital tasks such as speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation and so on. The goal of this thesis is to make progress towards designing algorithms capable of `physical intelligence', i.e. building intelligent autonomous navigation agents capable of learning to perform complex navigation tasks in the physical world involving visual perception, natural language understanding, reasoning, planning, and sequential decision making. Despite several advances in classical navigation methods in the last few decades, current navigation agents struggle at long-term semantic navigation tasks. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss our work on short-term navigation using end-to-end reinforcement learning to tackle challenges such as obstacle avoidance, semantic perception, language grounding, and reasoning. In the second part, we present a new class of navigation methods based on modular learning and structured explicit map representations, which leverage the strengths of both classical and end-to-end learning methods, to tackle long-term navigation tasks. We show that these methods are able to effectively tackle challenges such as localization, mapping, long-term planning, exploration and learning semantic priors. These modular learning methods are capable of long-term spatial and semantic understanding and achieve state-of-the-art results on various navigation tasks.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to building intelligent autonomous navigation agents. Current methods rely heavily on machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning and computer vision algorithms which often require large amounts of data to train accurate models. These approaches can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well across different environments. Our proposed method uses a symbolic reasoning system that allows the agent to plan and reason about its environment using high level representations. This results in a more flexible and interpretable solution compared to traditional black box neural network based systems. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark scenarios and show that our system outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. ---  Introduction: Autonomous navigation has become an increasingly important problem over recent years due to advances in robotics, drones, and self driving cars. These applications require highly precise and efficient motion planning solutions to navigate through complex real world environments safely and efficiently. Recently there have been significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) especially within deep learning and machine learning subfields which provide promising solutions. However these approaches suffer from some limitations in term of explainability and lack of generalization capabilities across different domains, tasks, and environments. In this work we introduce an alternative AI based approach for solving intelligent navigation problems. Instead of relying solely on classical machine learning paradigms like supervised or unsupervised learning; we present a hybrid symbolic reasoning and planning framework inspired by philosophy of mind literature known as cognitive architectures. Cognitive architecture provides principled ways for understanding how human minds process information, solve problems, and make decisions. By modeling after human cognition principles we aim to create adaptive agents capable of tackling novel situations without explicitly requiring vast amount of training data or fine tuned hyperparameters. Additionally we aspire to design agents whose decision making processes are transparent to engineers enabling better control and explanation. To validate this approach w",1
"Twitter is a useful resource to analyze peoples' opinions on various topics. Often these topics are correlated or associated with locations from where these Tweet posts are made. For example, restaurant owners may need to know where their target customers eat with respect to the sentiment of the posts made related to food, policy planners may need to analyze citizens' opinion on relevant issues such as crime, safety, congestion, etc. with respect to specific parts of the city, or county or state. As promising as this is, less than $1\%$ of the crawled Tweet posts come with geolocation tags. That makes accurate prediction of Tweet posts for the non geo-tagged tweets very critical to analyze data in various domains. In this research, we utilized millions of Twitter posts and end-users domain expertise to build a set of deep neural network models using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, that predicts the geolocation of non geo-tagged Tweet posts at various level of granularities such as neighborhood, zipcode, and longitude with latitudes. With multiple neural architecture experiments, and a collaborative human-machine workflow design, our ongoing work on geolocation detection shows promising results that empower end-users to correlate relationship between variables of choice with the location information.",0
"Title: Enhancing Twitter Geolocation Accuracy through Collaborative Approaches  Twitter has become an essential platform for sharing real-time updates on events, news, opinions, and experiences worldwide. With billions of tweets posted daily, extracting location data from user posts can provide valuable insights into emerging trends, public sentiments, and social behavior patterns across different regions. Despite advances in natural language processing (NLP) techniques that support geolocation prediction, their accuracy remains limited by varying factors such as user ambiguity, contextual discrepancies, and dynamic human behaviors. This study presents a novel approach towards enhancing fine-grained geolocation prediction accuracy using human-machine collaboration. Our methodology integrates machine learning algorithms with crowdsourced feedback from human annotators who validate and refine predicted locations based on their local knowledge, cultural understanding, and domain expertise. We propose a hybrid model that balances automation efficiency with human intuition, addressing both recall and precision issues in conventional NLP systems. Results obtained demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods and other state-of-the-art solutions while highlighting the advantages of our proposed collaborative framework. This work provides new perspectives and potential applications in areas such as social media analytics, crisis response, urban planning, market research, and many more. By merging the complementary strengths of machines and humans, we pave the way for enhanced geolocation analysis and improved decision making in diverse fields.",1
"Causality knowledge is vital to building robust AI systems. Deep learning models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However, there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models (BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.",0
"In today's world, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have made significant strides in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, there remains a critical gap in their ability to reason and make decisions based on commonsense knowledge. This paper presents ""iReason,"" a novel approach that utilizes videos and natural language data along with interpretability techniques to enable multimodal commonsense reasoning. Our framework uses a combination of generative models, deep learning architectures, and attention mechanisms to encode visual features from video frames and align them with natural language descriptions. We then leverage these aligned representations to perform various types of reasoning tasks such as question answering, inference making, and decision support. Finally, we provide analysis and insights into our model architecture and performance through interpretability methods like feature attribution and layerwise relevance propagation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets while providing explainability and transparency. With iReason, we aim to bridge the gap between computer vision and natural language processing, enabling AI systems to comprehend complex scenarios and interact more naturally with humans.",1
"Initially developed for natural language processing (NLP), Transformers are now widely used for source code processing, due to the format similarity between source code and text. In contrast to natural language, source code is strictly structured, i.e., it follows the syntax of the programming language. Several recent works develop Transformer modifications for capturing syntactic information in source code. The drawback of these works is that they do not compare to each other and consider different tasks. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical study of the capabilities of Transformers to utilize syntactic information in different tasks. We consider three tasks (code completion, function naming and bug fixing) and re-implement different syntax-capturing modifications in a unified framework. We show that Transformers are able to make meaningful predictions based purely on syntactic information and underline the best practices of taking the syntactic information into account for improving the performance of the model.",0
"This should summarize the main points of your paper. Your reader can always access more details from your paper if necessary. Make sure you cover: goal, methodology, results, conclusions drawn, implications (if any) The goal of the paper was to study transformer models used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, question answering, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments on several datasets using different variants of transformer models such as BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa to compare their performance across different NLP tasks. Our findings indicate that transformer models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on most benchmarks tested. Moreover, we observed that RoBERTa yields consistently better results compared to other models for code generation tasks. Finally, our work highlights the potential applicability of pre-trained transformer models for improving software development processes through automation, which has significant implications for reducing time and costs associated with manual code reviews.",1
"Transformers recently are adapted from the community of natural language processing as a promising substitute of convolution-based neural networks for visual learning tasks. However, its supremacy degenerates given an insufficient amount of training data (e.g., ImageNet). To make it into practical utility, we propose a novel distillation-based method to train vision transformers. Unlike previous works, where merely heavy convolution-based teachers are provided, we introduce lightweight teachers with different architectural inductive biases (e.g., convolution and involution) to co-advise the student transformer. The key is that teachers with different inductive biases attain different knowledge despite that they are trained on the same dataset, and such different knowledge compounds and boosts the student's performance during distillation. Equipped with this cross inductive bias distillation method, our vision transformers (termed as CivT) outperform all previous transformers of the same architecture on ImageNet.",0
"In a world where machine learning models have become increasingly complex, there has been growing interest in developing new techniques that can distil knowledge from large scale language data so as to improve model performance across different languages and tasks without overfitting on any one specific dataset. Our work introduces co-advising—a framework that exploits the interaction between multiple student models to create a teacher model capable of effectively guiding their training. We demonstrate how to explicitly encourage cross inductive bias distillation among students during co-training by leveraging their complementary strengths and limitations while mitigating potential negative effects through selectively applied weight penalties. Experiments show significant improvements compared to traditional single-student distillation settings, including stronger zero-shot generalization capabilities across unseen languages. We hope our findings inspire future research into more advanced methods of multi-task learning beyond standard setups involving only pairs of teachers and students, since such systems may prove crucial for advancing state-of-the-art NLP models towards real-world applicability on diverse linguistic domains.",1
"Automatic code synthesis from natural language descriptions is a challenging task. We witness massive progress in developing code generation systems for domain-specific languages (DSLs) employing sequence-to-sequence deep learning techniques in the recent past. In this paper, we specifically experiment with \textsc{AlgoLisp} DSL-based generative models and showcase the existence of significant dataset bias through different classes of adversarial examples. We also experiment with two variants of Transformer-based models that outperform all existing \textsc{AlgoLisp} DSL-based code generation baselines. Consistent with the current state-of-the-art systems, our proposed models, too, achieve poor performance under adversarial settings. Therefore, we propose several dataset augmentation techniques to reduce bias and showcase their efficacy using robust experimentation.",0
"Automatic code generation has become increasingly popular as more companies seek out ways to reduce manual coding efforts while maintaining high quality outputs. However, one major concern associated with using automatic code generators is their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated that malicious inputs can easily fool many state-of-the-art code generation models into producing harmful code. This work seeks to address this issue by proposing novel techniques for improving the robustness of synthetic code generation models against such attacks. We begin by presenting a comprehensive analysis of existing approaches used to augment code generators' resilience to attacks, highlighting their limitations and drawbacks. Next, we introduce our new methods based on deep learning architectures that effectively detect and mitigate input perturbations, ensuring safe and reliable synthesized code. Our extensive evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to other well-known systems. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward towards making automated code generation technology safer and more secure for real-world applications.",1
"Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithms are extensively utilized in modern data science, and seek to partition the dataset into clusters while generating a hierarchical relationship between the data samples. HAC algorithms are employed in many applications, such as biology, natural language processing, and recommender systems. Thus, it is imperative to ensure that these algorithms are fair -- even if the dataset contains biases against certain protected groups, the cluster outputs generated should not discriminate against samples from any of these groups. However, recent work in clustering fairness has mostly focused on center-based clustering algorithms, such as k-median and k-means clustering. In this paper, we propose fair algorithms for performing HAC that enforce fairness constraints 1) irrespective of the distance linkage criteria used, 2) generalize to any natural measures of clustering fairness for HAC, 3) work for multiple protected groups, and 4) have competitive running times to vanilla HAC. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world UCI datasets, we show that our proposed algorithm finds fairer clusterings compared to vanilla HAC as well as other state-of-the-art fair clustering approaches.",0
"One of the fundamental challenges facing machine learning is creating algorithms that can learn from data while remaining fair and unbiased. This task becomes even more difficult when dealing with hierarchical agglomerative clustering, where the goal is to group similar items together based on their similarity. Traditional methods often struggle with accurately identifying clusters that are both statistically significant and inclusive of underrepresented groups. In our work, we present a novel approach to hierarchical agglomerative clustering using fairness constraints. We demonstrate how these constraints lead to improved cluster validity and reduced bias by evaluating them against several benchmark datasets. Our findings show that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of accuracy, diversity, and equitability. Ultimately, our work provides a new framework for constructing fairer and more representative models for clustering analysis.",1
"Pruning is an effective method to reduce the memory footprint and FLOPs associated with neural network models. However, existing structured-pruning methods often result in significant accuracy degradation for moderate pruning levels. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hessian Aware Pruning (HAP) method coupled with a Neural Implant approach that uses second-order sensitivity as a metric for structured pruning. The basic idea is to prune insensitive components and to use a Neural Implant for moderately sensitive components, instead of completely pruning them. For the latter approach, the moderately sensitive components are replaced with with a low rank implant that is smaller and less computationally expensive than the original component. We use the relative Hessian trace to measure sensitivity, as opposed to the magnitude based sensitivity metric commonly used in the literature. We test HAP for both computer vision tasks and natural language tasks, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results. Specifically, HAP achieves less than $0.1\%$/$0.5\%$ degradation on PreResNet29/ResNet50 (CIFAR-10/ImageNet) with more than 70\%/50\% of parameters pruned. Meanwhile, HAP also achieves significantly better performance (up to 0.8\% with 60\% of parameters pruned) as compared to gradient based method for head pruning on transformer-based models. The framework has been open sourced and available online.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing efficient pruning techniques that can remove redundant or unimportant neurons from deep neural networks (DNNs) while minimizing loss in accuracy. One promising approach to achieve this goal involves identifying critical connections or neurons using Hessians, which provide a measure of how sensitive the network output is to changes in input patterns. However, current state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on using fixed threshold values or heuristics to select important connections based on their corresponding Hessian values. These approaches often result in suboptimal performance as they do not take into account the relationship between different neurons in a DNN nor optimize pruning directly. This work proposes a novel algorithm that performs optimal neural implant by jointly optimizing connection selection and retraining the remaining network after pruning, using dynamic programming to search over all possible combinations of retained neurons. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy recovery and model size reduction across a range of benchmark datasets and architectures. Our findings showcase the effectiveness of Hessian-aware optimization in creating more compact and accurate DNN models with minimal human intervention.",1
"As soon as abstract mathematical computations were adapted to computation on digital computers, the problem of efficient representation, manipulation, and communication of the numerical values in those computations arose. Strongly related to the problem of numerical representation is the problem of quantization: in what manner should a set of continuous real-valued numbers be distributed over a fixed discrete set of numbers to minimize the number of bits required and also to maximize the accuracy of the attendant computations? This perennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory and/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the forefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network models in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas. Moving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer values represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the memory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x to 8x are often realized in practice in these applications. Thus, it is not surprising that quantization has emerged recently as an important and very active sub-area of research in the efficient implementation of computations associated with Neural Networks. In this article, we survey approaches to the problem of quantizing the numerical values in deep Neural Network computations, covering the advantages/disadvantages of current methods. With this survey and its organization, we hope to have presented a useful snapshot of the current research in quantization for Neural Networks and to have given an intelligent organization to ease the evaluation of future research in this area.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have led to a significant increase in model complexity, which has resulted in longer inference times and higher computational requirements. To address these issues, researchers have proposed quantization methods that enable efficient neural network inference on devices with limited hardware resources. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of existing quantization techniques used for accelerating neural network inferencing while minimizing loss in accuracy. We focus on several aspects such as bitwidth reduction techniques, tensor factorizations, pruning approaches, knowledge distillation, mixed precision, and depth scaling. Moreover, we analyze the trade-offs involved in employing different quantization strategies according to various performance metrics such as latency, energy consumption, memory footprint, and quality of service. Our evaluation shows that appropriate selection of quantization schemes can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup without significantly sacrificing model fidelity for a wide range of applications like image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss future directions in quantization research by highlighting promising areas including dynamic quantization, meta learning, and continual quantization adaptation. By providing detailed insights into current state-of-the art quantization techniques, our work serves as a valuable resource for both practitioners and researchers working in the field of machine learning deployment on edge computing devices.",1
"Transfer learning with pre-training on large-scale datasets has played an increasingly significant role in computer vision and natural language processing recently. However, as there exist numerous application scenarios that have distinctive demands such as certain latency constraints and specialized data distributions, it is prohibitively expensive to take advantage of large-scale pre-training for per-task requirements. In this paper, we focus on the area of object detection and present a transfer learning system named GAIA, which could automatically and efficiently give birth to customized solutions according to heterogeneous downstream needs. GAIA is capable of providing powerful pre-trained weights, selecting models that conform to downstream demands such as latency constraints and specified data domains, and collecting relevant data for practitioners who have very few datapoints for their tasks. With GAIA, we achieve promising results on COCO, Objects365, Open Images, Caltech, CityPersons, and UODB which is a collection of datasets including KITTI, VOC, WiderFace, DOTA, Clipart, Comic, and more. Taking COCO as an example, GAIA is able to efficiently produce models covering a wide range of latency from 16ms to 53ms, and yields AP from 38.2 to 46.5 without whistles and bells. To benefit every practitioner in the community of object detection, GAIA is released at https://github.com/GAIA-vision.",0
"Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) systems aimed at object detection are becoming more specialized and tailored toward specific applications, rather than attempting to perform well across all use cases.

To address this challenge, we propose GAIA, a transfer learning system designed to rapidly generate high-quality object detectors that meet user-specified requirements while minimizing computational costs. By leveraging existing knowledge from pre-trained deep neural networks and allowing for fine-grained control over model architecture, training data, and hyperparameters, GAIA enables researchers and developers to create accurate object detectors suited to their unique needs. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach across various domains, making GAIA an attractive option for anyone seeking efficient, personalized object detection solutions. Ultimately, by bridging the gap between off-the-shelf methods and fully-custom approaches, GAIA empowers users to tackle complex tasks without sacrificing performance or affordability.",1
"Unsupervised domain adaptation is used in many machine learning applications where, during training, a model has access to unlabeled data in the target domain, and a related labeled dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel and general domain-adversarial framework. Specifically, we derive a novel generalization bound for domain adaptation that exploits a new measure of discrepancy between distributions based on a variational characterization of f-divergences. It recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David et al. (2010a) as a special case and supports divergences used in practice. Based on this bound, we derive a new algorithmic framework that introduces a key correction in the original adversarial training method of Ganin et al. (2016). We show that many regularizers and ad-hoc objectives introduced over the last years in this framework are then not required to achieve performance comparable to (if not better than) state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods. Experimental analysis conducted on real-world natural language and computer vision datasets show that our framework outperforms existing baselines, and obtains the best results for f-divergences that were not considered previously in domain-adversarial learning.",0
"This paper presents a comprehensive study on f-domain adversarial learning (fDAL), addressing both theoretical foundations and algorithmic developments. We begin by introducing the concept of fDAL as a novel framework that incorporates domain knowledge into adversarial training, enabling models to learn more robust representations under distribution shifts. Our analysis demonstrates how fDAL bridges the gap between distribution shift detection and mitigation, leading to state-of-the-art performance across benchmark datasets and real-world applications. The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: (i) we present a detailed theoretical treatment of fDAL, clarifying its relationship with existing methods from the literature; (ii) we devise efficient algorithms for solving the key optimization problems underlying fDAL; (iii) we conduct extensive experimental evaluations comparing fDAL against several baseline approaches using challenging benchmarks, reporting consistent improvements over competitors. Collectively, these results establish fDAL as an effective methodology for building resilient machine learning systems able to operate reliably in dynamic environments. With this work, we aim to encourage further research efforts towards uncovering new insights into domain adaptation, shedding light onto longstanding open questions at the heart of Artificial Intelligence.",1
"Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of important innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces layoutparser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applications. The core layoutparser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout detection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, layoutparser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digitization pipelines.

"Recently introduced self-supervised methods for image representation learning provide on par or superior results to their fully supervised competitors, yet the corresponding efforts to explain the self-supervised approaches lag behind. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel visual probing framework for explaining the self-supervised models by leveraging probing tasks employed previously in natural language processing. The probing tasks require knowledge about semantic relationships between image parts. Hence, we propose a systematic approach to obtain analogs of natural language in vision, such as visual words, context, and taxonomy. Our proposal is grounded in Marr's computational theory of vision and concerns features like textures, shapes, and lines. We show the effectiveness and applicability of those analogs in the context of explaining self-supervised representations. Our key findings emphasize that relations between language and vision can serve as an effective yet intuitive tool for discovering how machine learning models work, independently of data modality. Our work opens a plethora of research pathways towards more explainable and transparent AI.",0

Do not include the paper title in the abstract. Do not start with the word ""This"". Title: ""Visual Probing: Cognitive Framework for Explaining Self-Supervised Image Representations""  Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a popular approach for training deep neural networks on large amounts of unlabeled data. However, one major challenge facing these models is their lack of interpretability - we often don’t know why they make certain predictions, or how their representations encode meaningful concepts. This gap between model performance and human understanding can limit applications in critical areas such as healthcare and autonomous systems. Our work addresses this problem by introducing Visual Probing (VP), a framework that enables us to query pretrained image representations using natural language prompts, generating real-time explanations that highlight relevant features across layers and regions. We show through extensive experiments that VP provides insights into state-of-the-art models like CLIP and DALL-E2, facilitating comparison against other methods, interpretation of visualizations produced by them, generation of novel examples and outlier detection. Overall, our contributions aim towards developing practical tools and techniques that bring transparency to complex models trained on millions of images. Our goal is to empower researchers and practitioners working with vision technologies, enabling better decision making grounded in human cognition. Less",1
"Deep Learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision, natural language understanding, speech recognition, information retrieval and more. However, with the progressive improvements in deep learning models, their number of parameters, latency, resources required to train, etc. have all have increased significantly. Consequently, it has become important to pay attention to these footprint metrics of a model as well, not just its quality. We present and motivate the problem of efficiency in deep learning, followed by a thorough survey of the five core areas of model efficiency (spanning modeling techniques, infrastructure, and hardware) and the seminal work there. We also present an experiment-based guide along with code, for practitioners to optimize their model training and deployment. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey in the efficient deep learning space that covers the landscape of model efficiency from modeling techniques to hardware support. Our hope is that this survey would provide the reader with the mental model and the necessary understanding of the field to apply generic efficiency techniques to immediately get significant improvements, and also equip them with ideas for further research and experimentation to achieve additional gains.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results in numerous domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and robotics. However, one major challenge facing the field is the large computational requirements and time constraints associated with training these models, particularly for larger and more complex models. To address this issue, there have been several efforts aimed at making deep learning models smaller (by reducing model complexity), faster (through improved optimization techniques) and better (in terms of accuracy). This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape on efficient deep learning, including advancements in network architecture design, regularization methods, transfer learning, distributed computing, mixed precision and hardware acceleration. We highlight key challenges faced by practitioners working in the area, along with their corresponding solutions, and provide insights into promising future directions for research in this rapidly evolving domain.",1
"We propose a method for efficiently incorporating constraints into a stochastic gradient Langevin framework for the training of deep neural networks. Constraints allow direct control of the parameter space of the model. Appropriately designed, they reduce the vanishing/exploding gradient problem, control weight magnitudes and stabilize deep neural networks and thus improve the robustness of training algorithms and the generalization capabilities of the trained neural network. We present examples of constrained training methods motivated by orthogonality preservation for weight matrices and explicit weight normalizations. We describe the methods in the overdamped formulation of Langevin dynamics and the underdamped form, in which momenta help to improve sampling efficiency. The methods are explored in test examples in image classification and natural language processing.",0
"In order to address overfitting issues prevalent in deep neural networks, several methods such as dropout and weight decay have been proposed. However, these methods lack interpretability and fail to leverage domain knowledge available from constraints such as monotonicity and non-negativity. To fill this gap, we propose Constraint-Based Regularization (CBR), which explicitly enforces known physical or mathematical properties using first derivative regularization terms integrated into the optimization process. CBR yields better generalization performance than traditional methods on benchmark datasets without any architectural modifications and can even surpass the accuracy achieved by DropConnect and Randomized Gaussians with equivalent parameters and computational cost. Moreover, CBR exhibits higher robustness against input perturbations compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, making it more suitable for deployment in safety-critical applications such as medical imaging analysis and autonomous driving perception systems. Finally, our analysis shows that CBR leads to solutions closer to a globally optimal decision boundary while preserving their smoothness, thus providing more meaningful insights into the predictions of neural networks.",1
"Compositional generalization is the ability to generalize systematically to a new data distribution by combining known components. Although humans seem to have a great ability to generalize compositionally, state-of-the-art neural models struggle to do so. In this work, we study compositional generalization in classification tasks and present two main contributions. First, we study ways to convert a natural language sequence-to-sequence dataset to a classification dataset that also requires compositional generalization. Second, we show that providing structural hints (specifically, providing parse trees and entity links as attention masks for a Transformer model) helps compositional generalization.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has shown great success in solving complex tasks such as image classification. However, many models still suffer from poor compositional generalization, which means they struggle to recognize objects that appear in novel combinations or arrangements. One possible solution to this problem is to use structure annotations, which provide explicit information about object relationships within images. This paper investigates the effectiveness of using structure annotations on two widely used benchmark datasets: CUB200-2011 and Pascal VOC. Our results show that incorporating these annotations leads to significant improvements in model performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without annotations by large margins. Additionally, we explore different ways of integrating these annotations into the training process and propose new evaluation metrics tailored specifically for assessing compositional generalization. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential impact of structured knowledge on improving computer vision systems and highlights promising directions for future research.",1
"Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have recently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation underlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e. words or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the local interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long sequences and high-resolution images. We propose a ""transposed"" version of self-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where the interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and queries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity in the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution images. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It combines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of convolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of XCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including image classification and self-supervised feature learning on ImageNet-1k, object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20k.",0
"Image transformer architectures have become increasingly popular due to their ability to model long range dependencies in sequence data, resulting in state-of-the-art results across many computer vision tasks. However, these models suffer from two major drawbacks: they lack direct support for cross-correlation modelling and require large amounts of computational resources due to their sequential nature. To address these issues, we introduce XCiT (Cross-covariance Image Transformer), a novel architecture that enables efficient computation of cross-correlations within images by factorizing them into smaller local correlations that can be computed using self-attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that our method outperforms prior methods while requiring less computational overhead. Our contributions provide new insights into how to design efficient image transformation systems that leverage modern deep learning tools and techniques.",1
"Inductive program synthesis, or inferring programs from examples of desired behavior, offers a general paradigm for building interpretable, robust, and generalizable machine learning systems. Effective program synthesis depends on two key ingredients: a strong library of functions from which to build programs, and an efficient search strategy for finding programs that solve a given task. We introduce LAPS (Language for Abstraction and Program Search), a technique for using natural language annotations to guide joint learning of libraries and neurally-guided search models for synthesis. When integrated into a state-of-the-art library learning system (DreamCoder), LAPS produces higher-quality libraries and improves search efficiency and generalization on three domains -- string editing, image composition, and abstract reasoning about scenes -- even when no natural language hints are available at test time.",0
"This paper presents new methods that leverage language input/output pairs (e.g., API calls) from programmers as well as natural language descriptions of code snippets to learn models that predict good search heuristics for fixing bugs as well as generating code. Our approach uses these datasets together with recent advances in deep learning to train neural network models capable of encoding contexts into compact vector representations and decoding back human-readable strings capturing the key concepts involved. We evaluate our methodology using several bug fixes and code generation tasks and show that we can generate higher quality results compared to strong baseline approaches that do not exploit linguistic features. Our work has important implications for improving software development tools by enabling machines to better understand the intent behind programming actions and hence guide them towards more effective solutions. In future work, we plan on extending our approach to further applications such as developer collaboration support systems and interactive programming tutorials.",1
"Predicting gender by the name is not a simple task. In many applications, especially in the natural language processing (NLP) field, this task may be necessary, mainly when considering foreign names. Some machine learning algorithms can satisfactorily perform the prediction. In this paper, we examined and implemented feedforward and recurrent deep neural network models, such as MLP, RNN, GRU, CNN, and BiLSTM, to classify gender through the first name. A dataset of Brazilian names is used to train and evaluate the models. We analyzed the accuracy, recall, precision, and confusion matrix to measure the models' performances. The results indicate that the gender prediction can be performed from the feature extraction strategy looking at the names as a set of strings. Some models accurately predict the gender in more than 90% of the cases. The recurrent models overcome the feedforward models in this binary classification problem.",0

"This work introduces World-GAN, the first method to perform data-driven Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning in Minecraft from a single example. Based on a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, we are able to create arbitrarily sized world snippets from a given sample. We evaluate our approach on creations from the community as well as structures generated with the Minecraft World Generator. Our method is motivated by the dense representations used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduced with word2vec [1]. The proposed block2vec representations make World-GAN independent from the number of different blocks, which can vary a lot in Minecraft, and enable the generation of larger levels. Finally, we demonstrate that changing this new representation space allows us to change the generated style of an already trained generator. World-GAN enables its users to generate Minecraft worlds based on parts of their creations.",0
"Abstract:  The video game world of Minecraft has become extremely popular due to its blocky graphics, open-world exploration, and endless possibilities for players to create their own content within the game.

In this paper, we introduce World-GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), a generative model capable of creating realistic and diverse Minecraft worlds at scale. Our approach utilizes a deep neural network architecture inspired by GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) which have proven effective in other domains. We evaluate our generator on a dataset of existing Minecraft worlds and demonstrate its ability to generate highly detailed and varied worlds that closely match the statistical properties of these existing datasets. Additionally, we provide visualizations to showcase the fidelity and diversity of the generated worlds. Overall, this work represents a significant advancement towards automating the generation of high quality Minecraft worlds.",1
"Combining Natural Language with Vision represents a unique and interesting challenge in the domain of Artificial Intelligence.

"Purpose: Image classification is perhaps the most fundamental task in imaging AI. However, labeling images is time-consuming and tedious. We have recently demonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI brain images with high accuracy. Here we make two important steps toward speeding image classification: Firstly, we automatically extract class labels from the clinical reports. Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work to fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows: in Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural language processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to train a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes.   Methods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions. We then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2. In Part 2, we applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep-Q learning using 3D convolutions and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 90 images. We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes predicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1. For comparison, we also trained and tested a supervised deep learning classification network on the same set of training and testing images using the same labels.   Results: Part 1: Upon training with the corpus of radiology reports, the SBERT model had 100% accuracy for both normal and metastasis-containing scans. Part 2: Then, using these labels, whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data and as expected performed poorly on the testing set (66% accuracy, just over random guessing), the reinforcement learning approach achieved an accuracy of 92%. The results were found to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 3.1 x 10^-5.",0
"This research presents a novel method for analyzing 3D MRI brain scans using deep reinforcement learning and automated label extraction from clinical reports. The proposed approach achieved highly accurate classification of brain structures on a large dataset, demonstrating the potential for significantly improving medical image analysis. By leveraging both visual features and textual descriptions extracted from clinical reports, our model was able to effectively learn and identify complex anatomy patterns within brain images. Furthermore, we evaluated the generalization ability of our framework across different sites and scanning protocols, showing consistent performance even in new domains. Overall, these results represent a significant step towards fully automatic quantitative radiology, where human experts can focus their time on more challenging tasks while high quality quantification can be done efficiently by machine intelligence algorithms.",1
"This paper is a submission to the Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech (ADReSS) challenge, which aims to develop methods that can assist in the automated prediction of severity of Alzheimer's Disease from speech data. We focus on acoustic and natural language features for cognitive impairment detection in spontaneous speech in the context of Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score prediction. We proposed a model that obtains unimodal decisions from different LSTMs, one for each modality of text and audio, and then combines them using a gating mechanism for the final prediction. We focused on sequential modelling of text and audio and investigated whether the disfluencies present in individuals' speech relate to the extent of their cognitive impairment. Our results show that the proposed classification and regression schemes obtain very promising results on both development and test sets. This suggests Alzheimer's Disease can be detected successfully with sequence modeling of the speech data of medical sessions.",0
"This study presents a novel approach for recognizing early signs of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) by analyzing multi-modal features extracted from spontaneous speech samples. To achieve this goal, we propose a feature fusion mechanism based on gate units that integrates three types of informative cues: acoustic features obtained through audio recordings, textual features derived from transcripts, and prosodic features captured via disfluency analysis. By fusing these modalities in a carefully designed manner, our system can better capture important patterns and subtleties that may escape single-modality systems, thus boosting performance significantly. We evaluated our method on two publicly available datasets consisting of individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or AD, along with healthy controls, achieving promising results. Our findings suggest that our approach offers valuable insights into the development of automated systems capable of identifying early symptoms of AD from natural language data, which could assist in improving patient outcomes.",1
"World models improve a learning agent's ability to efficiently operate in interactive and situated environments. This work focuses on the task of building world models of text-based game environments. Text-based games, or interactive narratives, are reinforcement learning environments in which agents perceive and interact with the world using textual natural language. These environments contain long, multi-step puzzles or quests woven through a world that is filled with hundreds of characters, locations, and objects. Our world model learns to simultaneously: (1) predict changes in the world caused by an agent's actions when representing the world as a knowledge graph; and (2) generate the set of contextually relevant natural language actions required to operate in the world. We frame this task as a Set of Sequences generation problem by exploiting the inherent structure of knowledge graphs and actions and introduce both a transformer-based multi-task architecture and a loss function to train it. A zero-shot ablation study on never-before-seen textual worlds shows that our methodology significantly outperforms existing textual world modeling techniques as well as the importance of each of our contributions.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing world models that can represent knowledge graphs of complex environments. These models have many potential applications, including enabling robots to navigate unfamiliar spaces and improving natural language understanding by virtual agents. To build effective world models based on text descriptions, we need algorithms that can efficiently integrate large amounts of disparate data into coherent representations of real and imagined scenarios. This paper presents an approach called ""Learning Knowledge Graph-Based World Models from Text"" (KGWMT) which leverages advances in deep learning, graph representation, and computer vision to create accurate, detailed world models from written descriptions alone. Our method starts by processing input texts using transformers pretrained for question answering and summarization tasks. Next, we use graph convolutional networks to embed text entities as nodes and their relationships as edges within an attributed graph. Finally, our model integrates visual features obtained via object detection systems to improve generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KGWMT on several benchmark datasets across multiple domains, showing significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches. Overall, our work highlights the feasibility of automatically generating world models from plain text sources and offers new possibilities for building intelligent systems in areas such as robotics and human-computer interaction.",1
"Predicting chemical properties from the structure of a molecule is of great importance in many applications including drug discovery and material design. Machine learning based molecular property prediction holds the promise of enabling accurate predictions at much less complexity, when compared to, for example Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Features extracted from molecular graphs, using graph neural nets in a supervised manner, have emerged as strong baselines for such tasks. However, the vast chemical space together with the limited availability of labels makes supervised learning challenging, calling for learning a general-purpose molecular representation. Recently, pre-trained transformer-based language models (PTLMs) on large unlabeled corpus have produced state-of-the-art results in many downstream natural language processing tasks. Inspired by this development, here we present molecular embeddings obtained by training an efficient transformer encoder model, referred to as MoLFormer. This model was employed with a linear attention mechanism and highly paralleized training on 1D SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion unlabeled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC datasets. Experiments show that the learned molecular representation performs competitively, when compared to existing graph-based and fingerprint-based supervised learning baselines, on the challenging tasks of predicting properties of QM8 and QM9 molecules. Further task-specific fine-tuning of the MoLFormerr representation improves performance on several of those property prediction benchmarks. These results provide encouraging evidence that large-scale molecular language models can capture sufficient structural information to be able to accurately predict quantum chemical properties and beyond.",0
"In recent years, large scale molecular language representations have become increasingly popular in natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and machine translation. These methods rely on pretraining massive transformer models on very large corpora of text data, and then fine-tuning them for specific tasks using task-specific objectives. However, there has been limited investigation into whether these models capture important structural information beyond simple co-occurrence patterns that can improve performance on downstream tasks. This study seeks to address this gap by examining how well several state-of-the-art pretrained language models capture three types of linguistic structure: hierarchical dependencies among phrases and sentences, coreference chains linking mentions across texts, and semantic relatedness between concepts. Using standard evaluation metrics from prior work, we find that while these models perform reasonably well overall, they exhibit substantial variation in their ability to capture different types of structure depending on the model architecture and pretraining corpus used. Our results suggest new opportunities for developing more advanced preprocessing techniques based on richer linguistic knowledge and automated annotation tools to enhance the quality of input data for downstream applications. Finally, our study provides insights into potential future research directions aimed at designing more effective models that leverage both deep learning algorithms and formal linguistics theories to achieve better generalization and interpretability for NLP tasks.",1
"The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.",0
"In this research paper we explore the effectiveness of transformer models on graph data representation tasks. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements made in the field of natural language processing due to the introduction of transformer architectures. Then, we discuss their application on graph data representation and how their performance compares to traditional approaches like GNNs (Graph Neural Networks). Our experimental results show that while transformer based models have achieved state-of-the art performances on textual data they perform poorly when applied directly to graph data representation tasks. Furthermore, our study reveals insights into why these models struggle to learn meaningful representations from graphs. Finally, we provide suggestions for future research directions aimed at improving transformer model performances on graph data representation. Our findings highlight the need for more careful consideration of model architecture design choices and data preprocessing techniques when working with graph structured data.",1
"Pretrained language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance when adapted to a downstream NLP task. However, theoretical analysis of these models is scarce and challenging since the pretraining and downstream tasks can be very different. We propose an analysis framework that links the pretraining and downstream tasks with an underlying latent variable generative model of text -- the downstream classifier must recover a function of the posterior distribution over the latent variables. We analyze head tuning (learning a classifier on top of the frozen pretrained model) and prompt tuning in this setting. The generative model in our analysis is either a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or an HMM augmented with a latent memory component, motivated by long-term dependencies in natural language. We show that 1) under certain non-degeneracy conditions on the HMM, simple classification heads can solve the downstream task, 2) prompt tuning obtains downstream guarantees with weaker non-degeneracy conditions, and 3) our recovery guarantees for the memory-augmented HMM are stronger than for the vanilla HMM because task-relevant information is easier to recover from the long-term memory. Experiments on synthetically generated data from HMMs back our theoretical findings.",0

Additionally, we examine potential drawbacks and limitations, highlighting the need for further study and refinement of the LM pipeline. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into the efficacy of pretrained models for natural language processing and their role in future research directions.

"The inductive biases of graph representation learning algorithms are often encoded in the background geometry of their embedding space. In this paper, we show that general directed graphs can be effectively represented by an embedding model that combines three components: a pseudo-Riemannian metric structure, a non-trivial global topology, and a unique likelihood function that explicitly incorporates a preferred direction in embedding space. We demonstrate the representational capabilities of this method by applying it to the task of link prediction on a series of synthetic and real directed graphs from natural language applications and biology. In particular, we show that low-dimensional cylindrical Minkowski and anti-de Sitter spacetimes can produce equal or better graph representations than curved Riemannian manifolds of higher dimensions.",0
"In this paper we consider embeddings of directed graphs into pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, focusing on questions related to existence and uniqueness of such embeddings. We begin by introducing some preliminary definitions and results from the theory of pseudo-Riemannian geometry, as well as discussing motivating examples that arise in physics and engineering. We then turn to our main topic, studying properties of embeddings under different assumptions on the graph and manifold. This involves developing new techniques based on linear algebra and differential equations. Our analysis leads to new results regarding necessary conditions for embedding existence and unique determination of such embeddings up to diffeomorphism. Along the way, we highlight connections to other areas of mathematics and science, including control theory, optimization, and machine learning. Overall, our work contributes towards understanding the mathematical structure underlying systems that can be modeled using graphs embedded in spaces with nonpositive curvature.",1
"In this work, we address the task of referring image segmentation (RIS), which aims at predicting a segmentation mask for the object described by a natural language expression. Most existing methods focus on establishing unidirectional or directional relationships between visual and linguistic features to associate two modalities together, while the multi-scale context is ignored or insufficiently modeled. Multi-scale context is crucial to localize and segment those objects that have large scale variations during the multi-modal fusion process. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective Cascaded Multi-modal Fusion (CMF) module, which stacks multiple atrous convolutional layers in parallel and further introduces a cascaded branch to fuse visual and linguistic features. The cascaded branch can progressively integrate multi-scale contextual information and facilitate the alignment of two modalities during the multi-modal fusion process. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/jianhua2022/CMF-Refseg.",0
"In recent years, there have been advances made in deep learning techniques such as computer vision that has allowed us to make accurate predictions through image segmentation tasks. One particular challenge faced by these models is dealing with complex real world situations where ground truth annotations cannot always capture all possible variations seen in images due to occlusion, partial occlusions, blurred boundaries etc.. These issues can lead to increased difficulty in model training as well as reducing the accuracy of predictions.  To address some of the shortcomings present in current state of art approaches we propose a new method based on multi modal fusion called CMF:Cascade multi-modal fusion architecture for referring image segmentation. Our approach uses multiple individual semantic and instance mask heads within a single decoder which allows for better encoding of contextual relationships across multiple classes compared to previous methods using only one head per class. We use this architecture along with a novel cascading mechanism that sequentially refines the intermediate outputs from each masking task. This ensures high quality output for each step of the process allowing for more stable and coherent final results even if each single stage might perform poorly compared to traditional pipelines. Additionally our cascading design provides an extra regularization effect during optimization that stabilizes convergence, leading to better generalization performance overall.  The experiments conducted show that our proposed CMF approach yields significant improvement over existing methods on challenging datasets, demonstrating that our system is able to accurately model both object shape semantics and pixelwise instances for high resolution images while generalizing well across domains",1
"Variational autoencoders have been widely applied for natural language generation, however, there are two long-standing problems: information under-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact that only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent space, which is insufficient to summarize data. The latter comes as a result of the imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in the objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the discrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the attention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is combined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency from observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation. Moreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed approach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with the common Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on language generation demonstrate superior advantages of our proposed approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art counterparts.",0
"Abstract: Modern deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results on tasks such as language modeling and translation. However, these models often struggle with generating coherent and contextually relevant outputs due to their reliance on local patterns and lack of global understanding. Recently proposed attention mechanisms attempt to address this issue by allowing neural networks to selectively focus on different parts of input data. Inspired by these methods, we introduce Discrete Variational Attention (DVA), which extends variational autoencoders to incorporate discrete latent variables that control the allocation of attention. Our approach enables flexible encoding and decoding of textual representations while preserving spatial dependencies within them. We evaluate our method using various benchmark datasets and demonstrate competitive performance compared to several baseline models. Additionally, we provide insightful visualizations that showcase how DVAs learn meaningful attention maps during training, emphasizing its effectiveness for natural language generation tasks. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing more efficient and expressive generative models capable of capturing complex relationships in high-dimensional spaces.",1
"We introduce a self-supervised vision representation model BEiT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers. Following BERT developed in the natural language processing area, we propose a masked image modeling task to pretrain vision Transformers. Specifically, each image has two views in our pre-training, i.e, image patches (such as 16x16 pixels), and visual tokens (i.e., discrete tokens). We first ""tokenize"" the original image into visual tokens. Then we randomly mask some image patches and fed them into the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the original visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training BEiT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by appending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves competitive results with previous pre-training methods. For example, base-size BEiT achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, significantly outperforming from-scratch DeiT training (81.8%) with the same setup. Moreover, large-size BEiT obtains 86.3% only using ImageNet-1K, even outperforming ViT-L with supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K (85.2%). The code and pretrained models are available at https://aka.ms/beit.",0
"We present BEiT, which pre-trains vision transformers on image-text data by predicting masked tokens given corresponding human descriptions. This results in improved text understanding performance on several NLP benchmarks without any changes to model architecture or parameters. We establish that our pre-training improves zero-shot transfer compared to previous methods, including CLIP, achieving SOTA in most cases. BEiT reduces gaps across many datasets, but some discrepancies remain unexplained, offering promising directions for future work.",1
"Transformer models have demonstrated superior performance in natural language processing. The dot product self-attention in Transformer allows us to model interactions between words. However, this modeling comes with significant computational overhead. In this work, we revisit the memory-compute trade-off associated with Transformer, particularly multi-head attention, and show a memory-heavy but significantly more compute-efficient alternative to Transformer. Our proposal, denoted as PairConnect, a multilayer perceptron (MLP), models the pairwise interaction between words by explicit pairwise word embeddings. As a result, PairConnect substitutes self dot product with a simple embedding lookup. We show mathematically that despite being an MLP, our compute-efficient PairConnect is strictly more expressive than Transformer. Our experiment on language modeling tasks suggests that PairConnect could achieve comparable results with Transformer while reducing the computational cost associated with inference significantly.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized several fields by providing state-of-the-art results across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and many others. These advances have been facilitated by advancements in hardware technology, which enable training on massive amounts of data using complex models that contain millions of parameters. However, even with these advancements, computational limitations remain a significant challenge faced during both training and inference, especially for larger models and datasets. One approach proposed to tackle this issue is attention mechanisms, which selectively focus on certain parts of a sequence rather than considering all elements equally. While effective, attention adds additional complexity to the model, resulting in increased computation requirements compared to traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs). This work presents PairConnect, an alternative approach based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that can achieve competitive performance while requiring fewer computations relative to conventional FNNs equipped with attentional components. We demonstrate this through extensive experiments on image classification, text generation, and machine translation tasks. Our findings show that our method achieves comparable accuracy and speed compared to popular transformer architectures. As such, PairConnect provides a promising direction for designing efficient NLP systems in low-resource settings where limited compute budgets must support high demand loads.",1
"Transformers have achieved great success in many artificial intelligence fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. Therefore, it is natural to attract lots of interest from academic and industry researchers. Up to the present, a great variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers) have been proposed, however, a systematic and comprehensive literature review on these Transformer variants is still missing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various X-formers. We first briefly introduce the vanilla Transformer and then propose a new taxonomy of X-formers. Next, we introduce the various X-formers from three perspectives: architectural modification, pre-training, and applications. Finally, we outline some potential directions for future research.",0
"This could refer directly to any number of different things (the author, the topic) etc. A better option would be ""an"" as that implies there may well be others. In addition, you might consider changing ""survey"" to something like ""overview"" as that gives more flavour without using up quite so many characters:--- An Overview of Transformer Architectures Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing have been enabled by large pre-trained models such as BERT [8] and GPT-4 [7]. These models are based on self attention mechanisms [9], which allows them to effectively weigh input features and perform reasoning across global dependencies. However, these architectures can suffer from quadratic memory complexity with respect to input length. Various techniques for reducing the computational cost have been proposed [2]. Notably, multiheaded dot product attention [6] and relative positional encoding methods were introduced [3] to reduce the quadratic blowup while maintaining the quality of model predictions. Other approaches [5] attempt to approximate these models at inference time to enable faster computation but sacrifice some accuracy. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of these trends and highlight recent works towards efficient and accurate deep learning models for NLP tasks. Keywords: transformer architecture, efficient deep learning, natural language processing",1
"The spectacular success of deep generative models calls for quantitative tools to measure their statistical performance. Divergence frontiers have recently been proposed as an evaluation framework for generative models, due to their ability to measure the quality-diversity trade-off inherent to deep generative modeling. However, the statistical behavior of divergence frontiers estimated from data remains unknown to this day. In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity of the plug-in estimator of divergence frontiers. Along the way, we introduce a novel integral summary of divergence frontiers. We derive the corresponding non-asymptotic bounds and discuss the choice of the quantization level by balancing the two types of approximation errors arisen from its computation. We also augment the divergence frontier framework by investigating the statistical performance of smoothed distribution estimators such as the Good-Turing estimator. We illustrate the theoretical results with numerical examples from natural language processing and computer vision.",0
"Abstract:  This paper explores the concept of divergence frontiers as applied to generative models. Divergence frontiers refer to points in model space where there is little difference between two distributions. By understanding these frontiers, we can gain insight into how different aspects of model performance relate to each other and identify areas for improvement. We study sample complexity, quantization level, and frontier integral as key parameters that affect divergence frontiers and discuss their impact on generator outputs. Our findings suggest that optimizing models based solely on metrics like perplexity may result in suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to noise. This research underscores the importance of considering trade-offs in model design choices and provides guidance on selecting appropriate evaluation measures. Overall, our work contributes to developing more robust and effective generative models by highlighting the complex interplay among model characteristics.",1
"Despite impressive performance on many text classification tasks, deep neural networks tend to learn frequent superficial patterns that are specific to the training data and do not always generalize well. In this work, we observe this limitation with respect to the task of native language identification. We find that standard text classifiers which perform well on the test set end up learning topical features which are confounds of the prediction task (e.g., if the input text mentions Sweden, the classifier predicts that the author's native language is Swedish). We propose a method that represents the latent topical confounds and a model which ""unlearns"" confounding features by predicting both the label of the input text and the confound; but we train the two predictors adversarially in an alternating fashion to learn a text representation that predicts the correct label but is less prone to using information about the confound. We show that this model generalizes better and learns features that are indicative of the writing style rather than the content.",0
"""Latent confounding is a common issue in natural language processing that occurs when hidden factors influence the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variables in a model, leading to reduced accuracy and interpretability. In text classification tasks, latent confounding can arise from various sources such as topic ambiguity, context sensitivity, and measurement errors. Ignoring these confounders may result in poor performance, biased estimates, and misleading conclusions. This paper presents an overview of the most common topics that cause latent confounding issues in text classification, providing insights into their impact on model performance and suggestions for mitigating them. By demoting these confounds, researchers can improve the reliability and validity of their findings, enabling more accurate predictions and better decision-making.""",1
"Despite significant improvements in natural language understanding models with the advent of models like BERT and XLNet, these neural-network based classifiers are vulnerable to blackbox adversarial attacks, where the attacker is only allowed to query the target model outputs. We add two more realistic restrictions on the attack methods, namely limiting the number of queries allowed (query budget) and crafting attacks that easily transfer across different pre-trained models (transferability), which render previous attack models impractical and ineffective. Here, we propose a target model agnostic adversarial attack method with a high degree of attack transferability across the attacked models. Our empirical studies show that in comparison to baseline methods, our method generates highly transferable adversarial sentences under the restriction of limited query budgets.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to adversarial attacks against language understanding models that is agnostic to the target model and can work within query budgets. Existing methods have limitations in terms of their dependence on specific models or the lack of ability to function under resource constraints. Our method addresses these issues by using a simple yet effective strategy based on random search and gradient estimation. We evaluate our approach on several popular benchmarks and show significant improvements over baseline methods across different datasets, architectures, and settings. Our results highlight the effectiveness of our method as well as its robustness to changes in the environment. Overall, we believe that this research has important implications for advancing the field of natural language processing and improving the security of language understanding systems.",1
"Recently, chest X-ray report generation, which aims to automatically generate descriptions of given chest X-ray images, has received growing research interests. The key challenge of chest X-ray report generation is to accurately capture and describe the abnormal regions. In most cases, the normal regions dominate the entire chest X-ray image, and the corresponding descriptions of these normal regions dominate the final report. Due to such data bias, learning-based models may fail to attend to abnormal regions. In this work, to effectively capture and describe abnormal regions, we propose the Contrastive Attention (CA) model. Instead of solely focusing on the current input image, the CA model compares the current input image with normal images to distill the contrastive information. The acquired contrastive information can better represent the visual features of abnormal regions. According to the experiments on the public IU-X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, incorporating our CA into several existing models can boost their performance across most metrics. In addition, according to the analysis, the CA model can help existing models better attend to the abnormal regions and provide more accurate descriptions which are crucial for an interpretable diagnosis. Specifically, we achieve the state-of-the-art results on the two public datasets.",0
"This work presents a novel approach for automatic chest x-ray report generation using contrastive attention mechanisms. We propose a deep learning framework that leverages both image features and textual radiologist reports as inputs to generate accurate and informative chest x-ray reports. Our model employs a dual-stream architecture consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN), which capture spatial and temporal patterns respectively. To better attend to relevant regions in the images, we introduce a region-specific contrastive module that learns joint representations of the input images and their corresponding radiology reports. Experiments on two large datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of quantitative metrics such as ROUGE scores and F1 measures, as well as qualitatively through visual inspections by domain experts. Our results suggest that incorporating attention mechanism can significantly improve the accuracy and coherence of generated chest x-ray reports compared to existing methods without attention modules. Overall, our study highlights the potential of deep learning techniques for automating medical reporting tasks, offering promising directions for future research.",1
Knowledge Graph (KG) completion research usually focuses on densely connected benchmark datasets that are not representative of real KGs. We curate two KG datasets that include biomedical and encyclopedic knowledge and use an existing commonsense KG dataset to explore KG completion in the more realistic setting where dense connectivity is not guaranteed. We develop a deep convolutional network that utilizes textual entity representations and demonstrate that our model outperforms recent KG completion methods in this challenging setting. We find that our model's performance improvements stem primarily from its robustness to sparsity. We then distill the knowledge from the convolutional network into a student network that re-ranks promising candidate entities. This re-ranking stage leads to further improvements in performance and demonstrates the effectiveness of entity re-ranking for KG completion.,0
"In recent years, knowledge graph completion has become increasingly important in Artificial Intelligence research due to the abundance of structured data available online. This task involves predicting missing links (or edges) between entities within a large knowledge graph. Previous approaches have utilized embedding techniques and neural networks to achieve good results on benchmark datasets such as DBpedia. However, there remains room for improvement in terms of robustness and generalization performance across different tasks.  In this work, we propose a novel approach called Stacked Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN), which combines the strengths of convolutional operations and recurrent architectures. Our model consists of multiple convolutional layers that learn to extract hierarchical representations from the input graphs. We also introduce a student re-ranking network to increase the robustness of our predictions by leveraging the uncertainty estimated by the SCNN.  We evaluate the effectiveness of our method against state-of-the-art baselines using three popular benchmark datasets: FB15K-237, WN18, and YAGO43. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods across all metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, ablation studies show that each component of our proposed architecture contributes significantly towards improving overall performance.  Overall, our framework provides a powerful tool for completing knowledge graphs while achieving better robustness and generalization capabilities. Its scalability makes it suitable for real-world applications where high-quality knowledge representations are crucial. Future directions involve extending these concepts to more complex and dynamic settings, such as learning continually from new data streams or incorporating advanced reasoning mechanisms into the pipeline.",1
"Sparsely-gated Mixture of Experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated excellent scalability in Natural Language Processing. In Computer Vision, however, almost all performant networks are ""dense"", that is, every input is processed by every parameter. We present a Vision MoE (V-MoE), a sparse version of the Vision Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with the largest dense networks. When applied to image recognition, V-MoE matches the performance of state-of-the-art networks, while requiring as little as half of the compute at inference time. Further, we propose an extension to the routing algorithm that can prioritize subsets of each input across the entire batch, leading to adaptive per-image compute. This allows V-MoE to trade-off performance and compute smoothly at test-time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of V-MoE to scale vision models, and train a 15B parameter model that attains 90.35% on ImageNet.",0
"In this work we present the first attempt at scaling up the state-of-the-art dense vision model architecture Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) without sacrificing accuracy; our method uses only a fraction of the parameters compared to other proposed methods while still achieving comparable results on popular benchmark datasets such as COCO Stuff (Caesar et al., 2018). Our approach builds upon previous research by adopting their use of attention mechanisms to distill knowledge from higher capacity models into smaller ones but generalizes it to dense architectures where self-attention becomes computationally prohibitive, requiring us instead to resort to sparse mixtures of experts. We introduce two novelties: adding spatial consistency requirements to these mixtures that prevent degenerate solutions, which allows using much less computation during training without loss of quality, and a simple yet effective reparameterization of the mixing weights’ posterior distribution making optimization much easier than vanilla importance sampling techniques used thus far. Overall, the presented system represents a promising step forward towards efficient realtime object detection systems deployable in today’s mainstream hardware configurations.",1
"Transformer has been widely used for self-supervised pre-training in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and achieved great success. However, it has not been fully explored in visual self-supervised learning. Meanwhile, previous methods only consider the high-level feature and learning representation from a global perspective, which may fail to transfer to the downstream dense prediction tasks focusing on local features. In this paper, we present a novel Masked Self-supervised Transformer approach named MST, which can explicitly capture the local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information. Specifically, inspired by the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in NLP, we propose a masked token strategy based on the multi-head self-attention map, which dynamically masks some tokens of local patches without damaging the crucial structure for self-supervised learning. More importantly, the masked tokens together with the remaining tokens are further recovered by a global image decoder, which preserves the spatial information of the image and is more friendly to the downstream dense prediction tasks. The experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. For instance, MST achieves Top-1 accuracy of 76.9% with DeiT-S only using 300-epoch pre-training by linear evaluation, which outperforms supervised methods with the same epoch by 0.4% and its comparable variant DINO by 1.0\%. For dense prediction tasks, MST also achieves 42.7% mAP on MS COCO object detection and 74.04% mIoU on Cityscapes segmentation only with 100-epoch pre-training.",0
"Title: Unlocking the Potential of Self-Supervision for Vision: Masked Self-Supervised Transformer (MST)  Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful alternative to supervised learning in the field of computer vision. By leveraging large amounts of unlabelled data and cleverly designed pretext tasks, self-supervised models have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. Despite their impressive performance, these methods often struggle to fully exploit the potential of self-supervision due to limitations in their design. In particular, existing techniques tend to rely heavily on heuristics and handcrafted features, which can limit their effectiveness and generalizability.  In this work, we present Masked Self-Supervised Transformer (MST), a new approach that addresses these issues by combining masked self-attention with advanced visual representations based on transformers. Our method learns meaningful representations through two complementary objectives: predicting missing tokens in masked images and predicting image-level labels from transformed feature vectors. These tasks allow us to directly optimize the quality of learned representations without relying on arbitrary architectural constraints or heuristics.  We evaluate our approach on several challenging benchmarks including ImageNet, COCO, and Cityscapes, demonstrating significant improvements over previous self-supervised methods across all metrics. Our results show that MST effectively captures high-quality visual representations through self-supervision alone, even outperforming strongly supervised models trained on smaller datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model exhibits strong transfer capabilities, achieving competitive results on multiple downstream tasks with limited fine-tuning. Overall, our study highlights the potential of MST as a flexible and effective framework for unleashing the power of self-supervision in computer vision.",1
"The global spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has cast a significant threat to mankind. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, predicting localized disease severity is crucial for advanced resource allocation. This paper proposes a method named COURAGE (COUnty aggRegation mixup AuGmEntation) to generate a short-term prediction of 2-week-ahead COVID-19 related deaths for each county in the United States, leveraging modern deep learning techniques. Specifically, our method adopts a self-attention model from Natural Language Processing, known as the transformer model, to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies within the time series while enjoying computational efficiency. Our model fully utilizes publicly available information of COVID-19 related confirmed cases, deaths, community mobility trends and demographic information, and can produce state-level prediction as an aggregation of the corresponding county-level predictions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the publicly available benchmark models.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to predicting COVID-19 cases using county aggregation mixed up augmentation (COURAGE). We propose that by combining data from multiple counties and applying randomized transformations to the data, we can improve predictions of future case numbers. Our model uses machine learning algorithms trained on these combined datasets to make probabilistic predictions at each time step. We evaluate our method against existing baseline models and show that COURAGE significantly outperforms them in terms of accuracy and stability across different areas and time periods. Additionally, we demonstrate how the uncertainty estimates provided by our method can inform decision making related to public health interventions such as contact tracing and vaccination efforts. Overall, COURAGE represents a promising new tool for the prediction and management of COVID-19 cases in real-time.",1
"After their successful debut in natural language processing, Transformer architectures are now becoming the de-facto standard in many domains. An obstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural configuration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically vary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We theoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits the contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We thus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal depth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added advantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this bottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer architectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often glossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in different domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework allows us to identify size redundancies of $25\%-50\%$ in leading NLP models such as ALBERT and T5.",0
"This paper investigates how different Transformer architectures can affect the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on specific types of datasets. We identify that one of the key factors influencing model accuracy is the amount of unique tokens each dataset contains. By using a novel tokenization method and evaluating several popular Transformer architectures across four benchmark NLP tasks, we show that larger models are more effective at handling large datasets with diverse and complex terminology. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both the size and complexity of the dataset when selecting a suitable Transformer architecture for NLP tasks. Ultimately, our research contributes towards improving model selection for better overall NLP performance.",1
"Neural language models can be successfully trained on source code, leading to applications such as code completion. However, their versatile autoregressive self-supervision objective overlooks important global sequence-level features that are present in the data such as syntactic correctness or compilability. In this work, we pose the problem of learning to generate compilable code as constraint satisfaction. We define an Energy-Based Model (EBM) representing a pre-trained generative model with an imposed constraint of generating only compilable sequences. We then use the KL-Adaptive Distributional Policy Gradient algorithm (Khalifa et al., 2021) to train a generative model approximating the EBM. We conduct experiments showing that our proposed approach is able to improve compilability rates without sacrificing diversity and complexity of the generated samples.",0

"The recent advanced deep learning techniques have shown the promising results in various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. The success of deep neural networks in supervised learning heavily relies on a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data with target labels is often challenging due to various reasons such as cost of labeling and privacy issues, which challenges existing deep models. In spite of that, it is relatively easy to obtain data with \textit{inexact supervision}, i.e., having labels/tags related to the target task. For example, social media platforms are overwhelmed with billions of posts and images with self-customized tags, which are not the exact labels for target classification tasks but are usually related to the target labels. It is promising to leverage these tags (inexact supervision) and their relations with target classes to generate labeled data to facilitate the downstream classification tasks. However, the work on this is rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of labeled data generation with inexact supervision. We propose a novel generative framework named as ADDES which can synthesize high-quality labeled data for target classification tasks by learning from data with inexact supervision and the relations between inexact supervision and target classes. Experimental results on image and text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADDES for generating realistic labeled data from inexact supervision to facilitate the target classification task.",0
"This research presents a methodology for generating labeled training data using inexactly specified supervisory guidance. The generation process involves two main components: an image generator that produces candidate images based on a textual prompt, and a discriminator that evaluates the generated images for quality and relevance. The inexact supervision comes from human annotators who provide high-level labels or descriptions of the desired output rather than explicit annotations for every pixel or object within the image. To handle these imprecise guidelines, we develop algorithms for inferring a soft label distribution over possible interpretations and refining the image generation parameters accordingly. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets for image generation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework for leveraging limited or ambiguous supervision signals. By enabling more flexible forms of annotation input, we hope to broaden the scope of machine learning applications that can benefit from large-scale data synthesis processes like those proposed here.",1
"Transformers are widely used in natural language processing due to their ability to model longer-term dependencies in text. Although these models achieve state-of-the-art performance for many language related tasks, their applicability outside of the natural language processing field has been minimal. In this work, we propose the use of transformer models for the prediction of dynamical systems representative of physical phenomena. The use of Koopman based embeddings provide a unique and powerful method for projecting any dynamical system into a vector representation which can then be predicted by a transformer model. The proposed model is able to accurately predict various dynamical systems and outperform classical methods that are commonly used in the scientific machine learning literature.",0
"Here’s a new one I made up: “The application of transformer models has significantly improved natural language processing tasks over traditional approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, their use in modeling physical systems still remains limited due to several challenges related to nonlinearity, time dependence, and multimodality. In this work, we aim to address these limitations by developing novel architectures that incorporate physics-informed constraints into the transformer framework using mechanisms such as attention masking and adaptive filtering. Our contributions provide insights on how to effectively leverage transformers in complex domains involving physical systems while maintaining efficiency and interpretability. We evaluate our approach on a variety of problems across different disciplines including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and structural analysis demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.”",1
"We study the task of conversational fashion image retrieval via multiturn natural language feedback. Most previous studies are based on single-turn settings. Existing models on multiturn conversational fashion image retrieval have limitations, such as employing traditional models, and leading to ineffective performance. We propose a novel framework that can effectively handle conversational fashion image retrieval with multiturn natural language feedback texts. One characteristic of the framework is that it searches for candidate images based on exploitation of the encoded reference image and feedback text information together with the conversation history. Furthermore, the image fashion attribute information is leveraged via a mutual attention strategy. Since there is no existing fashion dataset suitable for the multiturn setting of our task, we derive a large-scale multiturn fashion dataset via additional manual annotation efforts on an existing single-turn dataset. The experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to fashion image retrieval using conversational feedback from users. Our method utilizes natural language queries and multiturn interactions to improve accuracy and relevance in retrieved images. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely solely on visual features, our system leverages textual descriptions provided by users to capture their preferences and narrow down search results. Experimental evaluations show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and user satisfaction. We conclude that conversational fashion image retrieval holds great potential for enhancing online shopping experiences and facilitating more personalized recommendations.",1
"Although deep learning models have driven state-of-the-art performance on a wide array of tasks, they are prone to learning spurious correlations that should not be learned as predictive clues. To mitigate this problem, we propose a causality-based training framework to reduce the spurious correlations caused by observable confounders. We give theoretical analysis on the underlying general Structural Causal Model (SCM) and propose to perform Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on the interventional distribution instead of the observational distribution, namely Counterfactual Maximum Likelihood Estimation (CMLE). As the interventional distribution, in general, is hidden from the observational data, we then derive two different upper bounds of the expected negative log-likelihood and propose two general algorithms, Implicit CMLE and Explicit CMLE, for causal predictions of deep learning models using observational data. We conduct experiments on two real-world tasks: Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Image Captioning. The results show that CMLE methods outperform the regular MLE method in terms of out-of-domain generalization performance and reducing spurious correlations, while maintaining comparable performance on the regular evaluations.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has emerged as one of the most effective approaches to artificial intelligence, allowing machines to learn and make predictions based on large amounts of data. One challenge in training deep networks lies in optimizing their parameters to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual outcomes. This task can be difficult due to the complex nature of these models and the limited availability of ground truth data.  To address this issue, we propose a novel method called counterfactual maximum likelihood estimation (CME) that leverages counterfactual examples to improve the accuracy of deep network training. CME works by generating hypothetical inputs that would lead the model to produce different outputs than the actual ones, thus enabling us to evaluate how well the model generalizes to situations outside its training set. By maximizing the likelihood of these counterfactuals, our approach helps guide the optimization process towards better predictive performance.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of CME through extensive experiments using several benchmark datasets across different domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. Our results show that incorporating counterfactuals into the training process leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we observe that the proposed method requires fewer labels than traditional supervised techniques while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. These findings highlight the promise of CME in advancing the development of robust deep neural networks. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on efficient yet accurate deep learning training methods.",1
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have promoted a variety of applications in computer vision, natural language processing, etc. due to its generative model's compelling ability to generate realistic examples plausibly drawn from an existing distribution of samples. GAN not only provides impressive performance on data generation-based tasks but also stimulates fertilization for privacy and security oriented research because of its game theoretic optimization strategy. Unfortunately, there are no comprehensive surveys on GAN in privacy and security, which motivates this survey paper to summarize those state-of-the-art works systematically. The existing works are classified into proper categories based on privacy and security functions, and this survey paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of their advantages and drawbacks.

We highlight key insights from recent work across several areas including privacy preserving data generation, robustness against adversaries and defenses, interpretability for security assurance, federated learning for distributed training, and real world deployments in critical infrastructure systems. Key benefits of GANs towards these applications are their ability to generate diverse high quality outputs, their capacity for generating novel problem specific solutions, and robustness even under uncertainty conditions during deployment. Challenges still remain which hinder wider adoption such as overfitting, sensitivity to hyperparameters, lack of interpretability of decision making process and issues related to generalization performance.

PCT is based on Transformer, which achieves huge success in natural language processing and displays great potential in image processing. It is inherently permutation invariant for processing a sequence of points, making it well-suited for point cloud learning. To better capture local context within the point cloud, we enhance input embedding with the support of farthest point sampling and nearest neighbor search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PCT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on shape classification, part segmentation and normal estimation tasks.",0
"In recent years, point clouds have become increasingly popular due to their ability to capture three-dimensional information accurately and efficiently.

Moreover, our ablation studies reveal that each component of the PCT architecture contributes significantly to improving performance.  In summary, this work presents a powerful new tool for point cloud analysis, paving the way for further advancements in computer vision and related fields.

"Transformer-based deep learning models have increasingly demonstrated high accuracy on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we propose a compression-compilation co-design framework that can guarantee the identified model to meet both resource and real-time specifications of mobile devices. Our framework applies a compiler-aware neural architecture optimization method (CANAO), which can generate the optimal compressed model that balances both accuracy and latency. We are able to achieve up to 7.8x speedup compared with TensorFlow-Lite with only minor accuracy loss. We present two types of BERT applications on mobile devices: Question Answering (QA) and Text Generation. Both can be executed in real-time with latency as low as 45ms.

"This abstract presents a framework that can compress large pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT while maintaining their accuracy on mobile devices without sacrificing speed. The proposed approach involves training a secondary model using smaller subsets of the data from the original PLM, resulting in reduced computational requirements while still preserving high levels of performance. Furthermore, our method also utilizes techniques like knowledge distillation and quantization to further reduce memory footprint and improve inference times. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve comparable results to full-size BERT models on several benchmark datasets while only requiring half the amount of time and taking up just one-twentieth of the space. These significant improvements make real-time natural language processing applications feasible on modern smartphones and other resource-constrained environments. Overall, our work represents an important step towards enabling powerful NLP capabilities on mobile platforms without compromising user experience due to slow or overly complex models.",1
"Can we teach a robot to recognize and make predictions for activities that it has never seen before? We tackle this problem by learning models for video from text. This paper presents a hierarchical model that generalizes instructional knowledge from large-scale text-corpora and transfers the knowledge to video. Given a portion of an instructional video, our model recognizes and predicts coherent and plausible actions multiple steps into the future, all in rich natural language. To demonstrate the capabilities of our model, we introduce the \emph{Tasty Videos Dataset V2}, a collection of 4022 recipes for zero-shot learning, recognition and anticipation. Extensive experiments with various evaluation metrics demonstrate the potential of our method for generalization, given limited video data for training models.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant advances in image recognition and understanding tasks. However, there still exist limitations in modeling complex dynamic scenes using these methods due to their reliance on large amounts of labeled training data. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes textual descriptions to train video models capable of predicting future frames with high accuracy, even in situations where little or no visual data is available (i.e., zero-shot anticipation). The proposed method relies on procedural action representations derived from natural language processing techniques which enable the representation of multi-step actions as sequences of steps or atoms. These representations capture spatial relationships and affordances present in both images and videos, enabling effective transfer across domains. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several benchmark datasets including AnticipationDB and PFVSD, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under zero-shot settings. The results showcase the potential of zero-shot anticipation in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and video generation.",1
"There is a growing interest in the community in making an embodied AI agent perform a complicated task while interacting with an environment following natural language directives. Recent studies have tackled the problem using ALFRED, a well-designed dataset for the task, but achieved only very low accuracy. This paper proposes a new method, which outperforms the previous methods by a large margin. It is based on a combination of several new ideas. One is a two-stage interpretation of the provided instructions. The method first selects and interprets an instruction without using visual information, yielding a tentative action sequence prediction. It then integrates the prediction with the visual information etc., yielding the final prediction of an action and an object. As the object's class to interact is identified in the first stage, it can accurately select the correct object from the input image. Moreover, our method considers multiple egocentric views of the environment and extracts essential information by applying hierarchical attention conditioned on the current instruction. This contributes to the accurate prediction of actions for navigation. A preliminary version of the method won the ALFRED Challenge 2020. The current version achieves the unseen environment's success rate of 4.45% with a single view, which is further improved to 8.37% with multiple views.",0
"This abstract outlines findings from experiments conducted in natural language processing (NLP) aimed at improving performance on interactive instruction-following tasks using deep learning techniques and algorithms that integrate external data sources such as web search results. By utilizing these methods, significant improvements were observed in overall task accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional NLP approaches. These promising results demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating additional contextual information into text understanding models for enhanced performance in interactive settings.",1
"Machine learning is vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks. It is now well understood that by changing the underlying data distribution, an adversary can poison the model trained with it or introduce backdoors. In this paper we present a novel class of training-time attacks that require no changes to the underlying dataset or model architecture, but instead only change the order in which data are supplied to the model. In particular, we find that the attacker can either prevent the model from learning, or poison it to learn behaviours specified by the attacker. Furthermore, we find that even a single adversarially-ordered epoch can be enough to slow down model learning, or even to reset all of the learning progress. Indeed, the attacks presented here are not specific to the model or dataset, but rather target the stochastic nature of modern learning procedures. We extensively evaluate our attacks on computer vision and natural language benchmarks to find that the adversary can disrupt model training and even introduce backdoors.",0
"This paper presents a novel attack on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, by manipulating the order of training data that is fed into the system. We show how carefully crafted input sequences can lead to significant deviation from the model's original behavior, resulting in incorrect predictions and degradation of performance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks across multiple models and datasets, highlighting the importance of considering data ordering as a potential vulnerability in SGD systems. In addition, we discuss several possible defense mechanisms against such attacks and evaluate their efficacy. Overall, our work sheds light on the security risks associated with data ordering in SGD algorithms and emphasizes the need for further research in this area.",1
"Text-based video segmentation is a challenging task that segments out the natural language referred objects in videos. It essentially requires semantic comprehension and fine-grained video understanding. Existing methods introduce language representation into segmentation models in a bottom-up manner, which merely conducts vision-language interaction within local receptive fields of ConvNets. We argue that such interaction is not fulfilled since the model can barely construct region-level relationships given partial observations, which is contrary to the description logic of natural language/referring expressions. In fact, people usually describe a target object using relations with other objects, which may not be easily understood without seeing the whole video. To address the issue, we introduce a novel top-down approach by imitating how we human segment an object with the language guidance. We first figure out all candidate objects in videos and then choose the refereed one by parsing relations among those high-level objects. Three kinds of object-level relations are investigated for precise relationship understanding, i.e., positional relation, text-guided semantic relation, and temporal relation. Extensive experiments on A2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Qualitative results also show our results are more explainable. Besides, based on the inspiration, we win the first place in CVPR2021 Referring Youtube-VOS challenge.",0
"An important task in computer vision is video segmentation, which involves separating objects from their backgrounds. Traditionally, this has been done using pixel-wise annotations and handcrafted features. However, these methods often struggle with handling large object occlusions and variations in appearance. In this work, we propose a novel approach called ""ClawCraneNet"" that leverages object-level relation reasoning for text-based video segmentation. Our method uses semantic bounding boxes as input and learns visual representations through attention mechanisms that capture spatial dependencies among pixels conditioned on instance labels. We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Overall, our results highlight the potential of integrating high-level semantics into video segmentation tasks, opening up new opportunities for computer vision research.",1
"Vision transformer (ViT) has recently showed its strong capability in achieving comparable results to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image classification. However, vanilla ViT simply inherits the same architecture from the natural language processing directly, which is often not optimized for vision applications. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a new architecture that adopts the pyramid structure and employ a novel regional-to-local attention rather than global self-attention in vision transformers. More specifically, our model first generates regional tokens and local tokens from an image with different patch sizes, where each regional token is associated with a set of local tokens based on the spatial location. The regional-to-local attention includes two steps: first, the regional self-attention extract global information among all regional tokens and then the local self-attention exchanges the information among one regional token and the associated local tokens via self-attention. Therefore, even though local self-attention confines the scope in a local region but it can still receive global information. Extensive experiments on three vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and action recognition, show that our approach outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art ViT variants including many concurrent works. Our source codes and models will be publicly available.",0
"This paper introduces the region-based vision transformer (RegionViT), which can efficiently localize important regions on images and videos while still maintaining strong global reasoning ability. We achieve this by replacing the self attention mechanism in vision transformers with regional attention that takes into account both intra-regional relationships within local windows as well as inter-relationships across all regions in the input space. By doing so we are able to model objects at different scales, from coarse object boundaries down to fine details like hair and fur. Our method also extends naturally to video where it models spatio-temporal representations capturing motions such as human walking patterns. RegionViT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art alternatives including recent efficient models designed specifically for image classification tasks on the ImageNet benchmark. These results showcase the broad applicability of our approach beyond just imaging analysis to other computer vision problems, providing compelling evidence supporting adoption of RegionViTs for many real world applications of deep learning.",1
"The self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm is an essential exploration area, which tries to eliminate the need for expensive data labeling. Despite the great success of SSL methods in computer vision and natural language processing, most of them employ contrastive learning objectives that require negative samples, which are hard to define. This becomes even more challenging in the case of graphs and is a bottleneck for achieving robust representations. To overcome such limitations, we propose a framework for self-supervised graph representation learning -- Graph Barlow Twins, which utilizes a cross-correlation-based loss function instead of negative samples. Moreover, it does not rely on non-symmetric neural network architectures -- in contrast to state-of-the-art self-supervised graph representation learning method BGRL. We show that our method achieves as competitive results as BGRL, best self-supervised methods, and fully supervised ones while requiring substantially fewer hyperparameters and converging in an order of magnitude training steps earlier.",0
"Graphs have become increasingly important representations of complex data, with applications ranging from social networks to scientific simulations. However, many machine learning algorithms require large amounts of labeled training data to achieve good performance on graph tasks, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods for learning representations of graphs that do not require massive amounts of labeled data. One promising approach is self-supervised learning, where models learn by predicting missing or corrupted information within their own inputs rather than relying on external labels. This work presents a new self-supervised representation learning method called Graph Barlow Twins (GBT). GBT modifies traditional GCNs so they consistently make use of multiple views generated from different random augmentations of each node during training. Our results show that using just one view yields only a minor improvement over no pretraining at all on several benchmark datasets, while our multi-view variant significantly improves both the quality of learned embeddings, as well as outperforms existing unsupervised baselines across a range of downstream graph inference task evaluation metrics.",1
"Real-world machine learning systems are achieving remarkable performance in terms of coarse-grained metrics like overall accuracy and F-1 score. However, model improvement and development often require fine-grained modeling on individual data subsets or slices, for instance, the data slices where the models have unsatisfactory results. In practice, it gives tangible values for developing such models that can pay extra attention to critical or interested slices while retaining the original overall performance. This work extends the recent slice-based learning (SBL)~\cite{chen2019slice} with a mixture of attentions (MoA) to learn slice-aware dual attentive representations. We empirically show that the MoA approach outperforms the baseline method as well as the original SBL approach on monitored slices with two natural language understanding (NLU) tasks.",0
"Recently developed deep learning architectures have improved state of the art results on many challenging problems such as object detection, image classification and semantic segmentation. These successes can largely attributed to advances in convolutional neural network designs that enable more efficient representation learning. However, despite these advancements there remains large gaps between human performance and the current systems. In our work we develop methods that adaptively selective attention mechanisms during training. Our method learns representations that are optimized for different size chunks (slices) of the input data thereby allowing the model to learn richer features that better capture relevant information from larger spatial contexts. We evaluate our approach using multiple datasets where our models achieve strong results across several tasks including scene understanding, object recognition and medical diagnosis. Finally, we provide analyses showing how models trained with Mixture of Attention perform comparably with respect to other recent approaches while achieving higher accuracy in certain cases.",1
"When a human asks questions online, or when a conversational virtual agent asks human questions, questions triggering emotions or with details might more likely to get responses or answers. we explore how to automatically rewrite natural language questions to improve the response rate from people. In particular, a new task of Visual Question Rewriting(VQR) task is introduced to explore how visual information can be used to improve the new questions. A data set containing around 4K bland questions, attractive questions and images triples is collected. We developed some baseline sequence to sequence models and more advanced transformer based models, which take a bland question and a related image as input and output a rewritten question that is expected to be more attractive. Offline experiments and mechanical Turk based evaluations show that it is possible to rewrite bland questions in a more detailed and attractive way to increase the response rate, and images can be helpful.",0
"Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of visual question rewriting on increasing response rate. We hypothesized that by providing more detailed and specific questions through image manipulation techniques such as highlighting, cropping, and adding arrows, participants would be more likely to provide accurate responses. To test our hypothesis, we conducted two experiments using a repeated measures design where participants were presented with both original and rewritten versions of the same questions. Our results showed that there was indeed a significant increase in response rates for questions with visually rewritten queries compared to those without any modifications. These findings suggest that incorporating image manipulation techniques into survey designs can significantly improve participation rates, ultimately leading to higher quality data collection efforts across different domains. Further research may explore other potential factors affecting response rates, including individual differences and cultural influences. Overall, these findings have important implications for researchers who rely heavily on participant engagement and input.",1
"We consider the problem of Visual Question Answering (VQA). Given an image and a free-form, open-ended, question, expressed in natural language, the goal of VQA system is to provide accurate answer to this question with respect to the image. The task is challenging because it requires simultaneous and intricate understanding of both visual and textual information. Attention, which captures intra- and inter-modal dependencies, has emerged as perhaps the most widely used mechanism for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based architecture to solve VQA. We incorporate an Attention on Attention (AoA) module within encoder-decoder framework, which is able to determine the relation between attention results and queries. Attention module generates weighted average for each query. On the other hand, AoA module first generates an information vector and an attention gate using attention results and current context; and then adds another attention to generate final attended information by multiplying the two. We also propose multimodal fusion module to combine both visual and textual information. The goal of this fusion module is to dynamically decide how much information should be considered from each modality. Extensive experiments on VQA-v2 benchmark dataset show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",0
"Visual question answering (VQA) has emerged as a challenging task that requires both computer vision and natural language processing techniques to successfully solve. One key component of many VQA systems is attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on specific parts of an image when processing questions related to visual content. In this work, we propose an improved attention mechanism for VQA that enhances the ability of models to accurately determine the most relevant image regions for given questions. Our method utilizes dynamic channel-wise feature scaling to learn a global contextual relevance score, allowing the model to selectively attend to different channels within each spatial location based on their importance. We evaluate our proposed method using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement over strong baseline methods. Overall, our results showcase the effectiveness of our improved attention mechanism in improving VQA performance.",1
"While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to image recognition that leverages deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and scalability.

Furthermore, our model can effectively handle high resolution images, opening up new applications in fields such as medical imaging and self-driving cars. Finally, we provide detailed analysis and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards enabling efficient and accurate image understanding algorithms.",1
"With the advent of state of the art nature-inspired pure attention based models i.e. transformers, and their success in natural language processing (NLP), their extension to machine vision (MV) tasks was inevitable and much felt. Subsequently, vision transformers (ViTs) were introduced which are giving quite a challenge to the established deep learning based machine vision techniques. However, pure attention based models/architectures like transformers require huge data, large training times and large computational resources. Some recent works suggest that combinations of these two varied fields can prove to build systems which have the advantages of both these fields. Accordingly, this state of the art survey paper is introduced which hopefully will help readers get useful information about this interesting and potential research area. A gentle introduction to attention mechanisms is given, followed by a discussion of the popular attention based deep architectures. Subsequently, the major categories of the intersection of attention mechanisms and deep learning for machine vision (MV) based are discussed. Afterwards, the major algorithms, issues and trends within the scope of the paper are discussed.",0
This survey article provides an overview of attention mechanisms used in deep neural networks for image recognition tasks.

"Training a reinforcement learning agent to carry out natural language instructions is limited by the available supervision, i.e. knowing when the instruction has been carried out. We adapt the CLEVR visual question answering dataset to generate complex natural language navigation instructions and accompanying scene graphs, yielding an environment-agnostic supervised dataset. To demonstrate the use of this data set, we map the scenes to the VizDoom environment and use the architecture in \citet{gatedattention} to train an agent to carry out these more complex language instructions.",0
"""Ground"" means the process of anchoring things in reality so that they make sense. So a grounded approach might mean you look at the real world implications before taking action on something abstract like instructions: if those instructions lead to confusion, then how could we change them? Perhaps by using pictures! This paper presents a novel use case applying computer vision algorithms to generate graphical scene graphs from everyday natural language navigation instructions (for example, how to walk a dog). These graphs can be used as interfaces between complex machine tasks (such as self driving cars) and simple user requests (""hey car, go pick up my son""). They should also help disambiguate instruction sets during execution (e.g., ""go left"", but which way!?) which seems important for making AIs smarter in the future without needing more compute resources. The key contributions herein include: developing heuristics and software tools capable of generating scene graphs from raw human instructions; presenting evaluation data comparing user input against automatically generated graphs for quality and accuracy; and discussing open research problems impacting the scalability of our model based system moving forward.",1
"Despite their ubiquity in core AI fields like natural language processing, the mechanics of deep attention-based neural networks like the Transformer model are not fully understood. In this article, we present a new perspective towards understanding how Transformers work. In particular, we show that the ""dot-product attention"" that is the core of the Transformer's operation can be characterized as a kernel learning method on a pair of Banach spaces. In particular, the Transformer's kernel is characterized as having an infinite feature dimension. Along the way we consider an extension of the standard kernel learning problem to a binary setting, where data come from two input domains and a response is defined for every cross-domain pair. We prove a new representer theorem for these binary kernel machines with non-Mercer (indefinite, asymmetric) kernels (implying that the functions learned are elements of reproducing kernel Banach spaces rather than Hilbert spaces), and also prove a new universal approximation theorem showing that the Transformer calculation can learn any binary non-Mercer reproducing kernel Banach space pair. We experiment with new kernels in Transformers, and obtain results that suggest the infinite dimensionality of the standard Transformer kernel is partially responsible for its performance. This paper's results provide a new theoretical understanding of a very important but poorly understood model in modern machine~learning.",0
"Title: ""Deep Learning With Non-Mercerizable Kernels""  This paper presents an innovative approach to deep learning by using non-mercerizable kernels to improve performance on a wide range of tasks. Conventional deep learning models rely on Mercer kernels, which have limitations in terms of expressiveness and computational efficiency. By utilizing non-mercerizable kernels instead, we can train more powerful representations that are capable of capturing complex relationships between data points. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Furthermore, our model has the advantage of being able to handle high-dimensional input spaces, such as images and audio signals. Overall, this work advances the field of deep learning by introducing a new class of models that pushes the boundaries of what was previously thought possible.",1
"Self-supervised or weakly supervised models trained on large-scale datasets have shown sample-efficient transfer to diverse datasets in few-shot settings. We consider how upstream pretrained models can be leveraged for downstream few-shot, multilabel, and continual learning tasks. Our model CLIPPER (CLIP PERsonalized) uses image representations from CLIP, a large-scale image representation learning model trained using weak natural language supervision. We developed a technique, called Multi-label Weight Imprinting (MWI), for multi-label, continual, and few-shot learning, and CLIPPER uses MWI with image representations from CLIP. We evaluated CLIPPER on 10 single-label and 5 multi-label datasets. Our model shows robust and competitive performance, and we set new benchmarks for few-shot, multi-label, and continual learning. Our lightweight technique is also compute-efficient and enables privacy-preserving applications as the data is not sent to the upstream model for fine-tuning.",0
"Improving pre-trained language models has become increasingly important as these models have been shown to effectively capture knowledge from large amounts of data and perform well on various natural language processing tasks. However, often times, using such pre-trained models out-of-the-box can result in suboptimal performance due to lack of domain specificity and task adaptability. In this work, we present methods that enable personalization of pre-trained models through fine-tuning and distillation techniques, which improve both accuracy and efficiency. Our approach involves identifying relevant features and parameters in the model that contribute towards better performance while minimizing the risk of overfitting. We demonstrate significant improvements across different domains including sentiment analysis, question answering, and text generation. Our findings show that personalized models not only generalize better but also achieve state-of-the-art results in some cases. This research provides valuable insights into how one can leverage transfer learning to create high performing NLP systems adapted to their needs without incurring the cost of retraining from scratch.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are ubiquitous in computer vision, with a myriad of effective and efficient variations. Recently, Transformers -- originally introduced in natural language processing -- have been increasingly adopted in computer vision. While early adopters continue to employ CNN backbones, the latest networks are end-to-end CNN-free Transformer solutions. A recent surprising finding shows that a simple MLP based solution without any traditional convolutional or Transformer components can produce effective visual representations. While CNNs, Transformers and MLP-Mixers may be considered as completely disparate architectures, we provide a unified view showing that they are in fact special cases of a more general method to aggregate spatial context in a neural network stack. We present the \model (CONText AggregatIon NEtwoRk), a general-purpose building block for multi-head context aggregation that can exploit long-range interactions \emph{a la} Transformers while still exploiting the inductive bias of the local convolution operation leading to faster convergence speeds, often seen in CNNs. In contrast to Transformer-based methods that do not scale well to downstream tasks that rely on larger input image resolutions, our efficient network, named \modellight, can be employed in object detection and instance segmentation networks such as DETR, RetinaNet and Mask-RCNN to obtain an impressive detection mAP of 38.9, 43.8, 45.1 and mask mAP of 41.3, providing large improvements of 6.6, 7.3, 6.9 and 6.6 pts respectively, compared to a ResNet-50 backbone with a comparable compute and parameter size. Our method also achieves promising results on self-supervised learning compared to DeiT on the DINO framework.",0
"Abstract:  This research presents a new deep learning architecture called ""Container"" that uses context aggregation networks (CANs) to improve image classification performance on challenging datasets like COCO and ImageNet. By leveraging CANs, Containers enable effective communication between multiple layers within the network while reducing computational complexity compared to existing methods. We evaluate Containers using several ablation studies, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving accuracy across different dataset sizes and training configurations. Our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art models by achieving higher top-1 and top-5 accuracy on COCO and comparable results on ImageNet. Overall, our work advances the field of computer vision by introducing a simple yet powerful method for enhancing the representation capabilities of convolutional neural networks.",1
"In computer vision and natural language processing, innovations in model architecture that lead to increases in model capacity have reliably translated into gains in performance. In stark contrast with this trend, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often use only small MLPs, and gains in performance typically originate from algorithmic innovations. It is natural to hypothesize that small datasets in RL necessitate simple models to avoid overfitting; however, this hypothesis is untested. In this paper we investigate how RL agents are affected by exchanging the small MLPs with larger modern networks with skip connections and normalization, focusing specifically on soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. We verify, empirically, that na\""ively adopting such architectures leads to instabilities and poor performance, likely contributing to the popularity of simple models in practice. However, we show that dataset size is not the limiting factor, and instead argue that intrinsic instability from the actor in SAC taking gradients through the critic is the culprit. We demonstrate that a simple smoothing method can mitigate this issue, which enables stable training with large modern architectures. After smoothing, larger models yield dramatic performance improvements for state-of-the-art agents -- suggesting that more ""easy"" gains may be had by focusing on model architectures in addition to algorithmic innovations.",0
"In recent years deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training agents that can perform complex sequential decision making tasks. While DRL algorithms have achieved impressive results in many domains, they still face significant challenges due to their limited understanding of the underlying environment and the lack of ability to incorporate prior knowledge into the learning process. This paper presents an overview of some of these limitations and proposes novel methods towards addressing them by leveraging advanced techniques from representation learning, model uncertainty estimation, and meta learning. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on real world benchmarks that our proposed methods significantly improve sample efficiency, scalability and performance over state-of-the art DRL algorithms, paving the pathway toward deeper exploration-exploitation tradeoffs and ultimately achieving more human-like intelligence in artificial agents. Finally, we discuss open research questions and future directions that could lead to even greater breakthroughs in the field. Overall, this work represents a major step forward in developing intelligent agents capable of solving increasingly difficult problems autonomously and efficiently.",1
"Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment video objects with the guidance of natural language reference. Previous methods typically tackle RVOS through directly grounding linguistic reference over the image lattice. Such bottom-up strategy fails to explore object-level cues, easily leading to inferior results. In this work, we instead put forward a two-stage, top-down RVOS solution. First, an exhaustive set of object tracklets is constructed by propagating object masks detected from several sampled frames to the entire video. Second, a Transformer-based tracklet-language grounding module is proposed, which models instance-level visual relations and cross-modal interactions simultaneously and efficiently. Our model ranks first place on CVPR2021 Referring Youtube-VOS challenge.",0
"This is an interesting paper that explores cross-modal interaction from a top-down perspective for referring video object segmentation. In particular, the authors propose a new framework called TSLSNet (Top-Down Spatial Layout Stream Networks) which uses a two-stream architecture to model spatial layout and semantic context jointly with explicit supervision on bounding boxes, category labels, and instance-level masks. This approach enables more accurate reasoning about complex relationships within scenes by leveraging contextual dependencies across multiple modalities. Experiments conducted using DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into advancing the field of referral video object segmentation through novel techniques grounded in cognitive psychology principles.",1
"Pre-trained Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, these models often have billions of parameters, and, thus, are too resource-hungry and computation-intensive to suit low-capability devices or applications with strict latency requirements. One potential remedy for this is model compression, which has attracted a lot of research attention. Here, we summarize the research in compressing Transformers, focusing on the especially popular BERT model. In particular, we survey the state of the art in compression for BERT, we clarify the current best practices for compressing large-scale Transformer models, and we provide insights into the workings of various methods. Our categorization and analysis also shed light on promising future research directions for achieving lightweight, accurate, and generic NLP models.",0
"This paper presents a method for compressing large-scale transformer-based models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluate our approach using a variety of techniques including pruning, quantization, and Huffman coding. Our results show that we can achieve significant compression rates without sacrificing model accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method can be applied to other types of neural networks beyond just those based on the Transformer architecture. Finally, we discuss future directions for research into further improving the efficiency and scalability of deep learning models.",1
"In traditional software programs, we take for granted how easy it is to debug code by tracing program logic from variables back to input, apply unit tests and assertion statements to block erroneous behavior, and compose programs together. But as the programs we write grow more complex, it becomes hard to apply traditional software to applications like computer vision or natural language. Although deep learning programs have demonstrated strong performance on these applications, they sacrifice many of the functionalities of traditional software programs. In this paper, we work towards bridging the benefits of traditional and deep learning programs by jointly training a generative model to constrain neural network activations to ""decode"" back to inputs. Doing so enables practitioners to probe and track information encoded in activation(s), apply assertion-like constraints on what information is encoded in an activation, and compose separate neural networks together in a plug-and-play fashion. In our experiments, we demonstrate applications of decodable representations to out-of-distribution detection, adversarial examples, calibration, and fairness -- while matching standard neural networks in accuracy.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing powerful neural networks that can perform complex tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, despite their impressive performance on benchmark datasets, these models often lack interpretability and transparency. In other words, it is difficult to understand how they make predictions and decisions. One of the main challenges facing researchers is improving the compositionality of neural networks – i.e., ensuring that the outputs are meaningful and interpretable components of the input data.  To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that involves decoding neural network representations back into inputs. By doing so, we can gain insights into how different parts of the input affect the model’s output, as well as identify important features that contribute to its decision making process. We evaluate our method using several state-of-the-art models across multiple domains, including image generation, text completion, and question answering. Our results demonstrate that our proposed technique significantly improves the compositional nature of neural networks, enabling them to produce more explainable and transparent outputs. Overall, our work represents an important step towards building more trustworthy and reliable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Several papers argue that wide minima generalize better than narrow minima. In this paper, through detailed experiments that not only corroborate the generalization properties of wide minima, we also provide empirical evidence for a new hypothesis that the density of wide minima is likely lower than the density of narrow minima. Further, motivated by this hypothesis, we design a novel explore-exploit learning rate schedule. On a variety of image and natural language datasets, compared to their original hand-tuned learning rate baselines, we show that our explore-exploit schedule can result in either up to 0.84% higher absolute accuracy using the original training budget or up to 57% reduced training time while achieving the original reported accuracy. For example, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy for IWSLT'14 (DE-EN) dataset by just modifying the learning rate schedule of a high performing model.",0
"One approach to balancing exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (sticking with what works) is based on the idea that finding the global minimum can be thought of as searching for a dense region of solution space. If we model local search heuristically using Gaussian processes (GPs), we can use variational inference techniques from GP regression to approximate a posterior over functions which includes uncertainty about whether there may still be unknown valleys close by. Then we can define a measure of ""density"" in this space which reflects how far we think other potential solutions might be. This hypothesis suggests then making exploratory steps into more uncertain areas in order to find better optima. We explore some simple instantiations of this intuition and compare their performance on a few benchmark problems where prior work has established baselines; overall our methods perform significantly better than current state-of-the-art blackbox optimizers, while maintaining competitive runtimes with sequential models. In summary we present evidence towards wide minima density as an unifying principle behind several powerful Bayesian optimization algorithms and provide clear empirical justification for this formulation in high dimensions on real-world tasks beyond those used during training.",1
"Questions of fairness, robustness, and transparency are paramount to address before deploying NLP systems. Central to these concerns is the question of reliability: Can NLP systems reliably treat different demographics fairly and function correctly in diverse and noisy environments? To address this, we argue for the need for reliability testing and contextualize it among existing work on improving accountability. We show how adversarial attacks can be reframed for this goal, via a framework for developing reliability tests. We argue that reliability testing -- with an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration -- will enable rigorous and targeted testing, and aid in the enactment and enforcement of industry standards.",0
"Reliability testing has become increasingly important as natural language processing systems (NLPs) continue to play a larger role in our daily lives. NLPs interact with humans through textual interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants, making them essential tools that must provide accurate and reliable answers under all circumstances. In this study, we evaluate three commonly used reliability metrics: recall, precision, and F1 score, and investigate their effectiveness at measuring the accuracy of different types of NLP models. We also compare these reliability metrics against human evaluation methods and demonstrate how they complement each other in assessing NLP system performance. Our results show that while each metric provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of individual NLP systems, a combination of multiple evaluations may yield more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of overall reliability. These findings can guide future research efforts toward creating more robust and effective NLP technologies that better serve end users. This work highlights the need for continuous improvement and rigorous examination of NLP systems, especially those that have significant impact on society.",1
"Machine-learning systems such as self-driving cars or virtual assistants are composed of a large number of machine-learning models that recognize image content, transcribe speech, analyze natural language, infer preferences, rank options, etc. Models in these systems are often developed and trained independently, which raises an obvious concern: Can improving a machine-learning model make the overall system worse? We answer this question affirmatively by showing that improving a model can deteriorate the performance of downstream models, even after those downstream models are retrained. Such self-defeating improvements are the result of entanglement between the models in the system. We perform an error decomposition of systems with multiple machine-learning models, which sheds light on the types of errors that can lead to self-defeating improvements. We also present the results of experiments which show that self-defeating improvements emerge in a realistic stereo-based detection system for cars and pedestrians.",0
"In machine learning, performance improvements may sometimes produce unintended negative consequences that can degrade overall system effectiveness over time. We identify and explore a class of such self-defeating improvements, which we call fixes that fail, where well intentioned modifications actually make things worse rather than better by creating new problems while attempting to solve existing ones. By analyzing real world case studies from industry and research literature, we demonstrate how seemingly innocuous changes can lead to cascading effects throughout the entire system and ultimately reduce overall system utility. We provide guidance on detecting the symptoms of issues that could evolve into full blown fixes that fail, as well as techniques to mitigate their impact before they occur. Our work highlights potential pitfalls facing machine learners today but more importantly provides insights into building robust systems with adaptive capacity to survive them.",1
"Vehicle search is one basic task for the efficient traffic management in terms of the AI City. Most existing practices focus on the image-based vehicle matching, including vehicle re-identification and vehicle tracking. In this paper, we apply one new modality, i.e., the language description, to search the vehicle of interest and explore the potential of this task in the real-world scenario. The natural language-based vehicle search poses one new challenge of fine-grained understanding of both vision and language modalities. To connect language and vision, we propose to jointly train the state-of-the-art vision models with the transformer-based language model in an end-to-end manner. Except for the network structure design and the training strategy, several optimization objectives are also re-visited in this work. The qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method has achieved the 1st place on the 5th AI City Challenge, yielding competitive performance 18.69% MRR accuracy on the private test set. We hope this work can pave the way for the future study on using language description effectively and efficiently for real-world vehicle retrieval systems. The code will be available at https://github.com/ShuaiBai623/AIC2021-T5-CLV.",0
Title: Connecting Language and Vision for Natural Language-Based Vehicle Retrieval,1
"In this article, we introduce a novel variant of the Tsetlin machine (TM) that randomly drops clauses, the key learning elements of a TM. In effect, TM with drop clause ignores a random selection of the clauses in each epoch, selected according to a predefined probability. In this way, additional stochasticity is introduced in the learning phase of TM. Along with producing more distinct and well-structured patterns that improve the performance, we also show that dropping clauses increases learning robustness. To explore the effects clause dropping has on accuracy, training time, and interpretability, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets in natural language processing (NLP) (IMDb and SST2) as well as computer vision (MNIST and CIFAR10). In brief, we observe from +2% to +4% increase in accuracy and 2x to 4x faster learning. We further employ the Convolutional TM to document interpretable results on the CIFAR10 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an interpretable machine learning algorithm has been used to produce pixel-level human-interpretable results on CIFAR10. Also, unlike previous interpretable methods that focus on attention visualisation or gradient interpretability, we show that the TM is a more general interpretable method. That is, by producing rule-based propositional logic expressions that are \emph{human}-interpretable, the TM can explain how it classifies a particular instance at the pixel level for computer vision and at the word level for NLP.",0
"This paper presents a method for enhancing human interpretability in Tsetlin Machines (TM) by introducing drop clauses. By incorporating randomness into clause selection, drop clauses provide an added layer of stochasticity that allows for greater flexibility and interpretabilit",1
"Although Transformer has made breakthrough success in widespread domains especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP), applying it to time series forecasting is still a great challenge. In time series forecasting, the autoregressive decoding of canonical Transformer models could introduce huge accumulative errors inevitably. Besides, utilizing Transformer to deal with spatial-temporal dependencies in the problem still faces tough difficulties.~To tackle these limitations, this work is the first attempt to propose a Non-Autoregressive Transformer architecture for time series forecasting, aiming at overcoming the time delay and accumulative error issues in the canonical Transformer. Moreover, we present a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism, building a bridge by a learned temporal influence map to fill the gaps between the spatial and temporal attention, so that spatial and temporal dependencies can be processed integrally. Empirically, we evaluate our model on diversified ego-centric future localization datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both real-time and accuracy.",0
"This paper presents NAST, a novel neural network architecture designed specifically for time series forecasting tasks. Unlike most existing methods that rely on autoregressive models or require extensive engineering domain knowledge, our approach utilizes non-autoregressive spatial-temporal transformer networks. This allows us to capture complex temporal dependencies while addressing the scalability issues typically faced by traditional sequence modeling techniques. Our experimental results across several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we provide detailed analysis and ablation studies highlighting the benefits of using non-autoregressivity in time series prediction tasks. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in advancing the field of time series forecasting with deep learning models.",1
"A number of problems in the processing of sound and natural language, as well as in other areas, can be reduced to simultaneously reading an input sequence and writing an output sequence of generally different length. There are well developed methods that produce the output sequence based on the entirely known input. However, efficient methods that enable such transformations on-line do not exist. In this paper we introduce an architecture that learns with reinforcement to make decisions about whether to read a token or write another token. This architecture is able to transform potentially infinite sequences on-line. In an experimental study we compare it with state-of-the-art methods for neural machine translation. While it produces slightly worse translations than Transformer, it outperforms the autoencoder with attention, even though our architecture translates texts on-line thereby solving a more difficult problem than both reference methods.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in many areas such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, most deep learning algorithms are based on supervised or unsupervised learning techniques that require large amounts of labeled data, which can be time consuming and expensive to collect. To address these limitations, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising alternative approach for training artificial intelligence agents. RL allows agents to learn from trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties depending on their actions.  In particular, one promising direction of research within RL is sequence transformation, where the agent transforms sequences of input elements into desired output sequences. This problem arises naturally in many real-world applications, including text generation, speech recognition, and robotics. Traditional approaches to sequence transformation have focused mainly on rule-based methods or statistical models. However, these methods suffer from several drawbacks, such as limited generalization ability and poor robustness to noise.  Our work proposes a new model for on-line sequence transformation using deep reinforcement learning. Our method builds upon previous work in RL, but incorporates novel architectural components designed to handle sequential inputs and outputs more effectively. Specifically, we use a recurrent neural network architecture to encode the state of the environment and store information over time. We then train our agent using proximal policy optimization (PPO), a popular RL algorithm known for its stability and sample efficiency.  We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: one for generating human-like speech synthesis and another for controlling simulated robots to reach specific goals. Experimental results show that our method outperforms strong baselines across both tasks, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and speed while requiring fewer training samples. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates good generalizability across different domains, indicating its potential to solve similar problems beyond those studied here. Overall, our work represents an important step towards solving the challe…",1
"In this paper, we introduce Target-Aware Weighted Training (TAWT), a weighted training algorithm for cross-task learning based on minimizing a representation-based task distance between the source and target tasks. We show that TAWT is easy to implement, is computationally efficient, requires little hyperparameter tuning, and enjoys non-asymptotic learning-theoretic guarantees. The effectiveness of TAWT is corroborated through extensive experiments with BERT on four sequence tagging tasks in natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech (PoS) tagging, chunking, predicate detection, and named entity recognition (NER). As a byproduct, the proposed representation-based task distance allows one to reason in a theoretically principled way about several critical aspects of cross-task learning, such as the choice of the source data and the impact of fine-tuning",0
"Here we present weighted training (WT), a simple but effective approach to cross-task learning that leverages insights from transfer learning without explicitly performing fine-tuning. By adjusting the contribution of each task based on their similarity to the target task during model training, WT can achieve better generalization performance than standard multi-task learning methods across several benchmark datasets. Empirical results showcase both improved overall accuracy as well as better calibration compared to competitive baselines. Our findings suggest that our method could have broad implications for natural language processing tasks by allowing models to effectively adapt to new domains while mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, our framework can potentially facilitate researchers interested in applying pretrained language models towards novel application areas where limited labeled data may be available.",1
"Borrowing from the transformer models that revolutionized the field of natural language processing, self-supervised feature learning for visual tasks has also seen state-of-the-art success using these extremely deep, isotropic networks. However, the typical AI researcher does not have the resources to evaluate, let alone train, a model with several billion parameters and quadratic self-attention activations. To facilitate further research, it is necessary to understand the features of these huge transformer models that can be adequately studied by the typical researcher. One interesting characteristic of these transformer models is that they remove most of the inductive biases present in classical convolutional networks. In this work, we analyze the effect of these and more inductive biases on small to moderately-sized isotropic networks used for unsupervised visual feature learning and show that their removal is not always ideal.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) models rely heavily on inductive biases – assumptions encoded into their architectures that enable them to learn complex representations from data. However, many recent developments have focused on removing these constraints altogether and training models without any explicit inductive biases. In this work, we argue that bias against inductive biases can lead to suboptimal model performance and hinder scientific progress. We show how inductive biases play crucial roles in allowing neural networks to capture important properties of the world and facilitating efficient learning through modularity. By analyzing a range of state-of-the-art models across different tasks, we demonstrate that these limitations arise due to insufficient bias rather than excessive bias. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings and suggesting future directions for research in this area. Our results highlight the importance of considering both empirical evidence and theoretical principles in designing effective AI systems.",1
"Purpose: This study evaluates the effectiveness and impact of automated order-based protocol assignment for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL).   Methods: NLP tools were applied to retrospectively process orders from over 116,000 MRI exams with 200 unique sub-specialized protocols (""Local"" protocol class). Separate DL models were trained on 70\% of the processed data for ""Local"" protocols as well as 93 American College of Radiology (""ACR"") protocols and 48 ""General"" protocols. The DL Models were assessed in an ""auto-protocoling (AP)"" inference mode which returns the top recommendation and in a ""clinical decision support (CDS)"" inference mode which returns up to 10 protocols for radiologist review. The accuracy of each protocol recommendation was computed and analyzed based on the difference between the normalized output score of the corresponding neural net for the top two recommendations.   Results: The top predicted protocol in AP mode was correct for 82.8%, 73.8%, and 69.3% of the test cases for ""General"", ""ACR"", and ""Local"" protocol classes, respectively. Higher levels of accuracy over 96% were obtained for all protocol classes in CDS mode. However, at current validation performance levels, the proposed models offer modest, positive, financial impact on large-scale imaging networks.   Conclusions: DL-based protocol automation is feasible and can be tuned to route substantial fractions of exams for auto-protocoling, with higher accuracy with more general protocols. Economic analyses of the tested algorithms indicate that improved algorithm performance is required to yield a practical exam auto-protocoling tool for sub-specialized imaging exams.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. One area where AI can have a significant impact is in automating protocol definition for advanced diagnostic imaging exams. Traditionally, radiologists manually determine which sequences and parameters should be included in these complex exams, which can lead to variability and suboptimal results. In this study, we propose using deep learning techniques to automatically generate optimized imaging protocols that take into account factors such as disease type and patient characteristics. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through experiments on real clinical data, showing improved image quality and robustness compared to traditional manual methods. Our work represents a step towards more efficient and effective use of advanced medical imaging technologies and could ultimately benefit patients by providing higher quality care while reducing exam times and radiation exposure.",1
"Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets contain annotation artefacts resulting in spurious correlations between the natural language utterances and their respective entailment classes. These artefacts are exploited by neural networks even when only considering the hypothesis and ignoring the premise, leading to unwanted biases. Belinkov et al. (2019b) proposed tackling this problem via adversarial training, but this can lead to learned sentence representations that still suffer from the same biases. We show that the bias can be reduced in the sentence representations by using an ensemble of adversaries, encouraging the model to jointly decrease the accuracy of these different adversaries while fitting the data. This approach produces more robust NLI models, outperforming previous de-biasing efforts when generalised to 12 other datasets (Belinkov et al., 2019a; Mahabadi et al., 2020). In addition, we find that the optimal number of adversarial classifiers depends on the dimensionality of the sentence representations, with larger sentence representations being more difficult to de-bias while benefiting from using a greater number of adversaries.",0
"Effectively measuring natural language inference (NLI) performance has been hindered by what we call the ""hypothesis-only"" bias: existing metrics only consider whether a hypothesis matches a premise sentence and ignore potentially important differences among hypotheses that may indicate one is preferred over another. To address this problem, we introduce adversarial training to encourage NLI models to predict multiple alternative plausible hypotheses that better reflect different interpretations underlying both premises; our method achieves improved correlations compared to human annotations on four benchmark datasets (SNLI, HANS, SciTail, and TriviaQA). We argue that ensemble methods that capture more diverse knowledge sources can mitigate the limitations of individual systems---our framework, Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT), represents a promising approach towards robust evaluation of NLI models and other tasks requiring reasoning beyond simple pattern matching.",1
"This paper presents a new Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture Multi-Scale Vision Longformer, which significantly enhances the ViT of \cite{dosovitskiy2020image} for encoding high-resolution images using two techniques. The first is the multi-scale model structure, which provides image encodings at multiple scales with manageable computational cost. The second is the attention mechanism of vision Longformer, which is a variant of Longformer \cite{beltagy2020longformer}, originally developed for natural language processing, and achieves a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of input tokens. A comprehensive empirical study shows that the new ViT significantly outperforms several strong baselines, including the existing ViT models and their ResNet counterparts, and the Pyramid Vision Transformer from a concurrent work \cite{wang2021pyramid}, on a range of vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The models and source code are released at \url{https://github.com/microsoft/vision-longformer}.",0
"In recent years, vision transformers have emerged as powerful models that achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, these models suffer from computational limitations due to their reliance on self-attention mechanisms. These difficulties become even more pronounced for high-resolution images, which are difficult to process using existing transformer architectures. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Scale Vision Longformer (MVL), a new vision transformer architecture designed specifically for encoding high-resolution images at multiple scales. MVL leverages multi-scale processing by applying downsampling operations at different points during encoding, allowing for efficient computation while capturing crucial contextual relationships among pixels at varying spatial resolutions. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model across several benchmark datasets and applications such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. We conclude that MVL is capable of achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer computations compared to previous approaches, making it well suited for resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing and mobile devices. Overall, MVL represents a significant step forward in enabling effective and efficient processing of complex visual data within vision transformers.",1
"Transformer networks are effective at modeling long-range contextual information and have recently demonstrated exemplary performance in the natural language processing domain. Conventionally, the temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) task is divided into two main sub-tasks: boundary prediction and proposal confidence prediction, which rely on the frame-level dependencies and proposal-level relationships separately. To capture the dependencies at different levels of granularity, this paper intuitively presents a unified temporal action proposal generation framework with original Transformers, called TAPG Transformer, which consists of a Boundary Transformer and a Proposal Transformer. Specifically, the Boundary Transformer captures long-term temporal dependencies to predict precise boundary information and the Proposal Transformer learns the rich inter-proposal relationships for reliable confidence evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular benchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, and the results demonstrate that TAPG Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Equipped with the existing action classifier, our method achieves remarkable performance on the temporal action localization task. Codes and models will be available.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in natural language processing using deep learning techniques such as transformers. One area that has seen particular advancement is action proposal generation (APG), which involves generating candidate actions based on natural language input. However, most existing APG models focus solely on the present tense, ignoring temporal relationships between actions. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect proposals, particularly for complex tasks involving multiple steps over time. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Temporal Action Proposal Generation with Transformers (TAPRO). Our method uses transformer networks to encode both spatial and temporal information, allowing us to generate more accurate and complete sets of actions across different time frames. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, TAPRO represents a promising new direction for NLP research and has the potential to enable more advanced applications in areas such as robotics and intelligent assistants.",1
"Interactive robots navigating photo-realistic environments face challenges underlying vision-and-language navigation (VLN), but in addition, they need to be trained to handle the dynamic nature of dialogue. However, research in Cooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (CVDN), where a navigator interacts with a guide in natural language in order to reach a goal, treats the dialogue history as a VLN-style static instruction. In this paper, we present VISITRON, a navigator better suited to the interactive regime inherent to CVDN by being trained to: i) identify and associate object-level concepts and semantics between the environment and dialogue history, ii) identify when to interact vs. navigate via imitation learning of a binary classification head. We perform extensive ablations with VISITRON to gain empirical insights and improve performance on CVDN. VISITRON is competitive with models on the static CVDN leaderboard. We also propose a generalized interactive regime to fine-tune and evaluate VISITRON and future such models with pre-trained guides for adaptability.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can accurately classify objects within images, especially those with complex backgrounds. One promising approach is to utilize visual semantics, which involves analyzing the relationships between different objects and their surroundings within an image. This allows for more accurate classification by taking into account contextual cues.  This paper presents a new algorithm called VISITRON (Visual Semantics-Aligned Interactively Trained Object-Navigator) that leverages visual semantics to improve object detection accuracy in cluttered scenes. Unlike existing methods, VISITRON combines both supervised and interactive learning techniques to achieve better results. Specifically, VISITRON first pretrains on large amounts of labeled data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Then, a human operator provides feedback on the model's initial predictions, guiding the system towards more accurate detections through an iterative process. By incorporating this user input, VISITRON can adapt to specific domains and tasks and learn from human expertise.  Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we show that the combined use of supervised and interactive training leads to significant performance improvements over single-mode approaches. Our findings suggest that integrating human intelligence into computer vision systems can lead to enhanced object recognition capabilities in complex scenarios. Overall, VISITRON represents an important step forward in understanding how humans and machines can collaborate effectively to solve real-world problems in artificial intelligence.",1
"Recently, learning a model that generalizes well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data has attracted great attention in the machine learning community. In this paper, after defining OOD generalization via Wasserstein distance, we theoretically show that a model robust to input perturbation generalizes well on OOD data. Inspired by previous findings that adversarial training helps improve input-robustness, we theoretically show that adversarially trained models have converged excess risk on OOD data, and empirically verify it on both image classification and natural language understanding tasks. Besides, in the paradigm of first pre-training and then fine-tuning, we theoretically show that a pre-trained model that is more robust to input perturbation provides a better initialization for generalization on downstream OOD data. Empirically, after fine-tuning, this better-initialized model from adversarial pre-training also has better OOD generalization.",0
"Abstract: This work proposes an improved method for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization using adversarial training and pre-training techniques. In recent years, deep learning models have demonstrated impressive performance on many tasks, but their ability to generalize well beyond their training data remains limited. One reason for this limitation is that these models often struggle to identify instances from different distributions as belonging to separate groups rather than simply representing random variation within a single distribution. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging both adversarial training and pre-training methods in order to improve model robustness and promote better OOD generalization. Our approach involves training a generative adversarial network to produce synthetic examples that can confuse the original classifier. These generated images are then used during fine-tuning to enhance the capacity of our model to distinguish real samples from generated ones. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and LSUN, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing approaches. Overall, our study suggests that incorporating both adversarial training and pre-training techniques provides significant benefits in terms of enhancing OOD generalization abilities.",1
"Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or offices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a target object, we jointly reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in; the same type of container will have a different probability of having the target depending on the room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic information to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects are best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We propose to use a 3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and geometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search process, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that guides an agent's actions towards finding a target object specified with a natural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network architecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual, geometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of the graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a novel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically related objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better than several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in terms of the median number of actions required. Additional qualitative results can be found at https://ai.stanford.edu/mech-search/hms.",0
"Title: Semantic and Geometric Modeling with Neural Message Passing in 3D Scene Graphs for Hierarchical Mechanical Search  Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for semantic and geometric modeling of complex 3D scenes using neural message passing in scene graphs. Traditional methods for modeling such scenes rely on manual encoding and feature engineering. However, these approaches can be time-consuming and may miss important contextual details. Our proposed method leverages advances in deep learning to automatically learn representations that capture both the semantic and geometric structure of the scene. We use graph convolutional networks (GCN) to encode relationships among objects in the scene graph. This enables us to capture spatial relationships between nodes while preserving their hierarchical organization. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attention mechanism that allows us to selectively focus on specific features or aspects of the scene at each iteration of message passing. By doing so, our model can better represent fine-grained differences across different scenarios and variations. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach outperforms existing baseline methods on challenging benchmark datasets for mechanical search problems involving complex 3D scenes. These results suggest that our model holds great potential for enabling more advanced applications in areas such as computer graphics, robotics, and virtual reality.",1
"Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild is extremely challenging due to occlusions, variant head poses, face deformation and motion blur under unconstrained conditions. Although substantial progresses have been made in automatic FER in the past few decades, previous studies are mainly designed for lab-controlled FER. Real-world occlusions, variant head poses and other issues definitely increase the difficulty of FER on account of these information-deficient regions and complex backgrounds. Different from previous pure CNNs based methods, we argue that it is feasible and practical to translate facial images into sequences of visual words and perform expression recognition from a global perspective. Therefore, we propose Convolutional Visual Transformers to tackle FER in the wild by two main steps. First, we propose an attentional selective fusion (ASF) for leveraging the feature maps generated by two-branch CNNs. The ASF captures discriminative information by fusing multiple features with global-local attention. The fused feature maps are then flattened and projected into sequences of visual words. Second, inspired by the success of Transformers in natural language processing, we propose to model relationships between these visual words with global self-attention. The proposed method are evaluated on three public in-the-wild facial expression datasets (RAF-DB, FERPlus and AffectNet). Under the same settings, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows superior performance over other methods, setting new state of the art on RAF-DB with 88.14%, FERPlus with 88.81% and AffectNet with 61.85%. We also conduct cross-dataset evaluation on CK+ show the generalization capability of the proposed method.",0

"Automated image captioning is one of the applications of Deep Learning which involves fusion of work done in computer vision and natural language processing, and it is typically performed using Encoder-Decoder architectures. In this project, we have implemented and experimented with various flavors of multi-modal image captioning networks where ResNet101, DenseNet121 and VGG19 based CNN Encoders and Attention based LSTM Decoders were explored. We have studied the effect of beam size and the use of pretrained word embeddings and compared them to baseline CNN encoder and RNN decoder architecture. The goal is to analyze the performance of each approach using various evaluation metrics including BLEU, CIDEr, ROUGE and METEOR.

We also investigate the impact of pretraining strategies and fine-tuning techniques on model performance. Overall, we conclude that deep learning holds great promise for automating image captioning tasks and provide recommendations for future research directions in this area.",1
"In this paper, we consider hybrid parallelism -- a paradigm that employs both Data Parallelism (DP) and Model Parallelism (MP) -- to scale distributed training of large recommendation models. We propose a compression framework called Dynamic Communication Thresholding (DCT) for communication-efficient hybrid training. DCT filters the entities to be communicated across the network through a simple hard-thresholding function, allowing only the most relevant information to pass through. For communication efficient DP, DCT compresses the parameter gradients sent to the parameter server during model synchronization. The threshold is updated only once every few thousand iterations to reduce the computational overhead of compression. For communication efficient MP, DCT incorporates a novel technique to compress the activations and gradients sent across the network during the forward and backward propagation, respectively. This is done by identifying and updating only the most relevant neurons of the neural network for each training sample in the data. We evaluate DCT on publicly available natural language processing and recommender models and datasets, as well as recommendation systems used in production at Facebook. DCT reduces communication by at least $100\times$ and $20\times$ during DP and MP, respectively. The algorithm has been deployed in production, and it improves end-to-end training time for a state-of-the-art industrial recommender model by 37\%, without any loss in performance.",0
"Here’s a possible abstract for this work:  In recent years, recommender systems have become increasingly important tools for making personalized predictions and recommendations based on large amounts of data.

We demonstrate how our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and scalability by applying it to real-world datasets from different domains such as entertainment, online shopping, and news aggregation. Our results show that the proposed system achieves significantly better rankings than baseline models, improving user satisfaction and engagement while reducing computation costs. This research has implications for industry practitioners looking to improve recommendation quality, efficiency, and performance, ultimately leading to improved user experiences and business success.",1
"Attention layers are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and are beginning to influence computer vision architectures. Training very large transformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once trained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance, it is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy. This work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact. Motivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query projections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables heads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of parameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in any transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query dimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and vision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained multi-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer. Collaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query projections by 4 for same accuracy and speed. Our code is public.",0

In contrast to previous methods that concatenate vectors from different sources to form a single representation, multi-head attention allows these vectors to collaborate with one another as they learn about their context within the sequence. This method enables parallel computation over the sequence elements, allowing more efficient modeling than prior approaches. By employing novel mechanisms for scaling dot-products, the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on several challenging natural language processing tasks. Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture for analyzing complex sequential data.",1
"Smart home environments are designed to provide services that help improve the quality of life for the occupant via a variety of sensors and actuators installed throughout the space. Many automated actions taken by a smart home are governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system. However, activity recognition systems may not be perfectly accurate and therefore inconsistencies in smart home operations can lead a user to wonder ""why did the smart home do that?"" In this work, we build on insights from Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to contribute computational methods for explainable activity recognition. Specifically, we generate explanations for smart home activity recognition systems that explain what about an activity led to the given classification. To do so, we introduce four computational techniques for generating natural language explanations of smart home data and compare their effectiveness at generating meaningful explanations. Through a study with everyday users, we evaluate user preferences towards the four explanation types. Our results show that the leading approach, SHAP, has a 92% success rate in generating accurate explanations. Moreover, 84% of sampled scenarios users preferred natural language explanations over a simple activity label, underscoring the need for explainable activity recognition systems. Finally, we show that explanations generated by some XAI methods can lead users to lose confidence in the accuracy of the underlying activity recognition model, while others lead users to gain confidence. Taking all studied factors into consideration, we make a recommendation regarding which existing XAI method leads to the best performance in the domain of smart home automation, and discuss a range of topics for future work in this area.",0
"Activity recognition has become increasingly important as smart home systems have gained popularity. Understanding human behavior within these environments can lead to better automation, personalization, and assistance. However, current activity recognition methods often lack transparency and interpretability, which limits their adoption and trustworthiness. In this work, we propose an explainable approach that utilizes natural language processing techniques to generate descriptions of activities based on sensor data. Our method first maps raw sensor readings into semantic meaning representations using pre-trained models. Then, it generates textual explanations by reasoning over those intermediate representations through graph algorithms that model relationships between actions and objects present in a scene. We evaluate our approach across multiple datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while providing detailed explanations for each recognized action. This study represents a significant step towards more comprehensible and reliable activity recognition solutions for smart homes. Future research directions and potential applications are discussed.",1
"Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is the basic of Chinese natural language processing (NLP). The quality of word segmentation will directly affect the rest of NLP tasks. Recently, with the artificial intelligence tide rising again, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, as one of easily modeling in sequence, has been widely utilized in various kinds of NLP tasks, and functions well. Attention mechanism is an ingenious method to solve the memory compression problem on LSTM. Furthermore, inspired by the powerful abilities of bidirectional LSTM models for modeling sequence and CRF model for decoding, we propose a Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Attention-based Model in this paper. Experiments on PKU and MSRA benchmark datasets show that our model performs better than the baseline methods modeling by other neural networks.",0
"This paper presents a novel bidirectional LSTM-CRF attention-based model (BLSTMCA) that significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets by exploiting interdependencies among character contexts. Our approach combines both biLSTM and convolutional neural network architectures while explicitly considering character dependencies through conditional random fields (CRF). We apply selfattention mechanisms to focus specifically on important character features, which allows us to better handle OOV characters than previous models. Experiments demonstrate our BLSTMCA achieves substantial improvements over existing solutions, including those based on CRF alone. Additionally, we explore the robustness of our system against noise insertion during training time and observe only minor degradations in performance. These findings confirm the effectiveness and applicability of our method as a standalone segmenter or incorporated into larger language processing pipelines.",1
"Leveraging the advances of natural language processing, most recent scene text recognizers adopt an encoder-decoder architecture where text images are first converted to representative features and then a sequence of characters via `direct decoding'. However, scene text images suffer from rich noises of different sources such as complex background and geometric distortions which often confuse the decoder and lead to incorrect alignment of visual features at noisy decoding time steps. This paper presents I2C2W, a novel scene text recognizer that is accurate and tolerant to various noises in scenes. I2C2W consists of an image-to-character module (I2C) and a character-to-word module (C2W) which are complementary and can be trained end-to-end. I2C detects characters and predicts their relative positions in a word. It strives to detect all possible characters including incorrect and redundant ones based on different alignments of visual features without the restriction of time steps. Taking the detected characters as input, C2W learns from character semantics and their positions to filter out incorrect and redundant detection and produce the final word recognition. Extensive experiments over seven public datasets show that I2C2W achieves superior recognition performances and outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins on challenging irregular scene text datasets.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for scene text recognition using transformer models. We introduce a novel architecture called Image-to-Character-to-Word (I2C2W) transformers that directly predicts character sequences from input images without any intermediate steps such as detecting characters first. Our model is designed specifically for handling real world scenarios where we observe significant variation in scale, aspect ratio and background clutter present in images, making traditional approaches less effective. We evaluate our proposed method on publicly available datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous methods across all benchmark metrics including accuracy, precision and recall. Finally, we analyze the learned representation spaces by visualizing attention maps which provide insights into the decision making process of our model leading to improved understanding of these systems",1
"Performance of recommender systems (RS) relies heavily on the amount of training data available. This poses a chicken-and-egg problem for early-stage products, whose amount of data, in turn, relies on the performance of their RS. On the other hand, zero-shot learning promises some degree of generalization from an old dataset to an entirely new dataset. In this paper, we explore the possibility of zero-shot learning in RS. We develop an algorithm, dubbed ZEro-Shot Recommenders (ZESRec), that is trained on an old dataset and generalize to a new one where there are neither overlapping users nor overlapping items, a setting that contrasts typical cross-domain RS that has either overlapping users or items. Different from categorical item indices, i.e., item ID, in previous methods, ZESRec uses items' natural-language descriptions (or description embeddings) as their continuous indices, and therefore naturally generalize to any unseen items. In terms of users, ZESRec builds upon recent advances on sequential RS to represent users using their interactions with items, thereby generalizing to unseen users as well. We study two pairs of real-world RS datasets and demonstrate that ZESRec can successfully enable recommendations in such a zero-shot setting, opening up new opportunities for resolving the chicken-and-egg problem for data-scarce startups or early-stage products.",0
"Abstract: The success of modern recommender systems largely depends on their ability to capture complex relationships among users, items, and features through effective modeling techniques such as collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of labeled training data which can be expensive and time consuming to collect. As a result, there has been growing interest in developing zero-shot learning models that can effectively make recommendations without any prior knowledge of user preferences or item characteristics. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with zero-shot learning principles to achieve accurate recommendation outcomes across a wide range of datasets and evaluation metrics. Our approach leverages multi-modal representations that encode both semantic and visual information about items into embeddings, making our method highly scalable and applicable to diverse recommendation scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model significantly improves upon existing baselines while reducing computational cost compared to traditional CF methods. We hope this work will contribute towards bridging the gap between high quality recommendations and efficient resource usage in real-world applications.",1
"When working to understand usage of a data format, examples of the data format are often more representative than the format's specification. For example, two different applications might use very different JSON representations, or two PDF-writing applications might make use of very different areas of the PDF specification to realize the same rendered content. The complexity arising from these distinct origins can lead to large, difficult-to-understand attack surfaces, presenting a security concern when considering both exfiltration and data schizophrenia. Grammar inference can aid in describing the practical language generator behind examples of a data format. However, most grammar inference research focuses on natural language, not data formats, and fails to support crucial features such as type recursion. We propose a novel set of mechanisms for grammar inference, RL-GRIT, and apply them to understanding de facto data formats. After reviewing existing grammar inference solutions, it was determined that a new, more flexible scaffold could be found in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Within this work, we lay out the many algorithmic changes required to adapt RL from its traditional, sequential-time environment to the highly interdependent environment of parsing. The result is an algorithm which can demonstrably learn recursive control structures in simple data formats, and can extract meaningful structure from fragments of the PDF format. Whereas prior work in grammar inference focused on either regular languages or constituency parsing, we show that RL can be used to surpass the expressiveness of both classes, and offers a clear path to learning context-sensitive languages. The proposed algorithm can serve as a building block for understanding the ecosystems of de facto data formats.",0
"This abstract presents RL-GRIT, which stands for “Reinforcement Learning for Grammar Inference”. Our approach takes advantage of two key insights to scale up unsupervised grammar inference using deep learning methods. Firstly, we apply recent advances in meta-learning to enable our model to rapidly adapt to new grammatical systems by leveraging experiences gained from solving prior tasks, including those that arise in diverse languages. Second, rather than directly predicting target structures, we train recurrent models to perform online repair operations guided by neural string edit distance minimization. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on several benchmark tests of cross-linguistic generality, where our method significantly outperforms strong baseline techniques without handcrafted features. These results support the viability of our novel meta-learning framework for efficient acquisition of complex linguistic knowledge, holding promise both as a foundation for future work on language generation and natural language understanding problems, and perhaps ultimately for enabling machine translation without explicit supervision.",1
"Given a natural language expression and an image/video, the goal of referring segmentation is to produce the pixel-level masks of the entities described by the subject of the expression. Previous approaches tackle this problem by implicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic modalities in a one-stage manner. However, human tends to solve the referring problem in a progressive manner based on informative words in the expression, i.e., first roughly locating candidate entities and then distinguishing the target one. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension (CMPC) scheme to effectively mimic human behaviors and implement it as a CMPC-I (Image) module and a CMPC-V (Video) module to improve referring image and video segmentation models. For image data, our CMPC-I module first employs entity and attribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered by the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the target entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by spatial graph reasoning. For video data, our CMPC-V module further exploits action words based on CMPC-I to highlight the correct entity matched with the action cues by temporal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC, we also introduce a simple yet effective Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to integrate the reasoned multimodal features corresponding to different levels in the visual backbone under the guidance of textual information. In this way, multi-level features can communicate with each other and be mutually refined based on the textual context. Combining CMPC-I or CMPC-V with TGFE can form our image or video version referring segmentation frameworks and our frameworks achieve new state-of-the-art performances on four referring image segmentation benchmarks and three referring video segmentation benchmarks respectively.",0
"This paper presents a novel algorithm for cross-modal referring segmentation using deep learning techniques that allows for progressive comprehension across modalities. We describe how our model can learn from visual prompts to generate text descriptions, which can then be used as input to refine the referred object region. Our approach uses a variational autoencoder framework coupled with adversarial training, allowing us to effectively model both the uncertainties in the learned representation and the discrepancies between different modalities. Experiments on several challenging datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin while reducing computational costs. We believe that our work represents an important step forward towards truly efficient and effective multi-modal understanding systems, capable of seamlessly integrating data from multiple sources.",1
"Explaining the behavior of black box machine learning models through human interpretable rules is an important research area. Recent work has focused on explaining model behavior locally i.e. for specific predictions as well as globally across the fields of vision, natural language, reinforcement learning and data science. We present a novel model-agnostic approach that derives rules to globally explain the behavior of classification models trained on numerical and/or categorical data. Our approach builds on top of existing local model explanation methods to extract conditions important for explaining model behavior for specific instances followed by an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes an information theory based fitness function to construct rules that explain global model behavior. We show how our approach outperforms existing approaches on a variety of datasets. Further, we introduce a parameter to evaluate the quality of interpretation under the scenario of distributional shift. This parameter evaluates how well the interpretation can predict model behavior for previously unseen data distributions. We show how existing approaches for interpreting models globally lack distributional robustness. Finally, we show how the quality of the interpretation can be improved under the scenario of distributional shift by adding out of distribution samples to the dataset used to learn the interpretation and thereby, increase robustness. All of the datasets used in our paper are open and publicly available. Our approach has been deployed in a leading digital marketing suite of products.",0
"This is an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and biologists aimed at understanding how explanations for complex natural phenomena emerge from large data sets. We develop a mathematical framework based on information theory that allows us to quantify and compare different types of global explanations across multiple levels of organization (e.g., genotype–phenotype maps, gene regulatory networks). Using high performance computing resources we then apply our methodology to genomics data, showing that some well known principles of human health make perfect sense within the model agnostic information-based framework we introduce here. These findings could lead to the development of new strategies for early disease diagnosis or drug discovery. The broad applicability of these results to other domains of science and technology highlights both a need for a deeper theoretical understanding of scientific explanation as well as new machine learning algorithms capable of generating explanations de novo. While work remains before these goals can be achieved, the present study represents one step toward them by formalizing relevant aspects of the process via information theory.",1
"Language-queried video actor segmentation aims to predict the pixel-level mask of the actor which performs the actions described by a natural language query in the target frames. Existing methods adopt 3D CNNs over the video clip as a general encoder to extract a mixed spatio-temporal feature for the target frame. Though 3D convolutions are amenable to recognizing which actor is performing the queried actions, it also inevitably introduces misaligned spatial information from adjacent frames, which confuses features of the target frame and yields inaccurate segmentation. Therefore, we propose a collaborative spatial-temporal encoder-decoder framework which contains a 3D temporal encoder over the video clip to recognize the queried actions, and a 2D spatial encoder over the target frame to accurately segment the queried actors. In the decoder, a Language-Guided Feature Selection (LGFS) module is proposed to flexibly integrate spatial and temporal features from the two encoders. We also propose a Cross-Modal Adaptive Modulation (CMAM) module to dynamically recombine spatial- and temporal-relevant linguistic features for multimodal feature interaction in each stage of the two encoders. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks with less computational overhead than previous approaches.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest from both industry and academia in developing methods that can automatically segment actors from complex videos containing multiple performers, motion blur, occlusions, and other challenges. This problem remains difficult even for state-of-the-art techniques due to the wide variety of scenes found in movies, TV shows, plays, dances, and online videos, among others. This article describes how natural language queries can significantly improve actor segmentation accuracy by providing strong priors about scene context, object relationships, human postures and movements, camera motion, and visual cues such as color or texture. We show how deep neural networks trained on large datasets of video frames, annotations, and natural language descriptions can learn latent representations that capture these diverse factors while enabling efficient inference using standard graphics processing units (GPUs). Our system processes input video streams frame-by-frame, taking into account previously predicted masks, new sensor data, and textual guidance. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over baseline approaches across a range of scenarios without relying exclusively on any particular task-specific features.",1
"This paper is based on a machine learning project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, fall 2020. The project was initiated with a literature review on the latest developments within time-series forecasting methods in the scientific community over the past five years. The paper summarizes the essential aspects of this research. Furthermore, in this paper, we introduce an LSTM cell's architecture, and explain how different components go together to alter the cell's memory and predict the output. Also, the paper provides the necessary formulas and foundations to calculate a forward iteration through an LSTM. Then, the paper refers to some practical applications and research that emphasize the strength and weaknesses of LSTMs, shown within the time-series domain and the natural language processing (NLP) domain. Finally, alternative statistical methods for time series predictions are highlighted, where the paper outline ARIMA and exponential smoothing. Nevertheless, as LSTMs can be viewed as a complex architecture, the paper assumes that the reader has some knowledge of essential machine learning aspects, such as the multi-layer perceptron, activation functions, overfitting, backpropagation, bias, over- and underfitting, and more.",0
"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis and speech recognition because they can effectively capture temporal patterns from sequential data. However, vanilla recurrent architectures like LSTM suffer from the gradient exploding/vanishing problem which makes training them difficult. In this work, we propose Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture (LS-RNN), that combines memory cell state with forget gate gating mechanism that controls flow of gradients to enable better optimization by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and improving the stability and accuracy of RNN models. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets for five different NLP tasks, including text classification, machine translation and sentiment analysis and show consistent improvements over baseline systems using both LSTM and GRU cells.",1
"Real-world data often exhibit imbalanced distributions, where certain target values have significantly fewer observations. Existing techniques for dealing with imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., different classes. However, many tasks involve continuous targets, where hard boundaries between classes do not exist. We define Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) as learning from such imbalanced data with continuous targets, dealing with potential missing data for certain target values, and generalizing to the entire target range. Motivated by the intrinsic difference between categorical and continuous label space, we propose distribution smoothing for both labels and features, which explicitly acknowledges the effects of nearby targets, and calibrates both label and learned feature distributions. We curate and benchmark large-scale DIR datasets from common real-world tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains. Extensive experiments verify the superior performance of our strategies. Our work fills the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical imbalanced regression problems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/YyzHarry/imbalanced-regression.",0
"The paper presents an overview of deep imbalanced regression, which refers to the use of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks and decision trees to predict continuous outcomes from datasets where one class has far more instances than the other classes. This can lead to biased predictions that favor the majority class, so we need methods to address class imbalances like resampling techniques like undersampling and oversampling. We discuss these challenges and present our own approach using generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs have proven effective at generating synthetic data samples that closely mimic real examples, but their utility for improving regression models remains unexplored. Our experiments show promising results: generated samples can reduce bias by upweighting minority instances; using them for model training leads to better performance across metrics on benchmark datasets; we provide analysis comparing different strategies for integrating generated samples. These findings make an important contribution to handling imbalance in regression problems and highlight new opportunities for leveraging GANs beyond image generation tasks they were primarily designed for.",1
"Spherical data is distributed on the sphere. The data appears in various fields such as meteorology, biology, and natural language processing. However, a method for analysis of spherical data does not develop enough yet. One of the important issues is an estimation of the number of clusters in spherical data. To address the issue, I propose a new method called the Spherical X-means (SX-means) that can estimate the number of clusters on d-dimensional sphere. The SX-means is the model-based method assuming that the data is generated from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. The present paper explains the proposed method and shows its performance of estimation of the number of clusters.",0
"Here we consider estimation of the number of clusters from data sampled uniformly at random across the surface of a D-dimensional unit sphere S^D. For convenience we restrict attention to even dimensions (although most results extend directly to odd dimensions) with an integer M such that D = 2M or D=2M+1; thus the dimension ranges from two upwards. We are interested in estimating K, which is assumed fixed throughout. Data were generated by drawing N independent samples each containing P points; the total size of the data set was thus NP (and we took M=N, so N>D). Several alternative methods of estimating K were considered: using nearest neighbour distance matrices either via singular value decomposition with low-rank approximation, or else through kernel density estimates with bandwidth determined locally; both techniques yielded comparable results. Simulations showed how well these clustering algorithms worked as functions of several variables, including P,N,K, andD. Overall, though some regimes gave disappointing performance, good accuracy could typically be obtained over wide swathes of parameter space. However, all simulations used perfect knowledge of true underlying geometry of clustering – i.e., we knew apriori where centroids lay. In practice such geometric information may itself need to be estimated, complicating matters further still; but preliminary work indicates that this too can be done reasonably accurately, and we hope shortly to report fully on our investigations into this more realistic scenario",1
"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied to a broad range of applications, including natural language processing, drug discovery, and video recognition. Their vulnerability to input perturbation is also known. Aligning with a view from software defect detection, this paper aims to develop a coverage guided testing approach to systematically exploit the internal behaviour of RNNs, with the expectation that such testing can detect defects with high possibility. Technically, the long short term memory network (LSTM), a major class of RNNs, is thoroughly studied. A family of three test metrics are designed to quantify not only the values but also the temporal relations (including both step-wise and bounded-length) exhibited when LSTM processing inputs. A genetic algorithm is applied to efficiently generate test cases. The test metrics and test case generation algorithm are implemented into a tool TestRNN, which is then evaluated on a set of LSTM benchmarks. Experiments confirm that TestRNN has advantages over the state-of-art tool DeepStellar and attack-based defect detection methods, owing to its working with finer temporal semantics and the consideration of the naturalness of input perturbation. Furthermore, TestRNN enables meaningful information to be collected and exhibited for users to understand the testing results, which is an important step towards interpretable neural network testing.",0
"""Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely used for natural language processing tasks such as text generation and sentiment analysis due to their ability to capture sequential patterns from input data. However, testing RNNs can be challenging because they generate outputs over time steps, making it difficult to determine whether all valid output sequences have been covered by test cases.  Coverage guided testing (CGT) is a software testing approach that uses coverage metrics, such as branch coverage or path coverage, to systematically improve test suite quality through iterative refinement. CGT has proven effective in improving the fault detection rate for non-recursive programs but applying CGT to RNNs presents several new challenges. Firstly, due to their feedback loop structure, generating meaningful coverages requires reasoning about future program states. Secondly, defining meaningful covers for arbitrary long inputs and different network architectures remains open. Lastly, most existing approaches require manual effort or significant domain knowledge to define these criteria.  This work addresses these challenges by proposing an automated method called Coverage Guided Testing for Recurrent Neural Networks (CGTRNN). Our proposed method leverages recent advances in model checking for probabilistic systems to efficiently compute reachable output distributions under given test trajectories starting at different internal states. These computed outputs, including the probability distribution values, allow us to automatically formulate meaningfulcoverages based on a user-specified threshold. Additionally, we propose heuristics tailored specifically for RNNs which substantially reduce the search space required for generating diverse testcases. By integrating these methods into our approach, we demonstrate how CGTRNN significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple benchmark problems drawn from real use cases.""",1
"Source code summarization aims to generate natural language summaries from structured code snippets for better understanding code functionalities. However, automatic code summarization is challenging due to the complexity of the source code and the language gap between the source code and natural language summaries. Most previous approaches either rely on retrieval-based (which can take advantage of similar examples seen from the retrieval database, but have low generalization performance) or generation-based methods (which have better generalization performance, but cannot take advantage of similar examples). This paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented mechanism to combine the benefits of both worlds. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on capturing global graph structure information of source code, we propose a novel attention-based dynamic graph to complement the static graph representation of the source code, and design a hybrid message passing GNN for capturing both the local and global structural information. To evaluate the proposed approach, we release a new challenging benchmark, crawled from diversified large-scale open-source C projects (total 95k+ unique functions in the dataset). Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, improving existing methods by 1.42, 2.44 and 1.29 in terms of BLEU-4, ROUGE-L and METEOR.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing natural language processing (NLP) techniques that can automatically generate summaries of source code for developers.

"Graph Neural Networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from drug discovery, recommendation systems, image classification, social network analysis to natural language understanding. This paper shows their efficacy in modeling relationships between products and making predictions for unseen product networks. By representing products as nodes and their relationships as edges of a graph, we show how an inductive graph neural network approach, named GraphSAGE, can efficiently learn continuous representations for nodes and edges. These representations also capture product feature information such as price, brand, or engineering attributes. They are combined with a classification model for predicting the existence of the relationship between products. Using a case study of the Chinese car market, we find that our method yields double the prediction performance compared to an Exponential Random Graph Model-based method for predicting the co-consideration relationship between cars. While a vanilla GraphSAGE requires a partial network to make predictions, we introduce an `adjacency prediction model' to circumvent this limitation. This enables us to predict product relationships when no neighborhood information is known. Finally, we demonstrate how a permutation-based interpretability analysis can provide insights on how design attributes impact the predictions of relationships between products. This work provides a systematic method to predict the relationships between products in many different markets.",0
"In recent years, product relationship prediction has gained significant attention from researchers due to its potential applications in recommendation systems, market analysis, and customer segmentation. Traditional methods used for product relationship prediction rely on manually engineered features that often fail to capture complex relationships among products.

"Customers of machine learning systems demand accountability from the companies employing these algorithms for various prediction tasks. Accountability requires understanding of system limit and condition of erroneous predictions, as customers are often interested in understanding the incorrect predictions, and model developers are absorbed in finding methods that can be used to get incremental improvements to an existing system. Therefore, we propose an accountable error characterization method, AEC, to understand when and where errors occur within the existing black-box models. AEC, as constructed with human-understandable linguistic features, allows the model developers to automatically identify the main sources of errors for a given classification system. It can also be used to sample for the set of most informative input points for a next round of training. We perform error detection for a sentiment analysis task using AEC as a case study. Our results on the sample sentiment task show that AEC is able to characterize erroneous predictions into human understandable categories and also achieves promising results on selecting erroneous samples when compared with the uncertainty-based sampling.",0

"Recent advancement of research in biometrics, computer vision, and natural language processing has discovered opportunities for person retrieval from surveillance videos using textual query. The prime objective of a surveillance system is to locate a person using a description, e.g., a short woman with a pink t-shirt and white skirt carrying a black purse. She has brown hair. Such a description contains attributes like gender, height, type of clothing, colour of clothing, hair colour, and accessories. Such attributes are formally known as soft biometrics. They help bridge the semantic gap between a human description and a machine as a textual query contains the person's soft biometric attributes. It is also not feasible to manually search through huge volumes of surveillance footage to retrieve a specific person.

Each approach has been tested in various settings such as crowded places, airports, and public transportation centers demonstrating high retrieval performance and robustness under diverse lighting conditions, occlusions, background clutter, etc. While these methods show great potential, they still face challenges related to dealing with noisy texts, addressing privacy concerns, adapting to dynamic environments, handling new types of data like video sequences or multimodal streams, and ensuring explainability of results, among others. As future research directions, we recommend exploring advanced analytics combining multiple sources of evidence, incorporating domain knowledge or contextual constraints into retrieval pipelines, improving interpretability through attention mechanisms or counterfactual reasoning, enhancing security via tamper detection and authenticity validation, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations across fields involved in intelligent surveillance systems design, deployment, ethical consideration, social impact assessment, etc. Overall, our literature review illustrates both tremendous progress made in person retrieval from textual cues and opportunities f",1
"Image captioning is one of the most challenging tasks in AI, which aims to automatically generate textual sentences for an image. Recent methods for image captioning follow encoder-decoder framework that transforms the sequence of salient regions in an image into natural language descriptions. However, these models usually lack the comprehensive understanding of the contextual interactions reflected on various visual relationships between objects. In this paper, we explore explicit and implicit visual relationships to enrich region-level representations for image captioning. Explicitly, we build semantic graph over object pairs and exploit gated graph convolutional networks (Gated GCN) to selectively aggregate local neighbors' information. Implicitly, we draw global interactions among the detected objects through region-based bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (Region BERT) without extra relational annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO benchmark and achieve remarkable improvements compared with strong baselines.",0
"In recent years, computer vision has made significant progress towards solving problems that were previously considered difficult. One particular task is image caption generation, which involves generating descriptive text summaries of images. To achieve this goal, researchers have proposed several approaches, such as using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, these methods still face challenges in understanding relationships within images, particularly implicit relationships. This study seeks to address this challenge by exploring explicit and implicit visual relationships in image captioning. We propose a new method called Heterogeneous Attention Networks (HetNet), which utilizes both explicit relationships represented through spatial coordinates and object detectors, and implicit relationships inferred from scene context. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two popular datasets - MSCOCO and Flickr8k. Additionally, we conduct an analysis on the effectiveness of different attention mechanisms in capturing visual relationships in image captioning tasks. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating both explicit and implicit relationships into image captioning models for improved performance.",1
"In most real-world applications, it is seldom the case that a given observable evolves independently of its environment. In social networks, users' behavior results from the people they interact with, news in their feed, or trending topics. In natural language, the meaning of phrases emerges from the combination of words. In general medicine, a diagnosis is established on the basis of the interaction of symptoms. Here, we propose a new model, the Interactive Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model (IMMSBM), which investigates the role of interactions between entities (hashtags, words, memes, etc.) and quantifies their importance within the aforementioned corpora. We find that interactions play an important role in those corpora. In inference tasks, taking them into account leads to average relative changes with respect to non-interactive models of up to 150\% in the probability of an outcome. Furthermore, their role greatly improves the predictive power of the model. Our findings suggest that neglecting interactions when modeling real-world phenomena might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn.",0
"This paper presents a framework that uses the stochastic block model to analyze interactions across different groups of nodes (e.g., individuals) within complex networks. We first derive analytical expressions for the joint probability distribution over network statistics, including both connectivity and node attributes. Next, we show how these results can be used to fit maximum likelihood estimates of group affiliations, edge probabilities, attribute effects, and other key parameters associated with multi-layered SBMs. Our findings suggest several new insights into data on social interactions and knowledge diffusion, including evidence of assortative mixing patterns and nonlinearities in tie formation rates across diverse types of actors. In addition, our work extends prior research by accounting for variations among edges, such as homophily along multiple dimensions or external influences like common interests or structural roles. Finally, our numerical simulations demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the proposed approach, which has important implications for understanding how to measure and predict interconnectedness based on large datasets from digital platforms, surveys, or other sources. Overall, the study contributes novel methodological tools for studying heterogeneous network structures and their consequences, expanding opportunities for researchers in fields ranging from sociology to computer science and economics.",1
"In recent years, sentiment analysis and emotion classification are two of the most abundantly used techniques in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Although sentiment analysis and emotion classification are used commonly in applications such as analyzing customer reviews, the popularity of candidates contesting in elections, and comments about various sporting events; however, in this study, we have examined their application for epidemic outbreak detection. Early outbreak detection is the key to deal with epidemics effectively, however, the traditional ways of outbreak detection are time-consuming which inhibits prompt response from the respective departments. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. allow the users to express their thoughts related to different aspects of life, and therefore, serve as a substantial source of information in such situations. The proposed study exploits the bilingual (Urdu and English) data from Twitter and NEWS websites related to the dengue epidemic in Pakistan, and sentiment analysis and emotion classification are performed to acquire deep insights from the data set for gaining a fair idea related to an epidemic outbreak. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used to train and implement the models for the execution of both tasks. The comparative performance of each model has been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-measure.",0
"In recent years, social media platforms have become popular sources of information during public health crises such as epidemics. However, these platforms often contain vast amounts of unstructured text data that need to be analyzed to identify trends and sentiments related to health issues. This study presents a methodology for sentiment and emotion classification of bilingual English/Spanish tweets related to COVID-19. We use deep learning techniques including transfer learning and fine-tuning pretrained models to classify emotions into six categories: negative, positive, neutral, fear, sadness, and joy. Our approach shows high accuracy (76%) on Spanish datasets, which represents one of the most linguistically diverse regions impacted by COVID-19. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning methods to analyze multilingual social media content and provide insights into community emotional response during global pandemics. Furthermore, our work highlights the importance of cross-linguistic research in understanding how people communicate their experiences across different languages during crisis events.",1
"Visual question answering (VQA) is a task that combines both the techniques of computer vision and natural language processing. It requires models to answer a text-based question according to the information contained in a visual. In recent years, the research field of VQA has been expanded.

"There has been recently a growing interest in studying adversarial examples on natural language models in the black-box setting. These methods attack natural language classifiers by perturbing certain important words until the classifier label is changed. In order to find these important words, these methods rank all words by importance by querying the target model word by word for each input sentence, resulting in high query inefficiency. A new interesting approach was introduced that addresses this problem through interpretable learning to learn the word ranking instead of previous expensive search. The main advantage of using this approach is that it achieves comparable attack rates to the state-of-the-art methods, yet faster and with fewer queries, where fewer queries are desirable to avoid suspicion towards the attacking agent. Nonetheless, this approach sacrificed the useful information that could be leveraged from the target classifier for that sake of query efficiency. In this paper we study the effect of leveraging the target model outputs and data on both attack rates and average number of queries, and we show that both can be improved, with a limited overhead of additional queries.",0
"This paper presents a new method of generating text adversarial attacks that utilizes target information to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. By incorporating knowledge of the target model's parameters and architecture into the attack process, we demonstrate a significant increase in success rate while reducing computational costs compared to traditional methods. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and models showing consistent improvements across different tasks and architectures. Our results indicate that leveraging target information can greatly enhance the power of text adversarial attacks as well as provide insights into how these attacks work. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering both offensive and defensive aspects of machine learning systems. The ability of deep neural networks (DNN) to generalize has been studied intensively over recent years. However, less attention has been paid to analyze why DNNs fail during training, even though such analysis would have profound theoretical implications and allow one to better optimize the training procedure. In previous researches, some works propose to add noise during the forward pass in order to regularize the weights in the network so that each unit contributes approximately equally to the final output. Those works showed improvement in the robustness of the learned models against small perturbations but did not investigate their relationship to the problem of vanishing gradients which appears early on in training. Based on this observation, in this work, we aim at studying the connection between gradient obfuscation and generalization. For example, whether adding noise or increasing batch size could prevent vanishing gradients? And if yes, under which conditions? What kind of noise/batchsize combination leads to optimal performance? Moreover, since a deeper understanding of gradient flowing dynamics might lead us to develop more effective optimization algorithms that converge faster than SGD, thus allowing us to train larger and more powerful models without encountering the limitations brought by computation budget.",1
"Person search has drawn increasing attention due to its real-world applications and research significance. Person search aims to find a probe person in a gallery of scene images with a wide range of applications, such as criminals search, multicamera tracking, missing person search, etc. Early person search works focused on image-based person search, which uses person image as the search query. Text-based person search is another major person search category that uses free-form natural language as the search query. Person search is challenging, and corresponding solutions are diverse and complex. Therefore, systematic surveys on this topic are essential. This paper surveyed the recent works on image-based and text-based person search from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide a brief analysis of highly influential person search methods considering the three significant challenges: the discriminative person features, the query-person gap, and the detection-identification inconsistency. We summarise and compare evaluation results. Finally, we discuss open issues and some promising future research directions.",0
"This paper presents a comprehensive survey on person search challenges and solutions, exploring both traditional methods and recent advances in technology. We focus on various aspects related to person search, including image and video analysis, natural language processing (NLP), social media, and crowdsourcing. Our aim is to provide researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with a clear understanding of current techniques used in person search operations, as well as identify future directions for research in this domain. Through our extensive review process, we uncover many promising approaches that could improve person search processes, such as deep learning algorithms and machine learning models that can accurately detect individuals in large collections of images and videos. We discuss the benefits and limitations of these technologies and highlight their potential contributions toward solving some of today’s most pressing person search problems. Our findings suggest there is significant room for improvement in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, particularly given the rapid growth of online data sources, which means the landscape may shift rapidly in the coming years. Overall, this work contributes to enhancing public safety and security efforts by providing insights into person search strategies and tools available today, along with opportunities for further advancements.",1
"As one of the most fundamental tasks in graph theory, subgraph matching is a crucial task in many fields, ranging from information retrieval, computer vision, biology, chemistry and natural language processing. Yet subgraph matching problem remains to be an NP-complete problem. This study proposes an end-to-end learning-based approximate method for subgraph matching task, called subgraph matching network (Sub-GMN). The proposed Sub-GMN firstly uses graph representation learning to map nodes to node-level embedding. It then combines metric learning and attention mechanisms to model the relationship between matched nodes in the data graph and query graph. To test the performance of the proposed method, we applied our method on two databases. We used two existing methods, GNN and FGNN as baseline for comparison. Our experiment shows that, on dataset 1, on average the accuracy of Sub-GMN are 12.21\% and 3.2\% higher than that of GNN and FGNN respectively. On average running time Sub-GMN runs 20-40 times faster than FGNN. In addition, the average F1-score of Sub-GMN on all experiments with dataset 2 reached 0.95, which demonstrates that Sub-GMN outputs more correct node-to-node matches.   Comparing with the previous GNNs-based methods for subgraph matching task, our proposed Sub-GMN allows varying query and data graphes in the test/application stage, while most previous GNNs-based methods can only find a matched subgraph in the data graph during the test/application for the same query graph used in the training stage. Another advantage of our proposed Sub-GMN is that it can output a list of node-to-node matches, while most existing end-to-end GNNs based methods cannot provide the matched node pairs.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise as powerful models for understanding complex data structures such as graphs and networks. However, despite their successes, there remain many challenges facing GNNs in terms of scalability, computational complexity, and model expressiveness. To address these limitations, we present a new graph convolutional network architecture called ""Sub-GMN"", which stands for Subgraph Matching Network.  Our proposed approach leverages several key insights from traditional computer vision techniques and applies them to subgraph matching problems using a GCN design. Specifically, our model first identifies anchor patches across both input graphs based on low-level features like edge lengths and node degrees. Then, it performs local feature aggregation within each anchor patch using self-attention modules before computing global features that encode structural similarity relationships between the two input graphs. Finally, we apply a fully connected layer with Sigmoid activation function over the output nodes of last FC layer for generating probability scores over all the labeled binary substructures.  Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness even at very high levels of sparsity where most existing methods struggle. Our work represents another step forward towards making GNNs more flexible and powerful tools for solving real-world graph mining problems while maintaining high interpretability and explainability guarantees.  -----  The performance and applicability of graph neural networks (GNNs) continue to grow rapidly, but they still face some formidable challenges in terms of scale, complexity, and expressive power. We propose a novel graph convolutional network architecture called “Sub-GMN” to address these limitations and improve upon current approaches to graph mining. Based o",1
"Remarkable performance from Transformer networks in Natural Language Processing promote the development of these models in dealing with computer vision tasks such as image recognition and segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called Multi-level Multi-scale Point Transformer (MLMSPT) that works directly on the irregular point clouds for representation learning. Specifically, a point pyramid transformer is investigated to model features with diverse resolutions or scales we defined, followed by a multi-level transformer module to aggregate contextual information from different levels of each scale and enhance their interactions. While a multi-scale transformer module is designed to capture the dependencies among representations across different scales. Extensive evaluation on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the competitive performance of our methods on 3D shape classification, part segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks.",0
"Advance image generation techniques have enabled computer vision researchers to generate high resolution 2D images from 3D point clouds. These generative models often rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which tend to capture local features and lack the ability to model interdependencies among different parts of a scene. In contrast, transformer architectures process input sequences as a whole and can effectively capture global dependencies and relationships. This makes them ideal candidates for learning spatial relations from large datasets such as LiDAR scans which comprise millions of points representing real world environments at fine scales. The goal of our work is to propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of both CNNs and transformers by leveraging a hybrid architecture that enables end-to-end training of high quality 2D maps directly from raw 3D lidar data. We validate our method using qualitative and quantitative evaluations including cross validation against ground truth maps and user studies where we measure perceived visual fidelity of generated 2D maps over state-of-the-art methods. Our results show significant improvements across all metrics indicating the effectiveness of our approach in generating accurate 2D maps from high definition 3D point cloud data. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing intelligent systems capable of processing massive amounts of sensor data collected in complex urban scenarios and producing interpretable representations required for decision making tasks.",1

We show how to distinguish between Genuine and Spam accounts in Twitter using a combination of Graph Representation Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques.",0
"In this research work, we study the problem of detecting fake users on social media platforms (SMPs) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and graph embeddings. With the rise of deepfakes and automated bots on online spaces, identifying authentic user behavior has become increasingly difficult. In our approach, we propose a multi-modal framework that utilizes both textual cues and network features to model user behavior and identify anomalous activities. Specifically, we analyze three types of data: text posts, images, and interactions within a user’s social network. We then use graph embedding methods to encode these features into fixed-length vectors which capture both local and global structure in the graph. Finally, we train machine learning models such as XGBoost and Random Forest to distinguish real from fake profiles with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets. Our findings have implications for various applications ranging from cybersecurity to digital marketing, emphasizing the importance of developing effective solutions to mitigate the impact of deepfakes and malicious actors on online communities. Overall, our proposed methodology provides an important step towards building secure and trustworthy online environments by addressing the pressing issue of identifying fake users in large-scale networks.",1
"Self-attention mechanism recently achieves impressive advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Processing domains. And its permutation invariance property makes it ideally suitable for point cloud processing. Inspired by this remarkable success, we propose an end-to-end architecture, dubbed Cross-Level Cross-Scale Cross-Attention Network (CLCSCANet), for point cloud representation learning. First, a point-wise feature pyramid module is introduced to hierarchically extract features from different scales or resolutions. Then a cross-level cross-attention is designed to model long-range inter-level and intra-level dependencies. Finally, we develop a cross-scale cross-attention module to capture interactions between-and-within scales for representation enhancement. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our network can obtain competitive performance on challenging 3D object classification, point cloud segmentation tasks via comprehensive experimental evaluation.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen rapid advances over the past decade due to the development of novel architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), etc. These architectures have been designed based on the notion that data can exhibit complex patterns across different scales and levels. This implies that learning effective representations from raw data often requires models capable of capturing these complex relationships. In recent years, deep point cloud representation has become increasingly important thanks largely to advancements in LiDAR technology which enables acquisition of high-resolution point clouds at low cost and time. The most commonly used methods for feature extraction from LiDAR points rely heavily on handcrafted features like Harris corners, SIFT descriptors, and spin images. While these techniques work well, they tend to lack generalization capabilities because they require engineered features specific to each application domain. Recent works try to replace these handengineered features with learnable ones but suffer from two major issues: either limited capacity of individual network components or suboptimal aggregation of local features. To address these limitations, we introduce the Cross-Level Cross-Scale Cross Attention Network(CCSN) architecture to jointly model interrelationships among multiple levels of abstraction and their corresponding scales. CCSN consists of three main parts: the encoder module, the cross-level attention module, and the decoder module. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI dataset in terms of accuracy metrics and inference speed compared against other methods.

"Following the tremendous success of transformer in natural language processing and image understanding tasks, in this paper, we present a novel point cloud representation learning architecture, named Dual Transformer Network (DTNet), which mainly consists of Dual Point Cloud Transformer (DPCT) module. Specifically, by aggregating the well-designed point-wise and channel-wise multi-head self-attention models simultaneously, DPCT module can capture much richer contextual dependencies semantically from the perspective of position and channel. With the DPCT module as a fundamental component, we construct the DTNet for performing point cloud analysis in an end-to-end manner. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed transformer framework for the tasks of 3D point cloud classification and segmentation, achieving highly competitive performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This paper proposes a novel dual transformer network architecture for point cloud analysis tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Our approach uses two parallel encoders based on multi-head self attention mechanisms to capture global and local context respectively. These encoded representations are then fused to obtain a more comprehensive feature representation that can better encode high-level scene understanding and detailed geometry information. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming prior arts by significant margins. We further analyze our method qualitatively and quantitatively, showing improved accuracy and robustness especially near object boundaries where most methods suffer from loss of detail. Overall, we show that our dual transformer framework provides powerful generalization abilities through strong inductive biases introduced via effective fusion mechanisms.",1
"Deep learning has yielded extraordinary results in vision and natural language processing, but this achievement comes at a cost. Most deep learning models require enormous resources during training, both in terms of computation and in human labeling effort. In this paper, we show that one can achieve similar accuracy to traditional deep-learning models, while using less training data. Much of the previous work in this area relies on using uncertainty or some form of diversity to select subsets of a larger training set. Submodularity, a discrete analogue of convexity, has been exploited to model diversity in various settings including data subset selection. In contrast to prior methods, we propose a novel diversity driven objective function, and balancing constraints on class labels and decision boundaries using matroids. This allows us to use efficient greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees for subset selection. We outperform baselines on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In addition, we also show that the proposed balancing constraints can play a key role in boosting the performance in long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT.",0
"In many real-world applications, selecting a subset of data can improve performance while reducing computational costs. However, finding the optimal subset that balances constraints and maximizes utility is challenging. This paper presents a new framework that combines submodularity and constraint handling to efficiently select high-quality subsets. We provide theoretical guarantees on both the quality of our solution and the running time of our algorithm. Our extensive experimental evaluation across diverse domains demonstrates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins, often returning solutions of higher quality within tight time limits. Overall, we believe that our work has broad impact and could enable efficient and effective subset selection in numerous application areas.",1
"In many real-world scenarios where extrinsic rewards to the agent are extremely sparse, curiosity has emerged as a useful concept providing intrinsic rewards that enable the agent to explore its environment and acquire information to achieve its goals. Despite their strong performance on many sparse-reward tasks, existing curiosity approaches rely on an overly holistic view of state transitions, and do not allow for a structured understanding of specific aspects of the environment. In this paper, we formulate curiosity based on grounded question answering by encouraging the agent to ask questions about the environment and be curious when the answers to these questions change. We show that natural language questions encourage the agent to uncover specific knowledge about their environment such as the physical properties of objects as well as their spatial relationships with other objects, which serve as valuable curiosity rewards to solve sparse-reward tasks more efficiently.",0
"This paper presents a framework for natural language question answering that enables robots to engage in curiosity-driven exploration and knowledge acquisition. Our approach, called ""Ask & Explore"", involves two key components: (1) active question generation, where the robot generates questions based on its current beliefs and goals, and (2) grounded question answering, where the robot uses perception, reasoning, and external resources to provide accurate answers to these questions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments conducted on both real-world robots and simulated environments, showing that our method can enable robots to achieve significant improvements in their understanding of novel situations and phenomena. Additionally, we compare our approach against state-of-the-art methods in curiosity-driven learning and discuss its advantages in terms of efficiency, scalability, and adaptability to different domains and tasks. Overall, this work contributes to the development of autonomous agents capable of flexible and effective self-directed learning in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments.",1
"Natural language-based vehicle retrieval is a task to find a target vehicle within a given image based on a natural language description as a query. This technology can be applied to various areas including police searching for a suspect vehicle. However, it is challenging due to the ambiguity of language descriptions and the difficulty of processing multi-modal data. To tackle this problem, we propose a deep neural network called SBNet that performs natural language-based segmentation for vehicle retrieval. We also propose two task-specific modules to improve performance: a substitution module that helps features from different domains to be embedded in the same space and a future prediction module that learns temporal information. SBnet has been trained using the CityFlow-NL dataset that contains 2,498 tracks of vehicles with three unique natural language descriptions each and tested 530 unique vehicle tracks and their corresponding query sets. SBNet achieved a significant improvement over the baseline in the natural language-based vehicle tracking track in the AI City Challenge 2021.",0

"Chest radiography is the most common radiographic examination performed in daily clinical practice for the detection of various heart and lung abnormalities. The large amount of data to be read and reported, with more than 100 studies per day for a single radiologist, poses a challenge in consistently maintaining high interpretation accuracy. The introduction of large-scale public datasets has led to a series of novel systems for automated abnormality classification. However, the labels of these datasets were obtained using natural language processed medical reports, yielding a large degree of label noise that can impact the performance. In this study, we propose novel training strategies that handle label noise from such suboptimal data. Prior label probabilities were measured on a subset of training data re-read by 4 board-certified radiologists and were used during training to increase the robustness of the training model to the label noise. Furthermore, we exploit the high comorbidity of abnormalities observed in chest radiography and incorporate this information to further reduce the impact of label noise. Additionally, anatomical knowledge is incorporated by training the system to predict lung and heart segmentation, as well as spatial knowledge labels. To deal with multiple datasets and images derived from various scanners that apply different post-processing techniques, we introduce a novel image normalization strategy. Experiments were performed on an extensive collection of 297,541 chest radiographs from 86,876 patients, leading to a state-of-the-art performance level for 17 abnormalities from 2 datasets. With an average AUC score of 0.880 across all abnormalities, our proposed training strategies can be used to significantly improve performance scores.",0
"This paper presents a new method for improving classification accuracy from noisy labels using additional sources of knowledge.

"Referring expression comprehension aims to localize objects identified by natural language descriptions. This is a challenging task as it requires understanding of both visual and language domains. One nature is that each object can be described by synonymous sentences with paraphrases, and such varieties in languages have critical impact on learning a comprehension model. While prior work usually treats each sentence and attends it to an object separately, we focus on learning a referring expression comprehension model that considers the property in synonymous sentences. To this end, we develop an end-to-end trainable framework to learn contrastive features on the image and object instance levels, where features extracted from synonymous sentences to describe the same object should be closer to each other after mapping to the visual domain. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm on several benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, since the varieties in expressions become larger across datasets when they describe objects in different ways, we present the cross-dataset and transfer learning settings to validate the ability of our learned transferable features.",0
"In natural language understanding, synonymous referring expressions (SREs) play a crucial role in conveying meaning and establishing reference relations. However, automatically distinguishing SREs from non-synonyms remains a challenging task for NLP systems. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages contrastive features to accurately identify SREs based on their subtle differences compared to non-synonyms. Our method extracts multiple types of features including lexical, semantic, and contextual cues, then applies a machine learning model trained on these features to make predictions. We evaluate our approach using four standard benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results across all metrics. Furthermore, we conduct human evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Overall, our work provides insights into how NLP can better handle SREs and improve performance in applications such as text summarization, question answering, and machine translation.",1
"Text-video retrieval is a challenging task that aims to search relevant video contents based on natural language descriptions. The key to this problem is to measure text-video similarities in a joint embedding space. However, most existing methods only consider the global cross-modal similarity and overlook the local details. Some works incorporate the local comparisons through cross-modal local matching and reasoning. These complex operations introduce tremendous computation. In this paper, we design an efficient global-local alignment method. The multi-modal video sequences and text features are adaptively aggregated with a set of shared semantic centers. The local cross-modal similarities are computed between the video feature and text feature within the same center. This design enables the meticulous local comparison and reduces the computational cost of the interaction between each text-video pair. Moreover, a global alignment method is proposed to provide a global cross-modal measurement that is complementary to the local perspective. The global aggregated visual features also provide additional supervision, which is indispensable to the optimization of the learnable semantic centers. We achieve consistent improvements on three standard text-video retrieval benchmarks and outperform the state-of-the-art by a clear margin.",0
"This paper presents T2VLAD, a novel global-local sequence alignment method that enables efficient text-video retrieval by capturing both semantically meaningful features and subtle appearance differences across videos. We first propose a Temporal Pyramid Network (TPN) which encodes video into a multi-scale feature pyramid representation. Then we apply local alignment networks such as Dynamic Routing Networks on top of the pyramid representation to capture fine-grained correspondences between the query text and video segments. To ensure robustness against noisy and irrelevant matchings, we design a probabilistic framework based on Variational Autoencoder for inference and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods significantly on large-scale benchmark datasets while achieving real-time speed. Our work sheds light on effective feature encoding and local sequence alignment for multimedia retrieval tasks.",1
"Motivated by the success of Transformers in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there emerge some attempts (e.g., ViT and DeiT) to apply Transformers to the vision domain. However, pure Transformer architectures often require a large amount of training data or extra supervision to obtain comparable performance with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing Transformer architectures from NLP. Then we propose a new \textbf{Convolution-enhanced image Transformer (CeiT)} which combines the advantages of CNNs in extracting low-level features, strengthening locality, and the advantages of Transformers in establishing long-range dependencies. Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: \textbf{1)} instead of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an \textbf{Image-to-Tokens (I2T)} module that extracts patches from generated low-level features; \textbf{2)} the feed-froward network in each encoder block is replaced with a \textbf{Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF)} layer that promotes the correlation among neighboring tokens in the spatial dimension; \textbf{3)} a \textbf{Layer-wise Class token Attention (LCA)} is attached at the top of the Transformer that utilizes the multi-level representations.   Experimental results on ImageNet and seven downstream tasks show the effectiveness and generalization ability of CeiT compared with previous Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs, without requiring a large amount of training data and extra CNN teachers. Besides, CeiT models also demonstrate better convergence with $3\times$ fewer training iterations, which can reduce the training cost significantly\footnote{Code and models will be released upon acceptance.}.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years due to advances in deep learning technologies such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models. While CNNs have been widely used for image recognition tasks, they suffer from several limitations including poor parallelization, slow convergence, and limited modeling capacity for global dependencies. On the other hand, transformers provide superior parallelism and can effectively capture complex relationships among input elements but lack the ability to explicitly consider spatial hierarchies found in images. To address these challenges, we propose incorporating convolution designs into visual transformers by hybridizing their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses. This approach allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks while improving computational efficiency and robustness against noise and perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both standalone CNNs and transformers on several popular datasets, thus paving the way for future research in this direction. By combining the complementary advantages of CNNs and transformers through judicious design choices, our work represents an important step towards realizing efficient and effective AI systems for computer vision applications.",1
"Traditional computer vision models are trained to predict a fixed set of predefined categories. Recently, natural language has been shown to be a broader and richer source of supervision that provides finer descriptions to visual concepts than supervised ""gold"" labels. Previous works, such as CLIP, use a simple pretraining task of predicting the pairings between images and text captions. CLIP, however, is data hungry and requires more than 400M image text pairs for training. We propose a data-efficient contrastive distillation method that uses soft labels to learn from noisy image-text pairs. Our model transfers knowledge from pretrained image and sentence encoders and achieves strong performance with only 3M image text pairs, 133x smaller than CLIP. Our method exceeds the previous SoTA of general zero-shot learning on ImageNet 21k+1k by 73% relatively with a ResNet50 image encoder and DeCLUTR text encoder. We also beat CLIP by 10.5% relatively on zero-shot evaluation on Google Open Images (19,958 classes).",0
"This paper describes how we can use language supervision to train machine learning models more efficiently by taking advantage of self-distillation. We show that by distilling knowledge from pretrained models and using it as additional supervision, we can achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several natural language understanding tasks. Our approach works well across different model architectures, and requires only a small amount of additional data to produce significant improvements over baseline methods.",1
"Recent advances in using retrieval components over external knowledge sources have shown impressive results for a variety of downstream tasks in natural language processing. Here, we explore the use of unstructured external knowledge sources of images and their corresponding captions for improving visual question answering (VQA). First, we train a novel alignment model for embedding images and captions in the same space, which achieves substantial improvement in performance on image-caption retrieval w.r.t. similar methods. Second, we show that retrieval-augmented multi-modal transformers using the trained alignment model improve results on VQA over strong baselines. We further conduct extensive experiments to establish the promise of this approach, and examine novel applications for inference time such as hot-swapping indices.",0
"In this paper we propose a cross modal retrieval augmentation approach to improve multi-modal classification accuracy. Our method utilizes complementary modalities as auxiliary input data sources to increase the quality and quantity of training samples available to train deep neural networks which achieve better generalization on benchmark datasets such as HAVIC [2] and MUGA-II [7]. We provide extensive analysis using multiple variations of our proposed approach including ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Finally, through experiments we show that our approach outperforms strong baselines such as DenseNet [4], ResNet [9], and VGG Net [6] achieving higher mean average precision (mAP) on these challenging multi-label benchmarks by up to +4%. Additionally, our model size remains small making deployment feasible across platforms where compute power may be limited. This research provides valuable insights into how to optimize deep learning models for real world problems involving complex, uncertain sensory inputs derived from the physical world. This paper proposes a novel approach to improving multi-modal classification accuracy using cross-modal retrieval augmentation. By leveraging complementary modalities as additional input data sources, the proposed method increases both the quality and quantity of training data available to deep neural networks, leading to improved generalization performance on benchmark datasets like HAVIC and MUGA-II. Thorough evaluation has been conducted, including ablation studies, to demonstrate the impact of each individual component of the methodology. Experiments have shown that the proposed approach can significantly surpass established models like DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG Net by as much as 4% mAP while maintaining compact model sizes suitable for resource-constrained environments.

"People's visual experiences of the world are easy to carve up and examine along natural language boundaries, e.g., by category labels, attribute labels, etc. However, it is more difficult to elicit detailed visuospatial information about what a person attends to, e.g., the specific shape of a tree. Paying attention to the shapes of things not only feeds into well defined tasks like visual category learning, but it is also what enables us to differentiate similarly named objects and to take on creative visual pursuits, like poetically describing the shape of a thing, or finding shapes in the clouds or stars. We use a new data collection method that elicits people's prioritized attention to shapes during visual photo inspection by asking them to trace important parts of the image under varying time constraints. Using data collected via crowdsourcing over a set of 187 photographs, we examine changes in patterns of visual attention across individuals, across image types, and across time constraints.",0
"This study investigates how time constraints affect attention to shape during visual photo inspection tasks. We hypothesized that when participants were under time pressure, they would prioritize attending to shapes over other aspects of the images. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments using a visual inspection task where participants had either unlimited time or limited time to complete the task. Results showed that when time was limited, participants attended more to shapes than when time was unlimited. These findings suggest that time constraints can re-prioritize attention to shapes during visual photo inspection tasks. Further research is necessary to explore how different types of time constraints may impact attention to various features of images and how these effects might vary across individuals and situations. Overall, our results contribute to understanding how attention and perception are influenced by time pressures and have implications for designing effective visual displays in real-world settings where time constraints may be present.",1
"Machine learning applications to symbolic mathematics are becoming increasingly popular, yet there lacks a centralized source of real-world symbolic expressions to be used as training data. In contrast, the field of natural language processing leverages resources like Wikipedia that provide enormous amounts of real-world textual data. Adopting the philosophy of ""mathematics as language,"" we bridge this gap by introducing a pipeline for distilling mathematical expressions embedded in Wikipedia into symbolic encodings to be used in downstream machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that a $\textit{mathematical}$ $\textit{language}$ $\textit{model}$ trained on this ""corpus"" of expressions can be used as a prior to improve the performance of neural-guided search for the task of symbolic regression.",0

"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted in the representation learning of graph-structured data and provided state-of-the-art performance in various applications such as link prediction, node classification, and recommendation. Motivated by recent advances of self-supervision for representation learning in natural language processing and computer vision, self-supervised learning has been recently studied to leverage unlabeled graph-structured data. However, employing self-supervision tasks as auxiliary tasks to assist a primary task has been less explored in the literature on graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised auxiliary learning framework to effectively learn graph neural networks. Moreover, this work is the first study showing that a meta-path prediction is beneficial as a self-supervised auxiliary task for heterogeneous graphs. Our method is learning to learn a primary task with various auxiliary tasks to improve generalization performance. The proposed method identifies an effective combination of auxiliary tasks and automatically balances them to improve the primary task. Our methods can be applied to any graph neural network in a plug-in manner without manual labeling or additional data. Also, it can be extended to any other auxiliary tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the performance of node classification and link prediction.",0
"This work introduces self-supervised auxiliary learning for graph neural networks (GNN) via meta-learning. We use meta-learning to optimize over task distributions that generate training tasks on existing data sets, leading to better generalization performance at low computational cost. Our approach uses a single GNN model as opposed to multiple models which have to learn each time from scratch like traditional fine-tuning methods. Additionally, our method can make predictions without additional data annotation costs. For example, we show that compared to supervised baselines, our algorithm achieves higher accuracy. Finally, our results suggest that auxiliary self-supervision can significantly improve standard semi-supervised learning approaches.",1
"The computational prediction algorithm of neural network, or deep learning, has drawn much attention recently in statistics as well as in image recognition and natural language processing. Particularly in statistical application for censored survival data, the loss function used for optimization has been mainly based on the partial likelihood from Cox's model and its variations to utilize existing neural network library such as Keras, which was built upon the open source library of TensorFlow. This paper presents a novel application of the neural network to the quantile regression for survival data with right censoring, which is adjusted by the inverse of the estimated censoring distribution in the check function. The main purpose of this work is to show that the deep learning method could be flexible enough to predict nonlinear patterns more accurately compared to existing quantile regression methods such as traditional linear quantile regression and nonparametric quantile regression with total variation regularization, emphasizing practicality of the method for censored survival data. Simulation studies were performed to generate nonlinear censored survival data and compare the deep learning method with existing quantile regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The proposed method is illustrated with two publicly available breast cancer data sets with gene signatures. The method has been built into a package and is freely available at \url{https://github.com/yicjia/DeepQuantreg}.",0
"This article presents a deep learning method for quantile regression under right censorship. We use a modified version of the popular DenseNet architecture that preserves information on both the input variables and intermediate feature maps, resulting in better performance than traditional machine learning approaches. Our model effectively captures nonlinear relationships between covariates and survival outcomes by utilizing deep neural networks. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved accuracy compared to several benchmark methods across multiple datasets. Overall, this work contributes a new approach for tackling the challenges inherent in survival analysis with censored data.",1
"Compressing large neural networks is an important step for their deployment in resource-constrained computational platforms. In this context, vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code, and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40 to 70% with respect to the current state of the art.",0
"Neural network compression has become increasingly important as we strive to make deep learning models more efficient without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques that address different aspects of the compression problem: permutation, quantization, and fine-tuning. We show how these methods can be combined to achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets across a variety of architectures and tasks. Our contributions include a comprehensive evaluation framework that allows us to compare our approach against other compression algorithms, as well as a thorough analysis of the tradeoffs involved in each step of the process. Overall, we demonstrate that by carefully choosing which layers to compress and which operations to apply at runtime, significant reductions in model size and computational cost can be achieved while maintaining strong predictive performance. These findings have implications for real-world applications where storage constraints, latency requirements, and energy efficiency are critical factors.",1
"A full-fledged data exploration system must combine different access modalities with a powerful concept of guiding the user in the exploration process, by being reactive and anticipative both for data discovery and for data linking. Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE -- an end-to-end data exploration system -- that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Reearch, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",0
"In our paper, we describe how to build an end-to-end data exploration system that provides interactive visualizations on arbitrary datasets in real time. Our approach is based on the idea of using inode queries to identify interesting subspaces within a dataset. We use a combination of database indexing techniques and GPU acceleration to make these queries as fast and efficient as possible. By combining these techniques with traditional machine learning algorithms, we can create a powerful tool for data analysis and discovery. While there have been many previous attempts at building similar systems, none have achieved the level of performance and ease of use that we demonstrate in our work. We believe that our approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of data science by making it easy for anyone to explore complex data sets in real time.",1
"We algorithmically identify label errors in the test sets of 10 of the most commonly-used computer vision, natural language, and audio datasets, and subsequently study the potential for these label errors to affect benchmark results. Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of 3.4% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example 2916 label errors comprise 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are found using confident learning and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (54% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled). Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6%. On CIFAR-10 with corrected labels: VGG-11 outperforms VGG-19 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by 5%. Traditionally, ML practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy -- our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets.",0
"""Pervasive label errors"" refers to the fact that machine learning models often have very high accuracy on their test sets--high enough to make them look impressively good at a given task. However, these test sets aren't always representative of real data distributions (e.g., because they were sampled from different populations), which can cause discrepancies between model performance and actual utility. In some cases, these discrepancies lead to substantial ""bias variance dilemma,"" whereby machine learning practitioners must balance underfitting/overfitting against model misspecification. This paper argues that researchers need better ways to identify and correct pervasive label errors in benchmark datasets to ensure more accurate evaluation and reproducibility across applications. Through case studies involving established benchmarks, we demonstrate how simple cleaning techniques can sometimes mitigate these errors and significantly improve model calibration/generalization performance. We discuss several open challenges involved in detecting/addressing label noise in large-scale, complex domains while maintaining scalability and usability. Overall, our study underscores the importance of addressing pervasive label errors to achieve reliable progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence.",1
"Self-supervised learning methods are gaining increasing traction in computer vision due to their recent success in reducing the gap with supervised learning. In natural language processing (NLP) self-supervised learning and transformers are already the methods of choice. The recent literature suggests that the transformers are becoming increasingly popular also in computer vision. So far, the vision transformers have been shown to work well when pretrained either using a large scale supervised data or with some kind of co-supervision, e.g. in terms of teacher network. These supervised pretrained vision transformers achieve very good results in downstream tasks with minimal changes. In this work we investigate the merits of self-supervised learning for pretraining image/vision transformers and then using them for downstream classification tasks. We propose Self-supervised vIsion Transformers (SiT) and discuss several self-supervised training mechanisms to obtain a pretext model. The architectural flexibility of SiT allows us to use it as an autoencoder and work with multiple self-supervised tasks seamlessly. We show that a pretrained SiT can be finetuned for a downstream classification task on small scale datasets, consisting of a few thousand images rather than several millions. The proposed approach is evaluated on standard datasets using common protocols. The results demonstrate the strength of the transformers and their suitability for self-supervised learning. We outperformed existing self-supervised learning methods by large margin. We also observed that SiT is good for few shot learning and also showed that it is learning useful representation by simply training a linear classifier on top of the learned features from SiT. Pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation codes will be available under: https://github.com/Sara-Ahmed/SiT.",0
"Vision transformers have revolutionized computer vision by achieving top results on several benchmarks without using manual feature engineering, yet their success relies heavily on large amounts of labeled data and pretext tasks that may limit transferability to downstream objectives. In our work we introduce a simple self supervised approach (SiT) that trains a pure-transformer on jigsaw puzzles obtained from public datasets, significantly outperforming previous methods under weakly supervised settings, while being more generic, efficient and simpler than prior works. We further showcase SiT’s strong performance can boost the quality of linear probing and semi-supervised fine-tuning on challenging domains like semantic segmentation on plant cells where only very few annotations are available. Our findings pave the way towards fully unsupervised visual representation learning that generalizes across different domains.",1
"We study joint learning of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer for vision-language pre-training (VLPT) which aims to learn cross-modal alignments from millions of image-text pairs. State-of-the-art approaches extract salient image regions and align regions with words step-by-step. As region-based visual features usually represent parts of an image, it is challenging for existing vision-language models to fully understand the semantics from paired natural languages. In this paper, we propose SOHO to ""See Out of tHe bOx"" that takes a whole image as input, and learns vision-language representation in an end-to-end manner. SOHO does not require bounding box annotations which enables inference 10 times faster than region-based approaches. In particular, SOHO learns to extract comprehensive yet compact image features through a visual dictionary (VD) that facilitates cross-modal understanding. VD is designed to represent consistent visual abstractions of similar semantics. It is updated on-the-fly and utilized in our proposed pre-training task Masked Visual Modeling (MVM). We conduct experiments on four well-established vision-language tasks by following standard VLPT settings. In particular, SOHO achieves absolute gains of 2.0% R@1 score on MSCOCO text retrieval 5k test split, 1.5% accuracy on NLVR$^2$ test-P split, 6.7% accuracy on SNLI-VE test split, respectively.",0
"This is an abstract on the paper ""Seeing out of the box"". In the research community, there has been significant interest recently in learning transferable representations that perform well across multiple NLP tasks without task-specific fine tuning. Although vision-language pretraining using multi-modal models has shown promise, previous methods have only used textual supervision and limited amounts of image data. This paper presents end-to-end pretraining for vision-language representation learning by jointly training the model on large amounts of both image and language data. Experiments show significantly better results compared to prior art and demonstrate that these learned representations generalize effectively to downstream NLP tasks. Overall, this work takes an important step towards more capable general-purpose intelligent systems.",1
"Over the last decade, the use of Deep Learning in many applications produced results that are comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. The application domains include diagnosing diseases, finance, agriculture, search engines, robot vision, and many others. In this paper, we are proposing an architecture that utilizes image/video captioning methods and Natural Language Processing systems to generate a title and a concise abstract for a video. Such a system can potentially be utilized in many application domains, including, the cinema industry, video search engines, security surveillance, video databases/warehouses, data centers, and others. The proposed system functions and operates as followed: it reads a video; representative image frames are identified and selected; the image frames are captioned; NLP is applied to all generated captions together with text summarization; and finally, a title and an abstract are generated for the video. All functions are performed automatically. Preliminary results are provided in this paper using publicly available datasets. This paper is not concerned about the efficiency of the system at the execution time. We hope to be able to address execution efficiency issues in our subsequent publications.",0
"In this paper we present a system which automatically generates descriptive titles for video clips using deep learning techniques. We use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have been trained on large amounts of image data to extract features from each frame in the clip. These features are then used as input for a recurrent neural network (RNN), which generates a sequence of tokens representing candidate titles. Finally, these tokens are combined into a single string using a beam search algorithm, resulting in a natural language description of the content depicted in the video clip. To evaluate our method we performed experiments comparing automatic and manual generation of titels using a dataset of over one thousand YouTube videos. Results showed that out system was able to accurately capture important aspects of the video content such as objects, actions, and scene categories while producing descriptive titles which were comparable to those generated by human annotators. Furthermore we show how our system can be applied to real world applications such as content retrieval, where automatic generation of descriptive titles could greatly improve accessibility for visually impaired users. This research demonstrates how recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning can be applied to generate natural language descriptions of visual media such as videos, addressing one of the major challenges in multimedia retrieval and accessibility. Our work represents an important step towards developing more advanced AI systems capable of generating rich semantic representations of complex sensory inputs.

"Object detection with transformers (DETR) reaches competitive performance with Faster R-CNN via a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Inspired by the great success of pre-training transformers in natural language processing, we propose a pretext task named random query patch detection to Unsupervisedly Pre-train DETR (UP-DETR) for object detection. Specifically, we randomly crop patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the original image. During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning and multi-query localization. (1) To trade off classification and localization preferences in the pretext task, we freeze the CNN backbone and propose a patch feature reconstruction branch which is jointly optimized with patch detection. (2) To perform multi-query localization, we introduce UP-DETR from single-query patch and extend it to multi-query patches with object query shuffle and attention mask. In our experiments, UP-DETR significantly boosts the performance of DETR with faster convergence and higher average precision on object detection, one-shot detection and panoptic segmentation.

"While deep learning is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP) problems, successful solutions to these problems rely heavily on large amounts of annotated samples. However, manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) strategies reduce the need for huge volumes of labeled data by iteratively selecting a small number of examples for manual annotation based on their estimated utility in training the given model. In this paper, we argue that since AL strategies choose examples independently, they may potentially select similar examples, all of which may not contribute significantly to the learning process. Our proposed approach, Active$\mathbf{^2}$ Learning (A$\mathbf{^2}$L), actively adapts to the deep learning model being trained to eliminate such redundant examples chosen by an AL strategy. We show that A$\mathbf{^2}$L is widely applicable by using it in conjunction with several different AL strategies and NLP tasks. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is further able to reduce the data requirements of state-of-the-art AL strategies by $\approx \mathbf{3-25\%}$ on an absolute scale on multiple NLP tasks while achieving the same performance with virtually no additional computation overhead.",0
"Redundancy refers to redundant annotations which have been annotated but contribute no new information - as they can be inferred from other information present in the data (either from previous examples of such things in general or more specifically). In Active learning one usually has at least two types of samples available: positive ones that should be labelled and negative ones that needn’t be. Positive samples may often contain many overlapping parts (redundancies) making labelling them less efficient than it could be. This work presents a method named Active$^2$ that actively reduces these redundencies using simple heuristics. After implementing it we noticed very interesting improvements in accuracy on multiple data sets across both sequence tagging and machine translation domains. Active learning is a popular technique used in natural language processing tasks such as sequence tagging and machine translation to improve model performance by actively selecting informative training instances. However, traditional active learning approaches suffer from redundancies in the selected data, leading to wasted annotation efforts and slow progress in model improvement. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Active$^2$, which uses simple heuristics to reduce redundancies before selecting active instances. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy across several benchmark datasets in both sequence tagging and machine translation domains, compared to baseline active learning methods without reduction. We show that our proposed approach effectively leads to more efficient use of human annotations and faster convergence rates, thereby promoting cost efficiency in real-world applications. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of redundancy reduction in active learning to achieve better model performance.",1
"COVID-19 pandemic has an unprecedented impact all over the world since early 2020. During this public health crisis, reliable forecasting of the disease becomes critical for resource allocation and administrative planning. The results from compartmental models such as SIR and SEIR are popularly referred by CDC and news media. With more and more COVID-19 data becoming available, we examine the following question: Can a direct data-driven approach without modeling the disease spreading dynamics outperform the well referred compartmental models and their variants? In this paper, we show the possibility. It is observed that as COVID-19 spreads at different speed and scale in different geographic regions, it is highly likely that similar progression patterns are shared among these regions within different time periods. This intuition lead us to develop a new neural forecasting model, called Attention Crossing Time Series (\textbf{ACTS}), that makes forecasts via comparing patterns across time series obtained from multiple regions. The attention mechanism originally developed for natural language processing can be leveraged and generalized to materialize this idea. Among 13 out of 18 testings including forecasting newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, \textbf{ACTS} outperforms all the leading COVID-19 forecasters highlighted by CDC.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most promising tools for forecasting the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. In particular, attention mechanisms have been shown to improve the accuracy of models by allowing them to focus on relevant features of the data. However, traditional attention mechanisms operate solely within a single time step or across multiple time steps but without considering interdependencies across different regions at the same time step. In this work, we present a novel model called Inter-Series Attention Network (ISAN), which can capture both intra-series dependencies within each region and interdependencies among different regions simultaneously. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and demonstrates significant improvement over several metrics including mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and correlation coefficient. This paper contributes to the growing literature on machine learning applications for predicting infectious disease epidemics. Future directions could explore incorporating other external variables like economic indicators, weather patterns, or social media data into ISAN to further enhance its performance. Overall, ISAN provides a valuable tool for public health officials responsible for making informed decisions related to containment measures, allocation of resources, and overall management of pandemics.",1

The carefully designed architecture of the Siamese Natural Language Region Proposal Network (SNL-RPN), together with the Dynamic Aggregation of vision and language modalities, is introduced to perform the tracking by NL task. Empirical results over tracking benchmarks with NL annotations show that the proposed SNLT improves Siamese trackers by 3 to 7 percentage points with a slight tradeoff of speed.

Systems that could follow natural language instructions to perform automatic editing would significantly improve accessibility. This paper introduces the language-based video editing (LBVE) task, which allows the model to edit, guided by text instruction, a source video into a target video. LBVE contains two features: 1) the scenario of the source video is preserved instead of generating a completely different video; 2) the semantic is presented differently in the target video, and all changes are controlled by the given instruction. We propose a Multi-Modal Multi-Level Transformer (M$^3$L-Transformer) to carry out LBVE. The M$^3$L-Transformer dynamically learns the correspondence between video perception and language semantic at different levels, which benefits both the video understanding and video frame synthesis. We build three new datasets for evaluation, including two diagnostic and one from natural videos with human-labeled text. Extensive experimental results show that M$^3$L-Transformer is effective for video editing and that LBVE can lead to a new field toward vision-and-language research.",0
"""Language-Based"" vs ""Data Driven"". What are the main differences? Is one better than another? This sounds like a very broad question, but I am interested in learning more about the key aspects that differentiate these two approaches for video editing, so please elaborate as necessary. Can you explain how each approach might be used depending on the application (e.g., consumer use case vs professional use case)? Are there any other key features/elements of the language-based versus data driven approach that would impact their respective applications beyond just video editing? Thank you!",1
"Most of state of the art methods applied on time series consist of deep learning methods that are too complex to be interpreted. This lack of interpretability is a major drawback, as several applications in the real world are critical tasks, such as the medical field or the autonomous driving field. The explainability of models applied on time series has not gather much attention compared to the computer vision or the natural language processing fields. In this paper, we present an overview of existing explainable AI (XAI) methods applied on time series and illustrate the type of explanations they produce. We also provide a reflection on the impact of these explanation methods to provide confidence and trust in the AI systems.",0
"This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), specifically as it pertains to time series data. XAI has gained increasing importance due to the rise of machine learning algorithms that can produce complex results without revealing how those results were arrived at. In the context of time series analysis, where these models are used for predictive analytics in areas such as finance, healthcare, and climate science, understanding model decisions becomes even more crucial. The authors review existing research on time series XAI techniques, their limitations and challenges, and future directions towards enhancing transparency and accountability. They highlight promising approaches, including feature attribution methods, visualization tools, interpretable model architectures, and hybrid frameworks combining multiple XAI methods. Ultimately, they emphasize the need for further study into real-world applications, evaluation metrics, and ethical considerations. This work serves as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in advancing the field of XAI on time series data.",1
"The Transformer architecture has become increasingly popular over the past two years, owing to its impressive performance on a number of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, all Transformer computations occur at the level of word representations and therefore, it may be argued that Transformer models do not explicitly attempt to learn hierarchical structure which is widely assumed to be integral to language. In the present work, we introduce hierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the U-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of natural images. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms both the vanilla Transformer and some strong baselines in the domain of chit-chat dialogue.",0
"Artificial intelligence agents that must make decisions in realtime need some understanding of time in order to operate effectively. In recent years we have seen deep learning models like transformers provide state-of-the-art performance on problems across many domains. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were previously used for most temporal data because they model memory explicitly, but now transformer-based systems can rival these results. But RNNs allow us to easily condition on past observations in a hierarchical manner using attention mechanisms; while some attention architectures can accomplish similar things with sequential inputs processed one at a time, they still lack strong explicit support for hierarchy and often require external supervision signals even if there are clear dependencies in the data itself. We propose injecting hierarchy into transformer architectures by extending them in two ways: First, we modify self-attention heads so each can attend only to specific levels of representation abstraction in other parts of the model rather than attending to all previous context equally. Secondly, we create a novel recurrence mechanism where internal representations propagate via a new type of update gate that modulates the strength of the signal flowing through different components in response to current conditions. Combinations of these modifications allow us to outperform prior methods on three tasks (prediction, zero-shot prompting, and multi-task finetuning), achieving state-of-the-art results without requiring task-specific modules or additional sources of supervisory signals beyond raw input text.",1
"A special purpose learning system assumes knowledge of admissible tasks at design time. Adapting such a system to unforeseen tasks requires architecture manipulation such as adding an output head for each new task or dataset. In this work, we propose a task-agnostic vision-language system that accepts an image and a natural language task description and outputs bounding boxes, confidences, and text. The system supports a wide range of vision tasks such as classification, localization, question answering, captioning, and more. We evaluate the system's ability to learn multiple skills simultaneously, to perform tasks with novel skill-concept combinations, and to learn new skills efficiently and without forgetting.",0
"Abstract: We describe a general framework towards building vision systems that can tackle any task given just pixels as input. Our proposed approach leverages recent advances in computer vision such as semi supervised learning techniques, self attention mechanisms, meta learning approaches etc to improve performance across different benchmarks. Our experiments show significant improvement over baselines on several datasets. In summary we believe our research takes steps towards realizing general purpose vision systems which could open up applications in areas like robotics, agriculture, medicine etc where automation currently faces limitations due to lack of accurate perception systems capable of handling diverse scenarios.",1
"We present DietNeRF, a 3D neural scene representation estimated from a few images. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for challenging 360{\deg} scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different, random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with as few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, and produces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.",0
"Artificial neural networks, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), have achieved state-of-the-art performance across several computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Recently, there has been growing interest in exploiting DCNNs beyond their original use case and applying them directly on raw sensor data - typically RGB images - without any explicit engineering effort dedicated to low-level feature extraction required by traditional computer vision algorithms like structure from motion (SfM) or multi-view geometry. Inspired by the seminal work of Mildenhall et al., who proposed a method that infers depth maps and scene geometry from single monocular images based solely on learned features, we introduce a framework for few-shot view synthesis using deep neural rendering networks. Our approach trains a network for depth estimation, and then uses it for novel view synthesis through point cloud warping and refinement. We demonstrate significant improvements over current methods, both quantitatively on benchmark datasets and qualitatively via visualizations. We hope our work fosters research into new applications exploiting high resolution generative models trained end-to-end, allowing us to finally put Neural Radiance Fields on a diet!",1
"We consider the task of grasping a target object based on a natural language command query. Previous work primarily focused on localizing the object given the query, which requires a separate grasp detection module to grasp it. The cascaded application of two pipelines incurs errors in overlapping multi-object cases due to ambiguity in the individual outputs. This work proposes a model named Command Grasping Network(CGNet) to directly output command satisficing grasps from RGB image and textual command inputs. A dataset with ground truth (image, command, grasps) tuple is generated based on the VMRD dataset to train the proposed network. Experimental results on the generated test set show that CGNet outperforms a cascaded object-retrieval and grasp detection baseline by a large margin. Three physical experiments demonstrate the functionality and performance of CGNet.",0
"This article presents a novel method called “Joint network for grasp detection conditioned on natural language commands” that can detect objects in images as well as output instructions for how they should be grasped by robots based on those objects’ contexts. The goal is to enable robots to perform a wide variety of manipulation tasks involving different objects under natural language guidance. We propose a system architecture where deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) estimate pixelwise object proposals, followed by a graphical model which predicts one of the top N proposals using full image features including local low level edge maps, part Affordance fields and global scene evidence such as class confidence scores estimated from the same CNNs. Then we use reinforcement learning from human feedback to jointly optimize our perception module parameters, policy parameters and reward function to maximize task completion rates given natural language requests. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement over baseline methods for both RGBD data collection tasks and 2D webcam imagery datasets with simulated depth maps. We also provide detailed ablation studies analyzing effects of each component contribution to overall performance. Results show substantial progress towards solving complex manipulation problems guided solely by natural language instructions.",1
"The video captioning task is to describe the video contents with natural language by the machine. Many methods have been proposed for solving this task. A large dataset called MSR Video to Text (MSR-VTT) is often used as the benckmark dataset for testing the performance of the methods. However, we found that the human annotations, i.e., the descriptions of video contents in the dataset are quite noisy, e.g., there are many duplicate captions and many captions contain grammatical problems. These problems may pose difficulties to video captioning models for learning. We cleaned the MSR-VTT annotations by removing these problems, then tested several typical video captioning models on the cleaned dataset. Experimental results showed that data cleaning boosted the performances of the models measured by popular quantitative metrics. We recruited subjects to evaluate the results of a model trained on the original and cleaned datasets. The human behavior experiment demonstrated that trained on the cleaned dataset, the model generated captions that were more coherent and more relevant to contents of the video clips. The cleaned dataset is publicly available.",0
"Title: Improving Video Caption Quality through Automatic Annotations Cleaning  Annotation quality plays a critical role in the performance of video captioning models, which heavily rely on accurate annotations for training and evaluation. However, manually annotating large-scale datasets is time-consuming and expensive, leading to lower annotation accuracy or insufficient data size. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing an automatic annotation cleaning method that improves the quality of video captions in the widely used MSR-VTT dataset. Our approach first utilizes language model selection and filtering techniques to identify low-quality captions, followed by human validation to refine and correct erroneous annotations. We evaluate our method using standard metrics such as BLEU and METEOR, demonstrating significant improvements over the original annotations across different languages. Our study highlights the importance of high-quality annotations in the development of robust video captioning systems and presents a viable solution for efficient and effective dataset curation. Overall, this research contributes towards advancing the state-of-the-art in natural language processing and computer vision domains.",1
"Natural language video localization (NLVL), which aims to locate a target moment from a video that semantically corresponds to a text query, is a novel and challenging task. Toward this end, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the NLVL algorithms, where we first propose the pipeline of NLVL, and then categorize them into supervised and weakly-supervised methods, following by the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each kind of methods. Subsequently, we present the dataset, evaluation protocols and the general performance analysis. Finally, the possible perspectives are obtained by summarizing the existing methods.",0

They highlight the impact of natural language processing (NLP) techniques like semantic parsing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering in improving current systems. Finally, they present some future research directions towards a more general framework for NLP-based video analysis, where multiple modalities of input data could be combined seamlessly into a single pipeline using the power of deep learning models.",1
"Natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is one of the key components for service robots to be able to work in human-centric environments. In such dynamic environments, the robot needs to understand the intention of the user to accomplish a task successfully. Towards addressing this point, we propose a software architecture that segments a target object from a crowded scene, indicated verbally by a human user. At the core of our system, we employ a multi-modal deep neural network for visual grounding. Unlike most grounding methods that tackle the challenge using pre-trained object detectors via a two-stepped process, we develop a single stage zero-shot model that is able to provide predictions in unseen data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on real RGB-D data collected from public scene datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed model performs well in terms of accuracy and speed, while showcasing robustness to variation in the natural language input.",0
"Abstract: Robots equipped with cameras can observe humans performing tasks, but they often lack understanding of the context behind these actions. This problem becomes more challenging as robots need to generalize across multiple demonstrations from different users who may have diverse preferences or strategies. Our proposed solution utilizes deep neural networks that learn to ground visual observations into semantic natural language descriptions of human behavior. We present experimental results showing improved accuracy compared to prior work on both qualitative and quantitative metrics, including task success rates and user study evaluations by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can enable more expressive natural language interaction between humans and robots, allowing them to engage in richer conversations during collaborative activities.",1
"Tracking by natural language specification is a new rising research topic that aims at locating the target object in the video sequence based on its language description. Compared with traditional bounding box (BBox) based tracking, this setting guides object tracking with high-level semantic information, addresses the ambiguity of BBox, and links local and global search organically together. Those benefits may bring more flexible, robust and accurate tracking performance in practical scenarios. However, existing natural language initialized trackers are developed and compared on benchmark datasets proposed for tracking-by-BBox, which can't reflect the true power of tracking-by-language. In this work, we propose a new benchmark specifically dedicated to the tracking-by-language, including a large scale dataset, strong and diverse baseline methods. Specifically, we collect 2k video sequences (contains a total of 1,244,340 frames, 663 words) and split 1300/700 for the train/testing respectively. We densely annotate one sentence in English and corresponding bounding boxes of the target object for each video. We also introduce two new challenges into TNL2K for the object tracking task, i.e., adversarial samples and modality switch. A strong baseline method based on an adaptive local-global-search scheme is proposed for future works to compare. We believe this benchmark will greatly boost related researches on natural language guided tracking.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress made in developing object tracking methods that use natural language inputs to guide their behavior. This approach promises more accurate and flexible tracking compared to traditional methods which rely on hardcoded rules or templates. However, designing efficient algorithms capable of using natural language inputs remains challenging due to the complexity of human languages. Moreover, developing effective benchmarks for evaluating such systems remains an open problem. This work presents new algorithms for integrating symbolic knowledge into deep learning based trackers, as well as a novel benchmark for testing object tracking systems under varying levels of semantic ambiguity. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, further justifying our claims towards better accuracy and flexibility in object tracking via natural language inputs. Overall, we believe this research paves the way for future advancements in artificial intelligence by providing robust solutions towards building intelligent agents capable of understanding complex tasks expressed naturally through language.",1
"Localized Narratives is a dataset with detailed natural language descriptions of images paired with mouse traces that provide a sparse, fine-grained visual grounding for phrases. We propose TReCS, a sequential model that exploits this grounding to generate images. TReCS uses descriptions to retrieve segmentation masks and predict object labels aligned with mouse traces. These alignments are used to select and position masks to generate a fully covered segmentation canvas; the final image is produced by a segmentation-to-image generator using this canvas. This multi-step, retrieval-based approach outperforms existing direct text-to-image generation models on both automatic metrics and human evaluations: overall, its generated images are more photo-realistic and better match descriptions.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of models that can generate images from textual descriptions, opening up new possibilities in areas such as computer vision and virtual reality. However, these models often struggle with generating high-quality images that accurately capture the user's intended meaning. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on fine-grained attention mechanisms that allow users to provide explicit feedback at different levels of detail, from overall scene composition down to individual object features. Our method leverages this user input to guide the image generation process, resulting in more accurate and relevant outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and evaluations, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual fidelity, diversity, and alignment with user intent. Overall, our results highlight the potential of grounded text-to-image generation techniques to enable richer human-AI interaction in creative applications.",1
"Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a multimodal task where an agent follows natural language instructions and navigates in visual environments. Multiple setups have been proposed, and researchers apply new model architectures or training techniques to boost navigation performance. However, recent studies witness a slow-down in the performance improvements in both indoor and outdoor VLN tasks, and the agents' inner mechanisms for making navigation decisions remain unclear. To the best of our knowledge, the way the agents perceive the multimodal input is under-studied and clearly needs investigations. In this work, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments to unveil agents' focus during navigation. Results show that indoor navigation agents refer to both object tokens and direction tokens in the instruction when making decisions. In contrast, outdoor navigation agents heavily rely on direction tokens and have a poor understanding of the object tokens. Furthermore, instead of merely staring at surrounding objects, indoor navigation agents can set their sights on objects further from the current viewpoint. When it comes to vision-and-language alignments, many models claim that they are able to align object tokens with certain visual targets, but we cast doubt on the reliability of such alignments.",0
"Title: ""What Truly Counts in Vision-and-Language Navigation Research""  Researchers have made tremendous strides in developing advanced algorithms capable of navigating environments through natural language instructions, yet there remains a lack of consensus on how to evaluate these systems effectively. This paper seeks to address this gap by identifying key aspects that should be considered when assessing vision-and-language navigation models. Through a comprehensive literature review and analysis of state-of-the-art approaches, we argue that current evaluation methods often fall short in measuring crucial qualities such as interpretability, adaptability, explainability, robustness, and human-likeness. Instead, we propose a holistic framework that emphasizes understanding, generalization, trustworthiness, human interaction, and collaboration between humans and machines. Our findings provide valuable insights into the future direction of research, with implications for both academia and industry. By shifting our focus towards meaningful metrics, we can ensure that vision-and-language navigation technology becomes truly beneficial and accessible to all users.",1
"Recently, the Transformer module has been transplanted from natural language processing to computer vision. This paper applies the Transformer to video-based person re-identification, where the key issue is to extract the discriminative information from a tracklet. We show that, despite the strong learning ability, the vanilla Transformer suffers from an increased risk of over-fitting, arguably due to a large number of attention parameters and insufficient training data. To solve this problem, we propose a novel pipeline where the model is pre-trained on a set of synthesized video data and then transferred to the downstream domains with the perception-constrained Spatiotemporal Transformer (STT) module and Global Transformer (GT) module. The derived algorithm achieves significant accuracy gain on three popular video-based person re-identification benchmarks, MARS, DukeMTMC-VideoReID, and LS-VID, especially when the training and testing data are from different domains. More importantly, our research sheds light on the application of the Transformer on highly-structured visual data.",0
"Spatiotemporal Transformers have been recently proposed as an alternative architecture to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has achieved state-of-the-art results on several computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. In contrast to CNNs which rely heavily on learned kernels/filters and pooling operations, Spatiotemporal Transformers leverage self attention mechanisms allowing them to capture global dependencies without relying on explicit spatial pyramidal structures. However, these models often struggle at capturing long-range temporal dependencies since their self attention mechanism only focuses on the local context within each clip in a sliding window fashion rather than reasoning across longer video segments. Inspired by recent work that showed pretraining using masked action recognition can improve performance on video understanding problems, we explore whether leveraging a similar transformer trained for video action recognition could enable spatiotemporal representations better suited for person reidentification given a surveillance camera setup where multiple cameras observe different parts of a scene simultaneously. Given an unsegmented set of videos containing humans captured from disjoint camera views, our method uses a pairwise discriminative feature learning formulation in order to model appearance differences caused by viewpoint changes, occlusions, illumination variations and other nuisance factors like clothing style or hair color changes, while minimizing differences due to true identity switches. We evaluate our approach over three commonly used benchmark datasets and achieve competitive mAP scores on all of them showing the effectiveness of utilizing a large language model pretrained for visual representation learning. Our findings indicate that",1
"The advent of larger machine learning (ML) models have improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various modeling tasks, ranging from computer vision to natural language. As ML models continue increasing in size, so does their respective energy consumption and computational requirements. However, the methods for tracking, reporting, and comparing energy consumption remain limited. We presentEnergyVis, an interactive energy consumption tracker for ML models. Consisting of multiple coordinated views, EnergyVis enables researchers to interactively track, visualize and compare model energy consumption across key energy consumption and carbon footprint metrics (kWh and CO2), helping users explore alternative deployment locations and hardware that may reduce carbon footprints. EnergyVis aims to raise awareness concerning computational sustainability by interactively highlighting excessive energy usage during model training; and by providing alternative training options to reduce energy usage.",0
"This paper presents EnergyVis: An interactive tool that helps users track and explore energy consumption for machine learning models in real time. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the environmental impacts of training and deploying machine learning (ML) systems due to their high computational demands and increasingly widespread use. To this end, we have developed EnergyVis as part of our research into making sustainability considerations more tractable in ML workflows.  EnergyVis provides a clear overview of the relationships among datasets, algorithms, hyperparameters, and their associated energy usage, allowing users to quickly identify trends and correlations related to model performance and power consumption. Users can interactively adjust parameters such as batch size, model architecture, and dataset type using sliders and drop-down menus, immediately observing corresponding changes in accuracy metrics and energy consumption estimates on both the GPU and CPU. These estimates employ detailed calculations based on hardware configurations, power utilization, and other system characteristics obtained from standard sensors available on modern personal computers and cloud platforms.

"Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a natural language expression. Previous methods usually focus on designing an implicit and recurrent feature interaction mechanism to fuse the visual-linguistic features to directly generate the final segmentation mask without explicitly modeling the localization information of the referent instances. To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective by decoupling it into a ""Locate-Then-Segment"" (LTS) scheme. Given a language expression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding target image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object based on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual features to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model interaction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a light-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly effective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+ and +3.4% on RefCOCOg). In addition, our model is more interpretable with explicitly locating the object, which is also proved by visualization experiments. We believe this framework is promising to serve as a strong baseline for referring image segmentation.",0
"Our approach to referring image segmentation addresses two key challenges that arise due to incomplete object boundaries and ambiguity within images caused by occlusion. We present a novel pipeline that utilizes multi-level representation learning with human annotations to locate objects and guide their segmentations through interactive inputs. By focusing on shape consistency within our active contours model, we achieve accurate and efficient object localization as well as precise instance-specific boundary delineation. Our system has been validated against competing methods on benchmark datasets such as Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, surpassing state-of-the-art performance under certain metrics. As annotating ground truth data can become overwhelming for larger scale applications, our method offers a practical alternative capable of obtaining high quality results without excessive human intervention. Ultimately, our ""Locate then Segment"" strategy provides both accuracy and efficiency for users seeking detailed segmentations in complex scenes.",1
"Knowledge is captured in the form of entities and their relationships and stored in knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs enhance the capabilities of applications in many different areas including Web search, recommendation, and natural language understanding. This is mainly because, entities enable machines to understand things that go beyond simple tokens. Many modern algorithms use learned entity embeddings from these structured representations. However, building a knowledge graph takes time and effort, hence very costly and nontrivial. On the other hand, many Web sources describe entities in some structured format and therefore, finding ways to get them into useful entity knowledge is advantageous. We propose an approach that processes entity centric textual knowledge sources to learn entity embeddings and in turn avoids the need for a traditional knowledge graph. We first extract triples into the new representation format that does not use traditional complex triple extraction methods defined by pre-determined relationship labels. Then we learn entity embeddings through this new type of triples. We show that the embeddings learned from our approach are: (i) high quality and comparable to a known knowledge graph-based embeddings and can be used to improve them further, (ii) better than a contextual language model-based entity embeddings, and (iii) easy to compute and versatile in domain-specific applications where a knowledge graph is not readily available",0
"This should describe what kinds of tasks can be done using entity context graphs without ever explaining explicitly what they are (ie no sentence starting ""an EC graph is"") nor providing examples of entities that might appear in one.  Title: Semi-Structured Knowledge Extraction from Unstructured Data  With the vast amount of text data available online, extracting relevant knowledge from unstructured sources remains a challenging task. Traditional methods such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) have limited capabilities in identifying relationships among entities and understanding their contexts within semi-structured documents like tables and news articles. However, advanced techniques like entity context graphs offer promising solutions to these problems by enabling accurate identification and representation of entities and their connections across multiple levels. By leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing algorithms, we propose a methodology for constructing high-quality entity context graphs from diverse web resources. These representations facilitate efficient querying, reasoning, clustering, ranking, classification, validation, filtering, recommendation, summarization, and exploration - empowering developers, researchers, organizations, governments, and individuals alike to harness the full potential of big data insights. With significant applications spanning domains including science, healthcare, finance, social media, politics, entertainment, education, business intelligence, public safety, and more, the use cases for our approach showcase the tremendous impact possible through innovative technologies for making sense out of massive collections of messy digital content. Our experiments demonstrate promising results on benchmark datasets, indicating the robustness and effectiveness of this novel framework for realizing the exciting possibilities of open domain question answering systems, fact extraction services, semantic search engines, personal assistants, chatbots, expert advisors, conversational agents, intelligent dashboards, and smart decision support tools.

"Following the success in advancing natural language processing and understanding, transformers are expected to bring revolutionary changes to computer vision. This work provides the first and comprehensive study on the robustness of vision transformers (ViTs) against adversarial perturbations. Tested on various white-box and transfer attack settings, we find that ViTs possess better adversarial robustness when compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We summarize the following main observations contributing to the improved robustness of ViTs:   1) Features learned by ViTs contain less low-level information and are more generalizable, which contributes to superior robustness against adversarial perturbations.   2) Introducing convolutional or tokens-to-token blocks for learning low-level features in ViTs can improve classification accuracy but at the cost of adversarial robustness.   3) Increasing the proportion of transformers in the model structure (when the model consists of both transformer and CNN blocks) leads to better robustness. But for a pure transformer model, simply increasing the size or adding layers cannot guarantee a similar effect.   4) Pre-training on larger datasets does not significantly improve adversarial robustness though it is critical for training ViTs.   5) Adversarial training is also applicable to ViT for training robust models.   Furthermore, feature visualization and frequency analysis are conducted for explanation. The results show that ViTs are less sensitive to high-frequency perturbations than CNNs and there is a high correlation between how well the model learns low-level features and its robustness against different frequency-based perturbations.",0
"While transformer models have achieved great success in natural language processing tasks, their adversarial robustness remains unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of visual transformers using several state-of-the-art techniques from NLP attacks on vision systems. Our experiments show that while some attack methods are effective at fooling these models, others are largely ineffective due to the unique characteristics of image data. We find that preprocessing steps such as normalization can greatly improve model robustness, and propose a new training method based on adversarial examples to further enhance performance. Finally, we provide detailed analysis of model behavior during both successful and failed attacks, shedding light on potential strategies for improving model robustness moving forward. Overall, our work represents an important step towards better understanding the limitations of current generative adversarial networks, and highlights promising directions for future research.",1
"Research in the area of Vision and Language encompasses challenging topics that seek to connect visual and textual information. The video-to-text problem is one of these topics, in which the goal is to connect an input video with its textual description. This connection can be mainly made by retrieving the most significant descriptions from a corpus or generating a new one given a context video. These two ways represent essential tasks for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, called text retrieval from video task and video captioning/description task. These two tasks are substantially more complex than predicting or retrieving a single sentence from an image. The spatiotemporal information present in videos introduces diversity and complexity regarding the visual content and the structure of associated language descriptions. This review categorizes and describes the state-of-the-art techniques for the video-to-text problem. It covers the main video-to-text methods and the ways to evaluate their performance. We analyze how the most reported benchmark datasets have been created, showing their drawbacks and strengths for the problem requirements. We also show the impressive progress that researchers have made on each dataset, and we analyze why, despite this progress, the video-to-text conversion is still unsolved. State-of-the-art techniques are still a long way from achieving human-like performance in generating or retrieving video descriptions. We cover several significant challenges in the field and discuss future research directions.",0

"Neural networks training on edge terminals is essential for edge AI computing, which needs to be adaptive to evolving environment. Quantised models can efficiently run on edge devices, but existing training methods for these compact models are designed to run on powerful servers with abundant memory and energy budget. For example, quantisation-aware training (QAT) method involves two copies of model parameters, which is usually beyond the capacity of on-chip memory in edge devices. Data movement between off-chip and on-chip memory is energy demanding as well. The resource requirements are trivial for powerful servers, but critical for edge devices. To mitigate these issues, We propose Resource Constrained Training (RCT). RCT only keeps a quantised model throughout the training, so that the memory requirements for model parameters in training is reduced. It adjusts per-layer bitwidth dynamically in order to save energy when a model can learn effectively with lower precision. We carry out experiments with representative models and tasks in image application and natural language processing. Experiments show that RCT saves more than 86\% energy for General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) and saves more than 46\% memory for model parameters, with limited accuracy loss. Comparing with QAT-based method, RCT saves about half of energy on moving model parameters.",0
"Introduction: In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that can operate on resource constrained devices such as smartphones, wearables, and other edge computing platforms. However, training these models requires large amounts of data and computational resources which may not always be available at the edge. This work proposes a novel approach called ""Resource Constrained Training"" (RCT) for optimizing AI model performance under limited training resources. Methods: We use several popular machine learning algorithms including deep neural networks (DNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), random decision trees (RDTs), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) as case studies in our experiments. Our approach involves two main steps: i) pruning the models to reduce their complexity while maintaining accuracy, ii) using transfer learning techniques such as fine-tuning and distillation to improve generalization performance. Results: Experiments conducted across various datasets show that our method significantly reduces the number of parameters without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by combining both methods, we achieve better results than simply applying either one independently. Discussion: Our findings suggest that RCT provides a promising framework for building efficient and effective AI models on resource constrained devices. Future research directions include exploring more advanced pruning techniques and evaluating different types of regularizations in combination with RCT. Overall, RCT presents opportunities for enabling real-time inference on AI applications in various domains like computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.",1
"Deep learning model (primarily convolutional networks and LSTM) for time series classification has been studied broadly by the community with the wide applications in different domains like healthcare, finance, industrial engineering and IoT. Meanwhile, Transformer Networks recently achieved frontier performance on various natural language processing and computer vision tasks. In this work, we explored a simple extension of the current Transformer Networks with gating, named Gated Transformer Networks (GTN) for the multivariate time series classification problem. With the gating that merges two towers of Transformer which model the channel-wise and step-wise correlations respectively, we show how GTN is naturally and effectively suitable for the multivariate time series classification task. We conduct comprehensive experiments on thirteen dataset with full ablation study. Our results show that GTN is able to achieve competing results with current state-of-the-art deep learning models. We also explored the attention map for the natural interpretability of GTN on time series modeling. Our preliminary results provide a strong baseline for the Transformer Networks on multivariate time series classification task and grounds the foundation for future research.",0
"Gated transformer networks have recently emerged as powerful models for natural language processing tasks, but their application in time series classification has been limited due to the inherent sequential structure of the data. In this work, we propose using gated transformers for multivariate time series classification by incorporating temporal dependencies through attention mechanisms. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while providing interpretable features that capture complex patterns in the data. This study highlights the potential of integrating transformers into time series analysis, opening up new opportunities for research in this domain.",1
"Although transfer learning is proven to be effective in computer vision and natural language processing applications, it is rarely investigated in forecasting financial time series. Majority of existing works on transfer learning are based on single-source transfer learning due to the availability of open-access large-scale datasets. However, in financial domain, the lengths of individual time series are relatively short and single-source transfer learning models are less effective. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate multi-source deep transfer learning for financial time series. We propose two multi-source transfer learning methods namely Weighted Average Ensemble for Transfer Learning (WAETL) and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Ensemble Selection (TPEES). The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on financial time series extracted from stock markets. Experiment results reveal that TPEES outperforms other baseline methods on majority of multi-source transfer tasks.",0
"Incorporating multiple data sources into a machine learning model can improve forecast accuracy. However, effectively utilizing heterogeneous datasets from diverse domains remains challenging due to differences in scale, distribution, quality, and correlation structure. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel multi-source transfer learning framework that leverages knowledge transferred from previous tasks via pre-trained models, ensembles learned across different sources, and domain adaptation techniques. Our proposed methodology is applied to financial time series prediction problems involving mixed frequency, seasonality, trend, and cross-sectional dependencies. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over single-source benchmarks as well as other state-of-the-art methods based on deep neural networks (DNN) with gradient boosting machines (XGBoost), attention mechanisms (Attention-LSTM), adversarial training (DAT), generative adversarial imitation (GAIN), transfer reinforcement learning (TRL). We showcase how each component of our framework contributes incrementally towards better performance under varying degrees of complexity introduced by multiple source configurations. Lastly, we provide interpretability analysis and outlier detection during inference time, highlighting the benefits of using self-supervised representation learning for financial signal processing tasks.",1
"The dominant approaches to text representation in natural language rely on learning embeddings on massive corpora which have convenient properties such as compositionality and distance preservation. In this paper, we develop a novel method to learn a heavy-tailed embedding with desirable regularity properties regarding the distributional tails, which allows to analyze the points far away from the distribution bulk using the framework of multivariate extreme value theory. In particular, a classifier dedicated to the tails of the proposed embedding is obtained which performance outperforms the baseline. This classifier exhibits a scale invariance property which we leverage by introducing a novel text generation method for label preserving dataset augmentation. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real text data demonstrate the relevance of the proposed framework and confirm that this method generates meaningful sentences with controllable attribute, e.g. positive or negative sentiment.",0
"Natural language processing (NLP) has been at the forefront of many research fields due to advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence. One of these fields is text classification which deals with categorizing pieces of text into predefined classes based on their content. With the growth in social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit comes more unstructured data that may contain offensive or polarized texts. In order to effectively classify this type of data, heavy-tail representations have proven effective by allowing the model to capture both skewness and excess kurtosis present in the data. We propose two different types of representations: Pareto Smooth Skewed Gaussians (PSSGs) which capture tail heaviness, skewness, and light tails; and Inverse Gaussian (IG) distributions that can account for the entire range of the distribution including the tail region. The proposed models outperform traditional normal mixture models commonly used in NLP. Furthermore, we demonstrate how data augmentation techniques can improve performance even further with limited additional training data. Our results show that using heavy-tailed representations paired with data augmentation yield better accuracy than previous state-of-the-art methods. The implications of our work are far reaching and could lead to improved models for sentiment analysis, opinion mining, topic labeling and other applications where unstructured data plays a key role.",1
"Curriculum learning (CL) is a training strategy that trains a machine learning model from easier data to harder data, which imitates the meaningful learning order in human curricula. As an easy-to-use plug-in, the CL strategy has demonstrated its power in improving the generalization capacity and convergence rate of various models in a wide range of scenarios such as computer vision and natural language processing etc. In this survey article, we comprehensively review CL from various aspects including motivations, definitions, theories, and applications. We discuss works on curriculum learning within a general CL framework, elaborating on how to design a manually predefined curriculum or an automatic curriculum. In particular, we summarize existing CL designs based on the general framework of Difficulty Measurer+Training Scheduler and further categorize the methodologies for automatic CL into four groups, i.e., Self-paced Learning, Transfer Teacher, RL Teacher, and Other Automatic CL. We also analyze principles to select different CL designs that may benefit practical applications. Finally, we present our insights on the relationships connecting CL and other machine learning concepts including transfer learning, meta-learning, continual learning and active learning, etc., then point out challenges in CL as well as potential future research directions deserving further investigations.",0
"Here are some drafts to choose from:  * This survey article investigates current approaches and techniques used in artificial intelligence (AI) related to curriculum learning, which refers to training deep neural networks through task selection that maximizes improvement. We provide an overview of recent work in this area along with their advantages and disadvantages. Our goal was to give an up-to-date picture of cutting-edge advancements within this specific branch of AI research.  To create this survey we conducted a thorough search of academic publications using digital libraries such as WebOfScience. An initial list of papers was gathered by searching key phrases like “curriculum learning”, “progressive network” and others. From there we carefully evaluated each publication based upon relevance to our focus and included them within this review. In total we present nineteen papers that cover state-of-the art methods found in the literature, which have been grouped into five categories: methods without memory-related constraints, those with regularization mechanisms applied during every iteration, and ones that enforce upper bounds on computational resources. For every approach discussed we analyzed its contribution as well as any possible drawbacks within experiments carried out by the authors themselves. As a result readers can now make informed decisions on whether these models may apply to their own projects while gaining insights into open challenges currently faced by the field at large. Overall, the aim is to serve both practitioners interested in machine learning problems as well as theoreticians looking for future research opportunities.* AI agents need to learn new tasks quickly in order to keep up with fast changes in the real world. One method to achieve this is via curriculum learning. This involves selecting tasks which maximize improvement of a model. Despite the interest in this topic, little has been done to gather together all existing research regarding different types of curricula for continuous control learning and how they compare.

"In video object tracking, there exist rich temporal contexts among successive frames, which have been largely overlooked in existing trackers. In this work, we bridge the individual video frames and explore the temporal contexts across them via a transformer architecture for robust object tracking. Different from classic usage of the transformer in natural language processing tasks, we separate its encoder and decoder into two parallel branches and carefully design them within the Siamese-like tracking pipelines. The transformer encoder promotes the target templates via attention-based feature reinforcement, which benefits the high-quality tracking model generation. The transformer decoder propagates the tracking cues from previous templates to the current frame, which facilitates the object searching process. Our transformer-assisted tracking framework is neat and trained in an end-to-end manner. With the proposed transformer, a simple Siamese matching approach is able to outperform the current top-performing trackers. By combining our transformer with the recent discriminative tracking pipeline, our method sets several new state-of-the-art records on prevalent tracking benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, visual tracking remains challenging due to factors like occlusion, motion blur, illumination changes, and camera movements. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that combines a transformer network and a tracker.  The transformer provides global temporal context by modeling interactions among patches throughout the video sequence, enabling it to capture patterns that traditional trackers miss. Meanwhile, the tracker serves two purposes: (i) providing accurate initial bounding boxes, which reduces drift caused by incorrect starting positions; and (ii) enforcing spatial constraints during inference, ensuring that predictions stay within the ground truth bounding box.  Our experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers across all evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and area under curve. Additionally, ablation studies show that both components contribute significantly to our success. Finally, our approach generalizes well to unseen domains and achieves competitive performance compared against previous methods trained on much larger datasets.  In summary, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that leverages the strengths of both transformers and trackers to address challenges in visual tracking. Our results set a new bar for accuracy and robustness in this task, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques for computer vision problems beyond image understanding.",1
"It is encouraged to see that progress has been made to bridge videos and natural language. However, mainstream video captioning methods suffer from slow inference speed due to the sequential manner of autoregressive decoding, and prefer generating generic descriptions due to the insufficient training of visual words (e.g., nouns and verbs) and inadequate decoding paradigm. In this paper, we propose a non-autoregressive decoding based model with a coarse-to-fine captioning procedure to alleviate these defects. In implementations, we employ a bi-directional self-attention based network as our language model for achieving inference speedup, based on which we decompose the captioning procedure into two stages, where the model has different focuses. Specifically, given that visual words determine the semantic correctness of captions, we design a mechanism of generating visual words to not only promote the training of scene-related words but also capture relevant details from videos to construct a coarse-grained sentence ""template"". Thereafter, we devise dedicated decoding algorithms that fill in the ""template"" with suitable words and modify inappropriate phrasing via iterative refinement to obtain a fine-grained description. Extensive experiments on two mainstream video captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSVD and MSR-VTT, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, generates diverse descriptions, and obtains high inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/yangbang18/Non-Autoregressive-Video-Captioning.",0
"Here is a sample abstract for your consideration: ``` High quality video caption generation has proven to be a challenging task due to several factors such as computational cost, training data scarcity, and difficulty in model understanding. In recent years, autoregressive models have been widely used for generating accurate and diverse descriptions of videos. However, these models tend to generate lower quality outputs at early time steps, which leads to inferior overall results compared to non-autoregressive approaches that can generate high quality descriptions from the outset. This research proposes a novel coarse-to-fine approach using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for efficient feature extraction followed by recurrent layers and attention mechanisms for fine-grained caption generation. Experimental evaluation shows significant improvements over previous state-of-the art methods on benchmark datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate qualitative analysis showing the effectiveness of our proposed method in capturing important visual elements in the video frames.

"Cognitive grammar suggests that the acquisition of language grammar is grounded within visual structures. While grammar is an essential representation of natural language, it also exists ubiquitously in vision to represent the hierarchical part-whole structure. In this work, we study grounded grammar induction of vision and language in a joint learning framework. Specifically, we present VLGrammar, a method that uses compound probabilistic context-free grammars (compound PCFGs) to induce the language grammar and the image grammar simultaneously. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to guide the joint learning of both modules. To provide a benchmark for the grounded grammar induction task, we collect a large-scale dataset, \textsc{PartIt}, which contains human-written sentences that describe part-level semantics for 3D objects. Experiments on the \textsc{PartIt} dataset show that VLGrammar outperforms all baselines in image grammar induction and language grammar induction. The learned VLGrammar naturally benefits related downstream tasks. Specifically, it improves the image unsupervised clustering accuracy by 30\%, and performs well in image retrieval and text retrieval. Notably, the induced grammar shows superior generalizability by easily generalizing to unseen categories.",0
"""VLGrammar"" presents a novel approach for inducing joint grammar models that unify visual representations and natural language descriptions. By leveraging grounded corpora in which images and sentences are paired based on human annotations, our method learns shared linguistic structures across vision and language modalities. We validate our model on challenging tasks such as zero-shot image generation, scene understanding, and program synthesis from human instructions, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art alternatives. Our work highlights the importance of holistic multimodal modeling for advancing artificial intelligence and bridging the gap between high-level semantics and low-level perception.",1
"Humans learn from life events to form intuitions towards the understanding of visual environments and languages. Envision that you are instructed by a high-level instruction, ""Go to the bathroom in the master bedroom and replace the blue towel on the left wall"", what would you possibly do to carry out the task? Intuitively, we comprehend the semantics of the instruction to form an overview of where a bathroom is and what a blue towel is in mind; then, we navigate to the target location by consistently matching the bathroom appearance in mind with the current scene. In this paper, we present an agent that mimics such human behaviors. Specifically, we focus on the Remote Embodied Visual Referring Expression in Real Indoor Environments task, called REVERIE, where an agent is asked to correctly localize a remote target object specified by a concise high-level natural language instruction, and propose a two-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, we pretrain the agent with two cross-modal alignment sub-tasks, namely the Scene Grounding task and the Object Grounding task. The agent learns where to stop in the Scene Grounding task and what to attend to in the Object Grounding task respectively. Then, to generate action sequences, we propose a memory-augmented attentive action decoder to smoothly fuse the pre-trained vision and language representations with the agent's past memory experiences. Without bells and whistles, experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.",0

The results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

In this survey, we provide a unified review of different ways of training GNNs using SSL. Specifically, we categorize SSL methods into contrastive and predictive models. In either category, we provide a unified framework for methods as well as how these methods differ in each component under the framework. Our unified treatment of SSL methods for GNNs sheds light on the similarities and differences of various methods, setting the stage for developing new methods and algorithms.

"Decompilation is the procedure of transforming binary programs into a high-level representation, such as source code, for human analysts to examine. While modern decompilers can reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation, inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing, we propose a novel solution to infer variable names in decompiled code based on Masked Language Modeling, Byte-Pair Encoding, and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes \textit{raw} decompiler output, the less semantically meaningful code, as input, and enriches it using our proposed \textit{finetuning} technique, Constrained Masked Language Modeling. Using Constrained Masked Language Modeling introduces the challenge of predicting the number of masked tokens for the original variable name. We address this \textit{count of token prediction} challenge with our post-processing algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our trained VarBERT model is simpler and of much better performance. We evaluated our model on an existing large-scale data set with 164,632 binaries and showed that it can predict variable names identical to the ones present in the original source code up to 84.15\% of the time.",0
"Abstract: As software becomes increasingly ubiquitous and complex, reverse engineering has gained importance as an effective tool for understanding how code works, identifying security vulnerabilities, debugging errors, improving performance, and recovering lost source code by inferring variable names from compiled binary files using deobfuscation techniques like control flow graph (CFG) recovery, stack trace analysis, dynamic taint analysis, and symbolic execution. In recent years, machine learning methods have been applied successfully to improve several steps in the reverse engineering pipeline. However, existing approaches largely ignore the semantic relationship between tokens in natural language programs and program variables. In this paper, we present a novel method based on constrained masked language modeling that explicitly models the correlation between natural language-like code sequences and corresponding variable names. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deobfuscating tools and demonstrates superior accuracy compared to previous ML-based solutions without any need for external resources, such as internet access during inference time or pre-training on large datasets. We evaluate our proposed model across multiple benchmarks and use cases, highlighting its effectiveness at recovering accurate, high-entropy, and contextually relevant variable names even in heavily obfuscated binaries. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating simple syntax constraints can further boost performance. Overall, our work advances the field of variable name recovery and underscores the viability and potential benefits of integrating NLP techniques into modern DE practices.",1

"Among image classification, skip and densely-connection-based networks have dominated most leaderboards. Recently, from the successful development of multi-head attention in natural language processing, it is sure that now is a time of either using a Transformer-like model or hybrid CNNs with attention. However, the former need a tremendous resource to train, and the latter is in the perfect balance in this direction. In this work, to make CNNs handle global and local information, we proposed UPANets, which equips channel-wise attention with a hybrid skip-densely-connection structure. Also, the extreme-connection structure makes UPANets robust with a smoother loss landscape. In experiments, UPANets surpassed most well-known and widely-used SOTAs with an accuracy of 96.47% in Cifar-10, 80.29% in Cifar-100, and 67.67% in Tiny Imagenet.

"Convolutional video models have an order of magnitude larger computational complexity than their counterpart image-level models. Constrained by computational resources, there is no model or training method that can train long video sequences end-to-end. Currently, the main-stream method is to split a raw video into clips, leading to incomplete fragmentary temporal information flow. Inspired by natural language processing techniques dealing with long sentences, we propose to treat videos as serial fragments satisfying Markov property, and train it as a whole by progressively propagating information through the temporal dimension in multiple steps. This progressive training (PGT) method is able to train long videos end-to-end with limited resources and ensures the effective transmission of information. As a general and robust training method, we empirically demonstrate that it yields significant performance improvements on different models and datasets. As an illustrative example, the proposed method improves SlowOnly network by 3.7 mAP on Charades and 1.9 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics with negligible parameter and computation overhead.

"Deep supervised learning has achieved great success in the last decade. However, its deficiencies of dependence on manual labels and vulnerability to attacks have driven people to explore a better solution. As an alternative, self-supervised learning attracts many researchers for its soaring performance on representation learning in the last several years.

"Title: ""Self-Supervised Learning: An Analysis of Generative versus Contrastive Approaches""  Abstract:  The field of machine learning has seen significant advancements due to the rise of self-supervised learning (SSL), which enables algorithms to learn from unlabeled data without explicit guidance. There are two main approaches within SSL: generative models that aim to generate new instances resembling those found in the training set, and contrastive models that learn representations by maximizing agreement between augmentations of similar inputs. This study aims to compare these two methods in terms of their effectiveness and applicability across different datasets and domains. Our analysis shows that both generative and contrastive approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses depending on the task at hand, making it important to carefully consider the choice of model for any given problem. We hope our findings provide insights into the design of future SSL systems and spur further research in this exciting area.",1
"Concentration inequalities are widely used for analyzing machine learning algorithms. However, current concentration inequalities cannot be applied to some of the most popular deep neural networks, notably in natural language processing. This is mostly due to the non-causal nature of such involved data, in the sense that each data point depends on other neighbor data points. In this paper, a framework for modeling non-causal random fields is provided and a Hoeffding-type concentration inequality is obtained for this framework. The proof of this result relies on a local approximation of the non-causal random field by a function of a finite number of i.i.d. random variables.",0
"Machine learning algorithms have proven to be highly effective at solving complex problems across various domains. However, most modern approaches rely on causality assumptions that may not hold in practice. Non-causal models have been proposed as alternatives but often suffer from poor generalization performance.

We show that our method can significantly improve the accuracy of non-causal models compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets and showcase its advantage over competing baselines. Furthermore, we provide insights into the behavior of deviation bounds by analyzing its theoretical properties, including the connection between deviation bounds and adversarial training, leading to novel improvements in robustness against input variations.

"The attention mechanism has been widely used in deep neural networks as a model component. By now, it has become a critical building block in many state-of-the-art natural language models. Despite its great success established empirically, the working mechanism of attention has not been investigated at a sufficient theoretical depth to date. In this paper, we set up a simple text classification task and study the dynamics of training a simple attention-based classification model using gradient descent. In this setting, we show that, for the discriminative words that the model should attend to, a persisting identity exists relating its embedding and the inner product of its key and the query. This allows us to prove that training must converge to attending to the discriminative words when the attention output is classified by a linear classifier. Experiments are performed, which validate our theoretical analysis and provide further insights.",0

"Language model pre-training (LMPT) has achieved remarkable results in natural language understanding. However, LMPT is much less successful in non-natural language domains like protein sequences, revealing a crucial discrepancy between the various sequential domains. Here, we posit that while LMPT can effectively model per-token relations, it fails at modeling per-sequence relations in non-natural language domains. To this end, we develop a framework that couples LMPT with deep structure-preserving metric learning to produce richer embeddings than can be obtained from LMPT alone. We examine new and existing pre-training models in this framework and theoretically analyze the framework overall. We also design experiments on a variety of synthetic datasets and new graph-augmented datasets of proteins and scientific abstracts. Our approach offers notable performance improvements on downstream tasks, including prediction of protein remote homology and classification of citation intent.",0

"Multi-Task Learning (MTL) networks have emerged as a promising method for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction, we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by 0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.

"A novel approach has been developed that improves transfer learning in natural language processing (NLP) using fewer parameters and less data. This method, known as conditionally adaptive multi-task learning, allows multiple tasks to share the same neural network architecture while allowing each task to learn unique representations that are optimized specifically for their individual goals. By doing so, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance on low-resource benchmarks while maintaining strong generalization capabilities across all tasks. Our method achieves this balance by dynamically selecting which layers in the shared model receive gradient updates during training, based on the current task at hand. With this simple change, our model can now perform more effectively with far fewer parameters than traditional methods would require. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system through rigorous testing and provide a detailed analysis of its strengths and limitations compared to existing approaches in the field. Overall, we believe this work provides valuable insights into how to improve the efficiency and efficacy of large-scale NLP models, particularly in challenging environments where resources may be scarce. Our findings have important implications for future research into the design and development of modern deep learning systems and reinforces the importance of exploring new ways to optimize these complex architectures.",1
"Machine Learning in general and Deep Learning in particular has gained much interest in the recent decade and has shown significant performance improvements for many Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing tasks. In order to deal with databases which have just a small amount of training samples or to deal with models which have large amount of parameters, the regularization is indispensable. In this paper, we enforce the manifold preservation (manifold learning) from the original data into latent presentation by using ""manifold attack"". The later is inspired in a fashion of adversarial learning : finding virtual points that distort mostly the manifold preservation then using these points as supplementary samples to train the model. We show that our approach of regularization provides improvements for the accuracy rate and for the robustness to adversarial examples.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing concern over adversarial attacks against machine learning models. Adversarial examples, deliberately generated inputs designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions, pose a serious challenge to the reliability and security of these systems. This study proposes a new approach called ""Manifold Attack"" that exploits the geometric properties of high dimensional spaces and can generate highly effective adversarial examples with little prior knowledge. The key insight behind our method is that the decision boundary of many machine learning algorithms takes on a complex nonlinear form even in high dimensions, leading to multiple ""manifolds"" in the feature space along which successful attacks can be constructed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manifold Attack through extensive experiments across different types of deep neural networks and datasets, showing that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the intrinsic geometry of data distributions for both developing better machine learning algorithms and defending against potential attacks.",1
"Data augmentation is an effective technique to improve the generalization of deep neural networks. However, previous data augmentation methods usually treat the augmented samples equally without considering their individual impacts on the model. To address this, for the augmented samples from the same training example, we propose to assign different weights to them. We construct the maximal expected loss which is the supremum over any reweighted loss on augmented samples. Inspired by adversarial training, we minimize this maximal expected loss (MMEL) and obtain a simple and interpretable closed-form solution: more attention should be paid to augmented samples with large loss values (i.e., harder examples). Minimizing this maximal expected loss enables the model to perform well under any reweighting strategy. The proposed method can generally be applied on top of any data augmentation methods. Experiments are conducted on both natural language understanding tasks with token-level data augmentation, and image classification tasks with commonly-used image augmentation techniques like random crop and horizontal flip. Empirical results show that the proposed method improves the generalization performance of the model.",0
"In this paper we present the problem of reweighting augmented samples minimizing the maximal expected loss, which provides a principled approach for ensuring that the generated samples have desirable properties such as class balance and inclusion of rare events. To address this problem we propose a novel framework based on importance sampling techniques from probability theory, and develop algorithms that can efficiently implement this approach for both continuous and discrete distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing that our algorithm can effectively improve model performance while reducing training time compared to alternative approaches.",1
"We aim to address the problem of Natural Language Video Localization (NLVL)-localizing the video segment corresponding to a natural language description in a long and untrimmed video. State-of-the-art NLVL methods are almost in one-stage fashion, which can be typically grouped into two categories: 1) anchor-based approach: it first pre-defines a series of video segment candidates (e.g., by sliding window), and then does classification for each candidate; 2) anchor-free approach: it directly predicts the probabilities for each video frame as a boundary or intermediate frame inside the positive segment. However, both kinds of one-stage approaches have inherent drawbacks: the anchor-based approach is susceptible to the heuristic rules, further limiting the capability of handling videos with variant length. While the anchor-free approach fails to exploit the segment-level interaction thus achieving inferior results. In this paper, we propose a novel Boundary Proposal Network (BPNet), a universal two-stage framework that gets rid of the issues mentioned above. Specifically, in the first stage, BPNet utilizes an anchor-free model to generate a group of high-quality candidate video segments with their boundaries. In the second stage, a visual-language fusion layer is proposed to jointly model the multi-modal interaction between the candidate and the language query, followed by a matching score rating layer that outputs the alignment score for each candidate. We evaluate our BPNet on three challenging NLVL benchmarks (i.e., Charades-STA, TACoS and ActivityNet-Captions). Extensive experiments and ablative studies on these datasets demonstrate that the BPNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for natural language video localization based on boundary proposals. Our method addresses two key challenges in current state-of-the-art approaches for NLVL: (i) limited representation power of individual bounding boxes due to their rigid nature, and (ii) computational inefficiency caused by exhaustive search over all possible combinations of object detections. To overcome these limitations, we propose using boundary proposal networks that generate flexible and accurate boundaries around objects. We show that our network can effectively capture the rich semantic information present in natural language queries, leading to more precise localizations. Additionally, we introduce a new two-stage architecture where the first stage generates coarse, but efficient, localizations followed by refinement at the second stage. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods across multiple datasets. Our approach sets a new standard for efficiency and accuracy in natural language video localization research.",1
"Negotiation, as an essential and complicated aspect of online shopping, is still challenging for an intelligent agent. To that end, we propose the Price Negotiator, a modular deep neural network that addresses the unsolved problems in recent studies by (1) considering images of the items as a crucial, though neglected, source of information in a negotiation, (2) heuristically finding the most similar items from an external online source to predict the potential value and an acceptable agreement price, (3) predicting a general price-based action at each turn which is fed into the language generator to output the supporting natural language, and (4) adjusting the prices based on the predicted actions. Empirically, we show that our model, that is trained in both supervised and reinforcement learning setting, significantly improves negotiation on the CraigslistBargain dataset, in terms of the agreement price, price consistency, and dialogue quality.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to negotiation that leverages online value look-ahead (OVL) techniques to improve the negotiating process. OVL involves using available information to predict future values and make better decisions based on those predictions. In the context of negotiation, OVL can be used to identify areas where parties may have different beliefs about the value of goods or services, allowing them to find common ground and reach agreements more efficiently.  The proposed method uses game theory to model negotiation scenarios and guide decision making. By looking ahead at potential outcomes, negotiators can evaluate the consequences of their actions and adjust their strategies accordingly. This allows both sides to arrive at mutually beneficial agreements while minimizing risk and uncertainty.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing significant improvements over traditional negotiation methods. The paper concludes by discussing future directions for research in this area, including expanding the scope of OVL applications and exploring new ways to incorporate machine learning into negotiation processes. Overall, the work presented here offers valuable insights into the use of technology in negotiations and has important implications for businesses, policymakers, and society as a whole.",1
"We present a locality preserving loss (LPL) that improves the alignment between vector space embeddings while separating uncorrelated representations. Given two pretrained embedding manifolds, LPL optimizes a model to project an embedding and maintain its local neighborhood while aligning one manifold to another. This reduces the overall size of the dataset required to align the two in tasks such as cross-lingual word alignment. We show that the LPL-based alignment between input vector spaces acts as a regularizer, leading to better and consistent accuracy than the baseline, especially when the size of the training set is small. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LPL optimized alignment on semantic text similarity (STS), natural language inference (SNLI), multi-genre language inference (MNLI) and cross-lingual word alignment(CLA) showing consistent improvements, finding up to 16% improvement over our baseline in lower resource settings.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for preserving locality in deep learning models, which is important for applications where spatial relationships among features matter. We introduce a novel loss function we call ""locality preserving loss"" (LPL) that encourages neighboring points in the data space to have similar representations in the feature space. Our method works by penalizing large distances between neighbors in both data space and feature space simultaneously, effectively aligning them close together. By minimizing our LPL during training, we show significant improvements over baseline methods on several challenging tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation. Importantly, our method requires no changes to existing neural network architectures, making it easy to adopt in practice. In summary, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of our LPL in producing more locally coherent embeddings while achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple domains.",1
"Integration is indispensable, not only in mathematics, but also in a wide range of other fields. A deep learning method has recently been developed and shown to be capable of integrating mathematical functions that could not previously be integrated on a computer. However, that method treats integration as equivalent to natural language translation and does not reflect mathematical information. In this study, we adjusted the learning model to take mathematical information into account and developed a wide range of learning models that learn the order of numerical operations more robustly. In this way, we achieved a 98.80% correct answer rate with symbolic integration, a higher rate than that of any existing method. We judged the correctness of the integration based on whether the derivative of the primitive function was consistent with the integrand. By building an integrated model based on this strategy, we achieved a 99.79% rate of correct answers with symbolic integration.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to symbolic integration that combines multiple learning models with complementary strengths and weaknesses. Our method leverages recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), which have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex integration problems. However, DNNs can struggle when faced with input functions outside their training distribution or when asked to perform highly accurate numerical computations. To address these limitations, we propose augmenting our DNN integration model with traditional symbolic calculus methods and other machine learning techniques that excel at handling special function classes, Diophantine approximations, and analytical continuation. We evaluate our hybrid system using benchmark tests from diverse mathematical areas such as number theory, physics, signal processing, and computer graphics. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over standalone integration models in terms of speed, accuracy, and reliability. We conclude that combining learning models with different capabilities offers significant benefits for tackling hard integration challenges beyond human comprehension and tractability.",1
"Transformer is a powerful tool for many natural language tasks which is based on self-attention, a mechanism that encodes the dependence of other tokens on each specific token, but the computation of self-attention is a bottleneck due to its quadratic time complexity. There are various approaches to reduce the time complexity and approximation of matrix is one such. In Nystr\""omformer, the authors used Nystr\""om based method for approximation of softmax. The Nystr\""om method generates a fast approximation to any large-scale symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix using only a few columns of the SPSD matrix. However, since the Nystr\""om approximation is low-rank when the spectrum of the SPSD matrix decays slowly, the Nystr\""om approximation is of low accuracy. Here an alternative method is proposed for approximation which has a much stronger error bound than the Nystr\""om method. The time complexity of this same as Nystr\""omformer which is $O\left({n}\right)$.",0
In this paper we propose an alternative to the widely popular Nyströmformer architecture which approximates global attention through local attention. Our method introduces spectral shifting to reduce complexity while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate our approach on four NLP benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results without requiring large models. This work demonstrates that attention approximations can indeed improve performance beyond previous methods.,1
"Due to the rapid emergence of short videos and the requirement for content understanding and creation, the video captioning task has received increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we convert traditional video captioning task into a new paradigm, \ie, Open-book Video Captioning, which generates natural language under the prompts of video-content-relevant sentences, not limited to the video itself. To address the open-book video captioning problem, we propose a novel Retrieve-Copy-Generate network, where a pluggable video-to-text retriever is constructed to retrieve sentences as hints from the training corpus effectively, and a copy-mechanism generator is introduced to extract expressions from multi-retrieved sentences dynamically. The two modules can be trained end-to-end or separately, which is flexible and extensible. Our framework coordinates the conventional retrieval-based methods with orthodox encoder-decoder methods, which can not only draw on the diverse expressions in the retrieved sentences but also generate natural and accurate content of the video. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art performance, indicating the effectiveness and promising of the proposed paradigm in the task of video captioning.",0
"This research presents an approach to open-book video captioning using a retrieval system combined with deep learning models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We introduce a novel architecture that utilizes both textual context from external sources such as subtitles or closed-captioned transcripts and visual content from the input video. Our model leverages state-of-the-art machine translation techniques to retrieve relevant sections of text from books related to the topic of the video, which can then be used along with the generated captions to improve accuracy and coherence. Evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over previous approaches, achieving impressive results comparable to human performance. Additionally, we showcase our method’s ability to generate accurate descriptions for challenging scenarios involving unconventional events, minority languages, and complex concepts.",1
"In meta-learning, the knowledge learned from previous tasks is transferred to new ones, but this transfer only works if tasks are related. Sharing information between unrelated tasks might hurt performance, and it is unclear how to transfer knowledge across tasks with a hierarchical structure. Our research extends a model agnostic meta-learning model, MAML, by exploiting hierarchical task relationships. Our algorithm, TreeMAML, adapts the model to each task with a few gradient steps, but the adaptation follows the hierarchical tree structure: in each step, gradients are pooled across tasks clusters, and subsequent steps follow down the tree. We also implement a clustering algorithm that generates the tasks tree without previous knowledge of the task structure, allowing us to make use of implicit relationships between the tasks. We show that the new algorithm, which we term TreeMAML, performs better than MAML when the task structure is hierarchical for synthetic experiments. To study the performance of the method in real-world data, we apply this method to Natural Language Understanding, we use our algorithm to finetune Language Models taking advantage of the language phylogenetic tree. We show that TreeMAML improves the state of the art results for cross-lingual Natural Language Inference. This result is useful, since most languages in the world are under-resourced and the improvement on cross-lingual transfer allows the internationalization of NLP models. This results open the window to use this algorithm in other real-world hierarchical datasets.",0
"In recent years, meta learning has emerged as a powerful tool for improving the performance of machine learning models by enabling them to learn from few data points or even one example. Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) is a popular method that uses gradients computed over multiple tasks to achieve fast adaptation to new tasks. However, most prior work on MAML has focused on problems where the input space is continuous and high dimensional. This paper proposes a novel approach called ""Meta-learning with MAML on Trees"" which extends the use of MAML to tree structured domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Our method leverages the structure present in these problems to design more effective gradient updates that significantly improve performance compared to existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it can consistently outperform state-of-the art baselines across a wide range of tasks. Overall, our results highlight the potential of using meta-learning with MAML on trees for solving complex real world problems with minimal training data.",1
"The classification accuracy of deep learning models depends not only on the size of their training sets, but also on the quality of their labels. In medical image classification, large-scale datasets are becoming abundant, but their labels will be noisy when they are automatically extracted from radiology reports using natural language processing tools. Given that deep learning models can easily overfit these noisy-label samples, it is important to study training approaches that can handle label noise. In this paper, we adapt a state-of-the-art (SOTA) noisy-label multi-class training approach to learn a multi-label classifier for the dataset Chest X-ray14, which is a large scale dataset known to contain label noise in the training set. Given that this dataset also has label noise in the testing set, we propose a new theoretically sound method to estimate the performance of the model on a hidden clean testing data, given the result on the noisy testing data. Using our clean data performance estimation, we notice that the majority of label noise on Chest X-ray14 is present in the class 'No Finding', which is intuitively correct because this is the most likely class to contain one or more of the 14 diseases due to labelling mistakes.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis by providing unprecedented performance across many tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. A key bottleneck in training these models is obtaining high quality labeled data, which can be prohibitively expensive and time consuming to obtain. One approach to mitigate the label scarcity problem is through weakly supervised methods that leverage additional sources of information beyond fully annotated images to train classifiers. However, these approaches often assume the availability of large amounts of partially labeled data, which may not always be realistic. In this work, we propose NoisyLabelLearning (NLL), a new algorithm for large scale medical image classification in the setting where only small numbers of examples have been manually annotated. NLL combines semi-supervised learning techniques, including noise contrastive estimation and pseudo-label generation, allowing us to generate synthetic annotations from other modalities like CT scans, MRIs, or pathology reports. We then use existing deep learning architectures to learn a joint embedding space between these modality views using a triplet loss. Finally, we use our generated labels to fine tune classifiers on large datasets with very few manual annotations. By evaluating our method on multiple benchmarks including breast cancer histopathological image classification and chest xray pneumonia classification, we show state-of-the art results significantly outperforming previous semi-supervised methods. Our codebase is open source and freely available online.",1
"The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the most popular and most studied combinatorial problem, starting with von Neumann in 1951. It has driven the discovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes, branch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing. The last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where (graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial algorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better heuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is appealing because developing algorithms to tackle efficiently NP-hard problems may require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by nature. In this work, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer architecture originally developed for natural language processing to the combinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without TSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved performances over recent learned heuristics with an optimal gap of 0.004% for TSP50 and 0.39% for TSP100.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning algorithms to solve optimization problems traditionally tackled by exact methods, such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP). This work presents a new approach that utilizes the transformer network architecture, which has achieved state-of-the-art results on natural language processing tasks, to find near-optimal solutions for TSP instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that it can outperform existing machine learning based approaches while competitively matching the performance of proven exact algorithms. Our study shows promise for future research into applying neural networks to solve complex combinatorial optimizations tasks.",1
"Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an extremely stimulating and challenging research area where Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processig (NLP) have recently met. In image captioning and video summarization, the semantic information is completely contained in still images or video dynamics, and it has only to be mined and expressed in a human-consistent way. Differently from this, in VQA semantic information in the same media must be compared with the semantics implied by a question expressed in natural language, doubling the artificial intelligence-related effort. Some recent surveys about VQA approaches have focused on methods underlying either the image-related processing or the verbal-related one, or on the way to consistently fuse the conveyed information. Possible applications are only suggested, and, in fact, most cited works rely on general-purpose datasets that are used to assess the building blocks of a VQA system. This paper rather considers the proposals that focus on real-world applications, possibly using as benchmarks suitable data bound to the application domain. The paper also reports about some recent challenges in VQA research.",0
"In this study, we examine how visual question answering (VQA) can be used across different domains. We present multiple experiments that demonstrate VQA’s effectiveness in tasks such as image retrieval, caption generation, and machine translation. Our results show that using VQA consistently leads to improved performance over baseline models. Additionally, we find that VQA achieves state-of-the art accuracy on several challenging datasets. Finally, we conclude by discussing potential future directions for research in VQA. Overall, our work highlights the promise of using VQA for natural language processing and computer vision tasks.",1
"We tackle the problem of producing compact models, maximizing their accuracy for a given model size. A standard solution is to train networks with Quantization Aware Training, where the weights are quantized during training and the gradients approximated with the Straight-Through Estimator. In this paper, we extend this approach to work beyond int8 fixed-point quantization with extreme compression methods where the approximations introduced by STE are severe, such as Product Quantization. Our proposal is to only quantize a different random subset of weights during each forward, allowing for unbiased gradients to flow through the other weights. Controlling the amount of noise and its form allows for extreme compression rates while maintaining the performance of the original model. As a result we establish new state-of-the-art compromises between accuracy and model size both in natural language processing and image classification. For example, applying our method to state-of-the-art Transformer and ConvNet architectures, we can achieve 82.5% accuracy on MNLI by compressing RoBERTa to 14MB and 80.0 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by compressing an EfficientNet-B3 to 3.3MB.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has achieved significant successes across many fields due to advances in computing power and data availability. Despite these achievements, deep learning models often require large amounts of computational resources and memory, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices such as smartphones, drones, and embedded systems. To address this issue, model compression techniques have been developed to reduce the size of deep learning models while maintaining their accuracy. One approach to model compression is quantization, which replaces floating point weights with integers during training and inference. However, using quantized gradients can lead to severe degradation in model performance due to noise introduced by the quantization process. This study explores methods to mitigate the negative effects of quantization noise on the training of neural networks, allowing for more extreme levels of model compression without sacrificing accuracy. Our results show that incorporating regularization into the training process and adjusting hyperparameters such as batch size can significantly improve the stability and generalization ability of quantized models, even under high levels of compression. These findings suggest new directions for developing efficient machine learning algorithms that can operate effectively on limited hardware resources.",1
"State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.",0
"This study presents a new approach for learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision. By leveraging large amounts of textual data that describe images, we can train artificial intelligence systems to generate high-quality image predictions based on verbal descriptions alone. Our method uses deep learning techniques and can be applied to a wide range of tasks related to computer vision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through comprehensive experiments and show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several benchmark datasets. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward in enabling computers to learn about the world through natural language, paving the way for exciting applications such as image generation and question answering.",1

"Here's a possible abstract:  The performance of machine learning models on mobile devices has become increasingly important as more users rely on their smartphones for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and other data-driven applications.

"Sign language is the primary language for people with a hearing loss. Sign language recognition (SLR) is the automatic recognition of sign language, which represents a challenging problem for computers, though some progress has been made recently using deep learning. Huge amounts of data are generally required to train deep learning models. However, corresponding datasets are missing for the majority of sign languages. Transfer learning is a technique to utilize a related task with an abundance of data available to help solve a target task lacking sufficient data. Transfer learning has been applied highly successfully in computer vision and natural language processing. However, much less research has been conducted in the field of SLR. This paper investigates how effectively transfer learning can be applied to isolated SLR using an inflated 3D convolutional neural network as the deep learning architecture. Transfer learning is implemented by pre-training a network on the American Sign Language dataset MS-ASL and subsequently fine-tuning it separately on three different sizes of the German Sign Language dataset SIGNUM. The results of the experiments give clear empirical evidence that transfer learning can be effectively applied to isolated SLR. The accuracy performances of the networks applying transfer learning increased substantially by up to 21% as compared to the baseline models that were not pre-trained on the MS-ASL dataset.",0
"This study proposes to use transfer learning on a pretrained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for sign language recognition by inflating the bottleneck layer features into a larger representation space. We aim to leverage the knowledge from large datasets such as ImageNet and fine tune our model to recognize American Sign Language signs accurately. Our method uses two sets of data: one set to extract feature representations and another smaller set to finetune the weights of the fully connected layers. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset. Additionally, we compare the performance of different CNN models that have been trained on either 2D images or depth maps extracted from videos, showing that using depth maps leads to better results. Finally, we visualize the activation maps of the inflated CNN model to show that it learns meaningful features relevant to sign language. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of using transfer learning and inflation techniques in enhancing CNNs for sign language recognition tasks.",1
"Large scale recommender models find most relevant items from huge catalogs, and they play a critical role in modern search and recommendation systems. To model the input space with large-vocab categorical features, a typical recommender model learns a joint embedding space through neural networks for both queries and items from user feedback data. However, with millions to billions of items in the corpus, users tend to provide feedback for a very small set of them, causing a power-law distribution. This makes the feedback data for long-tail items extremely sparse.   Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised representation learning research in both computer vision and natural language understanding, we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for large-scale item recommendations. The framework is designed to tackle the label sparsity problem by learning better latent relationship of item features. Specifically, SSL improves item representation learning as well as serving as additional regularization to improve generalization. Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation method that utilizes feature correlations within the proposed framework.   We evaluate our framework using two real-world datasets with 500M and 1B training examples respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSL regularization and show its superior performance over the state-of-the-art regularization techniques. We also have already launched the proposed techniques to a web-scale commercial app-to-app recommendation system, with significant improvements top-tier business metrics demonstrated in A/B experiments on live traffic. Our online results also verify our hypothesis that our framework indeed improves model performance even more on slices that lack supervision.",0
"This paper presents a self-supervised learning method called Pairwise Dependency Embedding (PDE) which can learn item representations without explicit feedback signals by leveraging pairwise relationships among items. By casting the task as a dimensionality reduction problem on item pairs, we propose PDE that jointly models item co-occurrences with user behavior data under a unified framework. Comprehensive experiments on large scale real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach against several strong baselines. In addition, we present extensive analyses over different dimensions and discuss implications on recommender systems design beyond accuracy gain. Finally, we believe our work opens up exciting future directions for efficient and accurate recommendations under limited supervision scenarios in emerging applications such as conversational recommendation and personalized search.",1
"Product embeddings have been heavily investigated in the past few years, serving as the cornerstone for a broad range of machine learning applications in e-commerce. Despite the empirical success of product embeddings, little is known on how and why they work from the theoretical standpoint. Analogous results from the natural language processing (NLP) often rely on domain-specific properties that are not transferable to the e-commerce setting, and the downstream tasks often focus on different aspects of the embeddings. We take an e-commerce-oriented view of the product embeddings and reveal a complete theoretical view from both the representation learning and the learning theory perspective. We prove that product embeddings trained by the widely-adopted skip-gram negative sampling algorithm and its variants are sufficient dimension reduction regarding a critical product relatedness measure. The generalization performance in the downstream machine learning task is controlled by the alignment between the embeddings and the product relatedness measure. Following the theoretical discoveries, we conduct exploratory experiments that supports our theoretical insights for the product embeddings.",0
"Abstract This is a sample of a theoretical understanding of product embedding for e-commerce machine learning that could serve as the foundation for developing better product recommendations, search results, product discovery tools, visual design elements, or even chatbots for customer service. With advances in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), researchers can uncover important relationships among products without relying on explicit keywords. By utilizing distributed representations, these algorithms capture fine-grained connections across diverse dimensions like text descriptions, categories, images, brands, prices, etc., allowing for accurate predictive modeling and personalized suggestions. Incorporating knowledge graph embeddings further enhances performance by providing structured contexts around entities and their attributes. Ultimately, identifying the optimal combination of features and models requires experimentation, which can benefit from domain-specific expertise from data engineers who collaborate with experts in ML development. To enable reproducibility and facilitate collaboration, open source libraries and pipelines become essential components of successful product embedding workflows. Overall, building effective recommendation systems warrants a synergy between NLP, computer vision, knowledge graphs, and machine learning, with continuous refinement through empirical evaluation against user feedback metrics.

"Weaknesses in computer systems such as faults, bugs and errors in the architecture, design or implementation of software provide vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security of a system. Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) are a hierarchically designed dictionary of software weaknesses that provide a means to understand software flaws, potential impact of their exploitation, and means to mitigate these flaws. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are brief low-level descriptions that uniquely identify vulnerabilities in a specific product or protocol. Classifying or mapping of CVEs to CWEs provides a means to understand the impact and mitigate the vulnerabilities. Since manual mapping of CVEs is not a viable option, automated approaches are desirable but challenging.   We present a novel Transformer-based learning framework (V2W-BERT) in this paper. By using ideas from natural language processing, link prediction and transfer learning, our method outperforms previous approaches not only for CWE instances with abundant data to train, but also rare CWE classes with little or no data to train. Our approach also shows significant improvements in using historical data to predict links for future instances of CVEs, and therefore, provides a viable approach for practical applications. Using data from MITRE and National Vulnerability Database, we achieve up to 97% prediction accuracy for randomly partitioned data and up to 94% prediction accuracy in temporally partitioned data. We believe that our work will influence the design of better methods and training models, as well as applications to solve increasingly harder problems in cybersecurity.",0
"Title: An Abstract for ""V2W-BERT: A Framework for Effective Hierarchical Multiclass Classification of Software Vulnerabilities""  Effectively classifying software vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining secure systems. However, traditional approaches have limitations that hinder their effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose V2W-BERT, a framework designed for hierarchical multiclass classification of software vulnerabilities. We present evidence from our experiments using standard datasets, demonstrating the superiority of V2W-BERT over state-of-the-art methods. Our novel approach utilizes pre-trained transformer models to encode textual representations of vulnerability reports, enabling better understanding of complex dependencies among classes. Furthermore, we incorporate a hierarchy into the model by predicting higher-level labels first, reducing the search space for lower-level predictions. In summary, V2W-BERT offers significant improvements to the field of software vulnerability classification, with promising applications in real-world settings.",1
"Semantic embeddings have advanced the state of the art for countless natural language processing tasks, and various extensions to multimodal domains, such as visual-semantic embeddings, have been proposed. While the power of visual-semantic embeddings comes from the distillation and enrichment of information through machine learning, their inner workings are poorly understood and there is a shortage of analysis tools. To address this problem, we generalize the notion of probing tasks to the visual-semantic case. To this end, we (i) discuss the formalization of probing tasks for embeddings of image-caption pairs, (ii) define three concrete probing tasks within our general framework, (iii) train classifiers to probe for those properties, and (iv) compare various state-of-the-art embeddings under the lens of the proposed probing tasks. Our experiments reveal an up to 12% increase in accuracy on visual-semantic embeddings compared to the corresponding unimodal embeddings, which suggest that the text and image dimensions represented in the former do complement each other.",0
"""Probing Multimodal Embeddings for Linguistic Properties"" investigates the effectiveness of multimodal embeddings in capturing linguistic properties such as syntax, semantics, sentiment analysis, and other related tasks. In particular, we focus on visual-semantic representations which have gained popularity due to their ability to encode both textual and visual features into a single vector space. Our work presents empirical studies that assess the performance of these models on a range of NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks and showcases how they can provide significant improvements over traditional techniques. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by evaluating the quality of generated semantic outputs using human annotations and automated metrics. By providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, we aim to further push research towards developing more accurate and efficient ways of combining multiple modalities to enhance language understanding.",1
"Transformer is a ubiquitous model for natural language processing and has attracted wide attentions in computer vision. The attention maps are indispensable for a transformer model to encode the dependencies among input tokens. However, they are learned independently in each layer and sometimes fail to capture precise patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic mechanism based on evolving attention to improve the performance of transformers. On one hand, the attention maps in different layers share common knowledge, thus the ones in preceding layers can instruct the attention in succeeding layers through residual connections. On the other hand, low-level and high-level attentions vary in the level of abstraction, so we adopt convolutional layers to model the evolutionary process of attention maps. The proposed evolving attention mechanism achieves significant performance improvement over various state-of-the-art models for multiple tasks, including image classification, natural language understanding and machine translation.",0
"Recent advances in computer vision have led to significant improvements in image classification accuracy through convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, these models typically process images sequentially, from left to right and top to bottom, which can lead to suboptimal feature extraction and slow inference speeds. In order to address these issues, we propose a new architecture that combines residual connections with attention mechanisms, allowing the network to selectively focus on important regions of the input image. Our approach is based on the idea that certain features may be more informative than others, and by learning to attend to those features the model can improve its performance without increasing complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several challenging benchmark datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing more efficient and effective visual recognition systems.",1
"This paper attacks the challenging problem of video retrieval by text. In such a retrieval paradigm, an end user searches for unlabeled videos by ad-hoc queries described exclusively in the form of a natural-language sentence, with no visual example provided. Given videos as sequences of frames and queries as sequences of words, an effective sequence-to-sequence cross-modal matching is crucial. To that end, the two modalities need to be first encoded into real-valued vectors and then projected into a common space. In this paper we achieve this by proposing a dual deep encoding network that encodes videos and queries into powerful dense representations of their own. Our novelty is two-fold. First, different from prior art that resorts to a specific single-level encoder, the proposed network performs multi-level encoding that represents the rich content of both modalities in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Second, different from a conventional common space learning algorithm which is either concept based or latent space based, we introduce hybrid space learning which combines the high performance of the latent space and the good interpretability of the concept space. Dual encoding is conceptually simple, practically effective and end-to-end trained with hybrid space learning. Extensive experiments on four challenging video datasets show the viability of the new method.",0
"This paper introduces dual encoding video retrieval by text, which leverages both audio-visual features (AV) and image-text embedding (ITE). Dual encoding combines AV-features derived from video frames and ITE-embeddings obtained via Vision-Language models trained on vast amounts of Internet data. We argue that using two distinct modalities improves search quality over prior state-of-the-art methods. Our approach enhances performance compared to previous work across all metrics: mAP@Rank20 increases by more than 7 points; nDCG@Rank20 increases more than 0.4; while Recall@Rank20 and MAP@Rank10 increase roughly 6% points each. On average, dual encoding shows improvement of at least 9% compared to single modality baselines. These improvements demonstrate our method's efficacy as an innovative solution towards robust video retrieval using text queries.",1
"Statistical learning theory provides the foundation to applied machine learning, and its various successful applications in computer vision, natural language processing and other scientific domains. The theory, however, does not take into account the unique challenges of performing statistical learning in geospatial settings. For instance, it is well known that model errors cannot be assumed to be independent and identically distributed in geospatial (a.k.a. regionalized) variables due to spatial correlation; and trends caused by geophysical processes lead to covariate shifts between the domain where the model was trained and the domain where it will be applied, which in turn harm the use of classical learning methodologies that rely on random samples of the data. In this work, we introduce the geostatistical (transfer) learning problem, and illustrate the challenges of learning from geospatial data by assessing widely-used methods for estimating generalization error of learning models, under covariate shift and spatial correlation. Experiments with synthetic Gaussian process data as well as with real data from geophysical surveys in New Zealand indicate that none of the methods are adequate for model selection in a geospatial context. We provide general guidelines regarding the choice of these methods in practice while new methods are being actively researched.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, geostatistics has become increasingly important due to the exponential growth of location-based data generated by modern technologies such as GPS, satellite imagery, and remote sensing. This abundance of spatial data provides opportunities for advancing our understanding of natural phenomena and human behavior at different scales, from local to global. However, analyzing and interpreting these complex datasets pose significant challenges that require innovative solutions.  One promising approach towards addressing these difficulties is through machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning algorithms that can model nonlinear relationships among variables. These methods have been shown to improve predictions and generate insights into spatial processes, but their implementation faces several obstacles, including data quality issues, scale dependency, and computational limitations.  This review discusses the current state of geostatistical learning research, highlighting both the promises and pitfalls of using advanced statistical models in environmental science, urban planning, transportation management, epidemiology, and other domains where space matters. We argue that further development of effective geostatistical learning approaches requires integrating diverse disciplines to tackle interdisciplinary problems, strengthening collaboration across academic boundaries, and establishing open access to high-quality datasets to facilitate reproducibility and comparison. Our synthesis identifies future directions for methodological research and application perspectives, paving the way toward more informed decision making under uncertainty and limited information.

"We introduce QuerYD, a new large-scale dataset for retrieval and event localisation in video. A unique feature of our dataset is the availability of two audio tracks for each video: the original audio, and a high-quality spoken description of the visual content. The dataset is based on YouDescribe, a volunteer project that assists visually-impaired people by attaching voiced narrations to existing YouTube videos. This ever-growing collection of videos contains highly detailed, temporally aligned audio and text annotations. The content descriptions are more relevant than dialogue, and more detailed than previous description attempts, which can be observed to contain many superficial or uninformative descriptions. To demonstrate the utility of the QuerYD dataset, we show that it can be used to train and benchmark strong models for retrieval and event localisation. Data, code and models are made publicly available, and we hope that QuerYD inspires further research on video understanding with written and spoken natural language.",0
"Creating detailed datasets that contain both video data and corresponding textual annotations is essential for developing computer vision algorithms that can effectively process natural scenes. While several large-scale datasets have been released recently, there remains a shortage of high-quality resources featuring synchronized video and metadata, particularly those with strong attention paid to maintaining consistency between visual elements and their associated descriptions. To address this need, we introduce QuerYD, a novel video dataset containing over 20 hours of footage with meticulous text and audio narration tracks. Each clip features rich metadata describing camera movements, object identities, and scene events, enabling researchers to study these phenomena at scale while benefiting from precise correspondences across multiple modalities. In total, our resource contains more than 86,000 frames organized into 40 sequences capturing diverse real-world environments, including indoor spaces, outdoor scenes, and dynamic situations involving humans. Our work presents an important contribution to the community by providing a new benchmark to advance the state of art for multi-modal understanding tasks. We expect that QuerYD will serve as a valuable foundation for future endeavors exploring topics such as activity recognition, object detection, video description, and scene understanding.",1
"Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space. Specifically, ""fully-connected layers with Quaternions"" (4D hypercomplex numbers), which replace real-valued matrix multiplications in fully-connected layers with Hamilton products of Quaternions, both enjoy parameter savings with only 1/4 learnable parameters and achieve comparable performance in various applications. However, one key caveat is that hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and 16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex multiplications. To this end, we propose parameterizing hypercomplex multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary nD hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using arbitrarily $1/n$ learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer counterpart. Experiments of applications to the LSTM and Transformer models on natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and subject verb agreement demonstrate architectural flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to deep learning using hypercomplex multiplications with quaternions. We introduce a new parameterization method that allows for efficient training on large datasets while preserving important structural properties of the data. By utilizing a low-dimensional embedding of the quaternion group, we show how to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark tasks without sacrificing interpretability. Our work demonstrates the potential of quaternionic neural networks as a powerful tool for artificial intelligence applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing.",1
"The success of deep learning in the computer vision and natural language processing communities can be attributed to training of very deep neural networks with millions or billions of parameters which can then be trained with massive amounts of data. However, similar trend has largely eluded training of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where larger networks do not lead to performance improvement. Previous work has shown that this is mostly due to instability during training of deep RL agents when using larger networks. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand and address training of larger networks for deep RL. We first show that naively increasing network capacity does not improve performance. Then, we propose a novel method that consists of 1) wider networks with DenseNet connection, 2) decoupling representation learning from training of RL, 3) a distributed training method to mitigate overfitting problems. Using this three-fold technique, we show that we can train very large networks that result in significant performance gains. We present several ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and some intuitive understanding of the reasons for performance gain. We show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline algorithms on several challenging locomotion tasks.",0
"Abstract: Improving deep reinforcement learning algorithms for training larger neural networks remains a challenging problem due to their inherent complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we present new techniques that leverage recent advances in optimization methods and parallel computing to efficiently train large-scale deep reinforcement learning models. Our approach combines stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with second-order momentum factors and adaptive learning rate scheduling to achieve faster convergence rates without sacrificing accuracy. To further enhance scalability and efficiency, we implement our algorithm on GPUs using CUDA and distribute computation across multiple devices using synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD). Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark domains, including Atari games, Mujoco locomotion tasks, and Humanoid robotics simulations. Our proposed method paves the way for more advanced deep reinforcement learning applications with larger neural architectures and increased realism in simulation environments.",1
"Image Captioning is an arduous task of producing syntactically and semantically correct textual descriptions of an image in natural language with context related to the image. Existing notable pieces of research in Bengali Image Captioning (BIC) are based on encoder-decoder architecture. This paper presents an end-to-end image captioning system utilizing a multimodal architecture by combining a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to encode sequence information with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model image encoder for extracting region-based visual features. We investigate our approach's performance on the BanglaLekhaImageCaptions dataset using the existing evaluation metrics and perform a human evaluation for qualitative analysis. Experiments show that our approach's language encoder captures the fine-grained information in the caption, and combined with the image features, it generates accurate and diversified caption. Our work outperforms all the existing BIC works and achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by scoring 0.651 on BLUE-1, 0.572 on CIDEr, 0.297 on METEOR, 0.434 on ROUGE, and 0.357 on SPICE.",0
"In recent years, image caption generation has gained significant attention as a challenging task due to its potential applications in different domains such as assistive technology, education, entertainment, and more. However, most research focuses on English images and few attempts have been made towards other languages such as Bengali. This paper presents an improved methodology for generating descriptive and accurate captions for Bengali images using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Encoder-Decoder Model. Our approach employs pre-trained CNN models for feature extraction from input images, followed by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation tasks. Additionally, we introduce novel techniques such as data augmentation, attention mechanism, and adversarial training to enhance the performance of our system. We evaluate our proposed framework against existing methods on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms them significantly in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. Finally, we provide detailed analysis of the results and discuss future directions for improving Bengali image captioning further.",1
"Structured matrices, such as those derived from Kronecker products (KP), are effective at compressing neural networks, but can lead to unacceptable accuracy loss when applied to large models. In this paper, we propose the notion of doping -- addition of an extremely sparse matrix to a structured matrix. Doping facilitates additional degrees of freedom for a small number of parameters, allowing them to independently diverge from the fixed structure. To train LSTMs with doped structured matrices, we introduce the additional parameter matrix while slowly annealing its sparsity level. However, we find that performance degrades as we slowly sparsify the doping matrix, due to co-matrix adaptation (CMA) between the structured and the sparse matrices. We address this over dependence on the sparse matrix using a co-matrix dropout regularization (CMR) scheme. We provide empirical evidence to show that doping, CMA and CMR are concepts generally applicable to multiple structured matrices (Kronecker Product, LMF, Hybrid Matrix Decomposition). Additionally, results with doped kronecker product matrices demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy at large compression factors (10 - 25x) across 4 natural language processing applications with minor loss in accuracy. Doped KP compression technique outperforms previous state-of-the art compression results by achieving 1.3 - 2.4x higher compression factor at a similar accuracy, while also beating strong alternatives like pruning and low-rank methods by a large margin (8% or more). Additionally, we show that doped KP can be deployed on commodity hardware using the current software stack and achieve 2.5 - 5.5x inference run-time speed-up over baseline.",0
"Artificial neural networks have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their success in solving many challenges in natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, game playing, robotics, bioinformatics and other domains. In particular, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been proven effective and widely adopted as a state-of-the-art model architecture. However, training large scale neural network models can often take days or even weeks on powerful GPU clusters which makes them impractical for many applications. Furthermore, inference time in these models can affect latency sensitive tasks such as realtime text generation and machine translation. Consequently, there is growing interest in designing more efficient models that trade off some amount of accuracy for speed without significantly sacrificing performance. In this work, we introduce Doping; a novel model pruning technique that uses sparse structured additive matrices to compress deep LSTM architectures by selectively removing connections between neurons during training while still preserving model expressiveness. We show through extensive experimentation that our method results in significant reduction in parameters while only marginally impacting test set perplexity compared to the full unpruned model across multiple NLP benchmarks datasets such as Penn Treebank, BooksCorpus, and Movie Reviews. Our method achieves over 97% parameter savings while maintaining near baseline performance in most cases. Additionally, we analyze the effect of different hyperparameter choices such as sparsity thresholds, regularization terms, and matrix multiplicand selection criteria towards optimal model size reduction while minimizing loss in accuracy. Overall, our proposed approach represents an effec",1
"Analog electronic and optical computing exhibit tremendous advantages over digital computing for accelerating deep learning when operations are executed at low precision. In this work, we derive a relationship between analog precision, which is limited by noise, and digital bit precision. We propose extending analog computing architectures to support varying levels of precision by repeating operations and averaging the result, decreasing the impact of noise. Such architectures enable programmable tradeoffs between precision and other desirable performance metrics such as energy efficiency or throughput. To utilize dynamic precision, we propose a method for learning the precision of each layer of a pre-trained model without retraining network weights. We evaluate this method on analog architectures subject to a variety of noise sources such as shot noise, thermal noise, and weight noise and find that employing dynamic precision reduces energy consumption by up to 89% for computer vision models such as Resnet50 and by 24% for natural language processing models such as BERT. In one example, we apply dynamic precision to a shot-noise limited homodyne optical neural network and simulate inference at an optical energy consumption of 2.7 aJ/MAC for Resnet50 and 1.6 aJ/MAC for BERT with 2% accuracy degradation.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to precision analog computing for neural networks, which enables dynamic adjustment of precision based on network activity. Traditional neural networks use digital hardware that requires precise arithmetic operations at each layer of computation. However, these computations can consume significant power and cause delays due to limited bandwidth and serial processing. In contrast, our method leverages the parallelism and energy efficiency of analog circuits while maintaining high accuracy by dynamically controlling precision levels during inference. Our results show that, compared to state-of-the-art digital implementations, our proposed scheme achieves comparable accuracies with reduced latency and up to three orders of magnitude lower energy consumption. Additionally, we demonstrate how to integrate our method into commonly used deep learning frameworks without requiring modifications to existing models. Our work paves the way towards enabling more efficient and adaptive artificial intelligence systems that operate beyond the capabilities of current digital architectures.",1
"A pruning-based AutoML framework for run-time reconfigurability, namely RT3, is proposed in this work. This enables Transformer-based large Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to be efficiently executed on resource-constrained mobile devices and reconfigured (i.e., switching models for dynamic hardware conditions) at run-time. Such reconfigurability is the key to save energy for battery-powered mobile devices, which widely use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique for hardware reconfiguration to prolong battery life. In this work, we creatively explore a hybrid block-structured pruning (BP) and pattern pruning (PP) for Transformer-based models and first attempt to combine hardware and software reconfiguration to maximally save energy for battery-powered mobile devices. Specifically, RT3 integrates two-level optimizations: First, it utilizes an efficient BP as the first-step compression for resource-constrained mobile devices; then, RT3 heuristically generates a shrunken search space based on the first level optimization and searches multiple pattern sets with diverse sparsity for PP via reinforcement learning to support lightweight software reconfiguration, which corresponds to available frequency levels of DVFS (i.e., hardware reconfiguration). At run-time, RT3 can switch the lightweight pattern sets within 45ms to guarantee the required real-time constraint at different frequency levels. Results further show that RT3 can prolong battery life over 4x improvement with less than 1% accuracy loss for Transformer and 1.5% score decrease for DistilBERT.",0
"Here is a possible abstract:  With mobile devices becoming increasingly powerful, there is growing interest in enabling complex artificial intelligence (AI) models such as transformers on these devices. However, many popular deep learning frameworks are unable to take advantage of hardware acceleration due to their complexity, which limits performance gains. In addition, current approaches only consider offline execution and lack run-time reconfigurability, making them inflexible during deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called ""Dancing along Battery"" that enables efficient runtime configuration of transformer-based models using lightweight kernel primitives. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on mobile devices and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9x speedup while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our framework has potential applications across different domains including natural language processing and computer vision tasks, providing researchers and developers with greater flexibility in designing new AI systems optimized for battery life and computational constraints.",1
"The knowledge that data lies close to a particular submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space may be useful in a number of ways. For instance, one may want to automatically mark any point far away from the submanifold as an outlier, or to use its geodesic distance to measure similarity between points. Classical problems for manifold learning are often posed in a very high dimension, e.g. for spaces of images or spaces of representations of words. Today, with deep representation learning on the rise in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing, many problems of this kind may be transformed into problems of moderately high dimension, typically of the order of hundreds. Motivated by this, we propose a manifold learning technique suitable for moderately high dimension and large datasets. The manifold is learned from the training data in the form of an intersection of quadric hypersurfaces -- simple but expressive objects. At test time, this manifold can be used to introduce an outlier score for arbitrary new points and to improve a given similarity metric by incorporating learned geometric structure into it.",0
This paper presents a method for using quadric hypersurfaces to intersect manifolds in high dimensional spaces for the purpose of manifold learning. The approach leverages the properties of quadrics to construct low dimensional representations that preserve key features of the original data set. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting embedding captures important underlying structure while reducing noise. We discuss potential applications including computer vision and nonlinear dimension reduction. The work builds on prior research at the intersection of algebraic geometry and machine learning.,1
"Machine learning and deep learning have shown great promise in mobile sensing applications, including Human Activity Recognition. However, the performance of such models in real-world settings largely depends on the availability of large datasets that captures diverse behaviors. Recently, studies in computer vision and natural language processing have shown that leveraging massive amounts of unlabeled data enables performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised models.   In this work, we present SelfHAR, a semi-supervised model that effectively learns to leverage unlabeled mobile sensing datasets to complement small labeled datasets. Our approach combines teacher-student self-training, which distills the knowledge of unlabeled and labeled datasets while allowing for data augmentation, and multi-task self-supervision, which learns robust signal-level representations by predicting distorted versions of the input.   We evaluated SelfHAR on various HAR datasets and showed state-of-the-art performance over supervised and previous semi-supervised approaches, with up to 12% increase in F1 score using the same number of model parameters at inference. Furthermore, SelfHAR is data-efficient, reaching similar performance using up to 10 times less labeled data compared to supervised approaches. Our work not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in a diverse set of HAR datasets, but also sheds light on how pre-training tasks may affect downstream performance.",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two publicly available benchmarks and show that SelfHAR outperforms several state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly less labeled data. Our results suggest that self-training with unlabeled data could play an important role in building robust and efficient HAR systems.",1
"The count-min sketch (CMS) is a randomized data structure that provides estimates of tokens' frequencies in a large data stream using a compressed representation of the data by random hashing. In this paper, we rely on a recent Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) view on the CMS to develop a novel learning-augmented CMS under power-law data streams. We assume that tokens in the stream are drawn from an unknown discrete distribution, which is endowed with a normalized inverse Gaussian process (NIGP) prior. Then, using distributional properties of the NIGP, we compute the posterior distribution of a token's frequency in the stream, given the hashed data, and in turn corresponding BNP estimates. Applications to synthetic and real data show that our approach achieves a remarkable performance in the estimation of low-frequency tokens. This is known to be a desirable feature in the context of natural language processing, where it is indeed common in the context of the power-law behaviour of the data.",0
"This article presents a Bayesian nonparametric method for modeling count-min sketches (CMS) on high dimensional, streaming data. CMS is a popular algorithm used for estimating frequency moments over a massive database while reducing space complexity by several orders of magnitude. Traditional approaches assume that the underlying distribution follows a fixed parametric family like Poisson or zipfian, which may result in poor accuracy due to misspecification errors. In contrast, our proposed framework utilizes a nonparametric prior distribution using Chinese restaurant processes to allow for flexibility in accommodating heterogeneous datasets without assuming a specific shape. We show through extensive simulations that our method significantly outperforms existing methods across different scenarios and can adapt well to both sparse and dense data distributions, including power law models. Our results have significant implications in various applications where space efficiency is crucial, such as online advertising and network monitoring systems.",1
"Veracity is an essential key in research and development of innovative products. Live Emotion analysis and verification nullify deceit made to complainers on live chat, corroborate messages of both ends in messaging apps and promote an honest conversation between users. The main concept behind this emotion artificial intelligent verifier is to license or decline message accountability by comparing variegated emotions of chat app users recognized through facial expressions and text prediction. In this paper, a proposed emotion intelligent live detector acts as an honest arbiter who distributes facial emotions into labels namely, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, and Hate. Further, it separately predicts a label of messages through text classification. Finally, it compares both labels and declares the message as a fraud or a bonafide. For emotion detection, we deployed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a miniXception model and for text prediction, we selected Support Vector Machine (SVM) natural language processing probability classifier due to receiving the best accuracy on training dataset after applying Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Logistic regression.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to verifying user emotions through chat applications by utilizing machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. Our proposed system, called ""Lie-Sensor,"" uses emotional intelligence to detect deception in online communication, providing a more accurate assessment of users' true feelings compared to traditional methods such as questionnaires or facial analysis software. In addition to improving interpersonal communication in online platforms, our model can also serve as an effective tool for mental health monitoring and preventing cyberbullying. We describe the methodology used in designing our algorithm and provide experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying deceptive behavior in real-life scenarios. Overall, we believe that Lie-Sensor has great potential for enhancing the quality and authenticity of human interactions in digital environments.",1
"Transformers have shown outstanding results for natural language understanding and, more recently, for image classification. We here extend this work and propose a transformer-based approach for image retrieval: we adopt vision transformers for generating image descriptors and train the resulting model with a metric learning objective, which combines a contrastive loss with a differential entropy regularizer. Our results show consistent and significant improvements of transformers over convolution-based approaches. In particular, our method outperforms the state of the art on several public benchmarks for category-level retrieval, namely Stanford Online Product, In-Shop and CUB-200. Furthermore, our experiments on ROxford and RParis also show that, in comparable settings, transformers are competitive for particular object retrieval, especially in the regime of short vector representations and low-resolution images.",0
"Recent advances in transformer architectures have led to significant improvements in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. However, these models are often computationally expensive, which makes them difficult to apply to high resolution image data like photos. To address this issue, we propose training vision transformers (ViTs) specifically designed for large scale image retrieval applications that can effectively utilize both local and global information from images while maintaining efficient computational performance. Our ViT model achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets including COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context), Instagram, Landmarks, Flickr8K, and VGG dataset, outperforming popular convolutional neural network based approaches such as ResNet and DenseNet. Furthermore, our approach provides efficient implementation details, making it feasible to deploy ViT systems at scale. Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of vision transformers for large-scale image retrieval applications.",1
"We address the problem of learning on sets of features, motivated by the need of performing pooling operations in long biological sequences of varying sizes, with long-range dependencies, and possibly few labeled data. To address this challenging task, we introduce a parametrized representation of fixed size, which embeds and then aggregates elements from a given input set according to the optimal transport plan between the set and a trainable reference. Our approach scales to large datasets and allows end-to-end training of the reference, while also providing a simple unsupervised learning mechanism with small computational cost. Our aggregation technique admits two useful interpretations: it may be seen as a mechanism related to attention layers in neural networks, or it may be seen as a scalable surrogate of a classical optimal transport-based kernel. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on biological sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results for protein fold recognition and detection of chromatin profiles tasks, and, as a proof of concept, we show promising results for processing natural language sequences. We provide an open-source implementation of our embedding that can be used alone or as a module in larger learning models at https://github.com/claying/OTK.",0
"In recent years, transport embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, most existing transport embedding methods are limited by their reliance on simple metrics like Euclidean distance, which can fail to capture complex relationships between images. This study proposes a novel approach called trainable optimal transport (OT) embedding that addresses these limitations. Our method introduces learnable variables into OT planning, allowing us to optimize more effectively over both space and time. We demonstrate our approach using a feature aggregation task where two images must be aligned based on a learned correspondence between their features. With minimal modification, we show that our formulation closely approximates attention mechanisms commonly used in deep learning models. Our experiments highlight the superiority of our approach compared to popular baselines across several benchmark datasets for both feature aggregation and attention-related tasks. Overall, we provide compelling evidence of the effectiveness and versatility of trainable OT embeddings in computer vision.",1
"We consider the problem of referring segmentation in images and videos with natural language. Given an input image (or video) and a referring expression, the goal is to segment the entity referred by the expression in the image or video. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal self-attention (CMSA) module to utilize fine details of individual words and the input image or video, which effectively captures the long-range dependencies between linguistic and visual features. Our model can adaptively focus on informative words in the referring expression and important regions in the visual input. We further propose a gated multi-level fusion (GMLF) module to selectively integrate self-attentive cross-modal features corresponding to different levels of visual features. This module controls the feature fusion of information flow of features at different levels with high-level and low-level semantic information related to different attentive words. Besides, we introduce cross-frame self-attention (CFSA) module to effectively integrate temporal information in consecutive frames which extends our method in the case of referring segmentation in videos. Experiments on benchmark datasets of four referring image datasets and two actor and action video segmentation datasets consistently demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In recent years, referring expression (REF) segmentation has become an important task in computer vision, with applications ranging from image and video retrieval to natural language processing. Existing approaches rely on visual features alone, without taking into account cross-modal relationships between textual descriptions and image content. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach that uses cross-modal self-attention networks (CSAMs). CSAMs enable us to effectively capture the relationship between REF segments and their corresponding textual descriptions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We believe that CSAMs have great potential for a wide range of problems involving multi-modal data.",1
"In the last decades, extreme classification has become an essential topic for deep learning. It has achieved great success in many areas, especially in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). However, it is very challenging to train a deep model with millions of classes due to the memory and computation explosion in the last output layer. In this paper, we propose a large-scale training system to address these challenges. First, we build a hybrid parallel training framework to make the training process feasible. Second, we propose a novel softmax variation named KNN softmax, which reduces both the GPU memory consumption and computation costs and improves the throughput of training. Then, to eliminate the communication overhead, we propose a new overlapping pipeline and a gradient sparsification method. Furthermore, we design a fast continuous convergence strategy to reduce total training iterations by adaptively adjusting learning rate and updating model parameters. With the help of all the proposed methods, we gain 3.9$\times$ throughput of our training system and reduce almost 60\% of training iterations. The experimental results show that using an in-house 256 GPUs cluster, we could train a classifier of 100 million classes on Alibaba Retail Product Dataset in about five days while achieving a comparable accuracy with the naive softmax training process.",0
"Abstract: We present a large-scale training system capable of handling extremely high dimensionality datasets with up to billions of features and millions of examples while achieving state-of-the art accuracy and speed. Our method leverages distributed computing across hundreds of GPUs and innovative use of tensor processing units (TPUs). To handle such high dimensional datasets, we first apply principle component analysis (PCA) to compress features into low dimensions while minimizing loss. We then apply stochastic gradient descent (SGD), momentum SGD, and Adam optimizers to train highly accurate models rapidly on our system which can scale linearly as more data becomes available. Compared against other methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy in less time than comparable systems on common benchmark datasets. This allows us to perform classification tasks that previously would have been impractical on current hardware. With these advances in place, we successfully demonstrate our framework on large-scale image recognition using ALIBLABA’s massive dataset consisting of one hundred million images from three popular Chinese online shopping sites, TMall, Taobao, Jingdongmall etc.. Overall our method can reduce risk of overfitting by tuning hyperparameters on validation set during training, and achieve good scalability with respect to growing volume of images. Furthermore, we hope that our open source implementation of our algorithm can serve as a model for others looking to solve problems similar to those faced by AliBabba.com, allowing them to rapidly iterate new ideas at scale and deliver value to customers faster than ever before.

"Deep learning-based models have been very successful in achieving state-of-the-art results in many of the computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing tasks in the last few years. These models seem a natural fit for handling the ever-increasing scale of biometric recognition problems, from cellphone authentication to airport security systems. Deep learning-based models have increasingly been leveraged to improve the accuracy of different biometric recognition systems in recent years. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of more than 120 promising works on biometric recognition (including face, fingerprint, iris, palmprint, ear, voice, signature, and gait recognition), which deploy deep learning models, and show their strengths and potentials in different applications. For each biometric, we first introduce the available datasets that are widely used in the literature and their characteristics. We will then talk about several promising deep learning works developed for that biometric, and show their performance on popular public benchmarks. We will also discuss some of the main challenges while using these models for biometric recognition, and possible future directions to which research in this area is headed.",0
"Modern security systems rely heavily on biometric recognition methods to ensure that only authorized users can access certain facilities. However, traditional methods such as fingerprinting have several drawbacks including high error rates during identification, storage capacity limitations, and difficulty capturing minutiae details from certain materials. To overcome these problems, researchers began exploring deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of biometric recognition systems. This survey provides an overview of current trends in biometrics using deep learning. The first part discusses different types of biometric data, including facial features, hand geometry, voice patterns, iris scanning, gait analysis, and others. The second part describes popular deep learning architectures used in bio-metric applications such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), graph neural networks (GNN) and so forth. We focus on how deep learning has impacted three important aspects of biometric recognition systems: feature extraction, classification, and quality control. We explain each aspect’s importance in detail and provide examples of recent studies conducted by prominent research groups in academia or industry. Finally, we conclude our study by analyzing the benefits and challenges brought by incorporating artificial intelligence into biometric verification processes and suggest potential future directions in advancing this growing field. By reviewing representative literature from international journals, conference proceedings, books, technical reports and online repositories, this comprehensive report highlights emerging issues regarding the adoption of advanced technology in biometric authentication scenarios.

"The count-min sketch (CMS) is a time and memory efficient randomized data structure that provides estimates of tokens' frequencies in a data stream, i.e. point queries, based on random hashed data. Learning-augmented CMSs improve the CMS by learning models that allow to better exploit data properties. In this paper, we focus on the learning-augmented CMS of Cai, Mitzenmacher and Adams (\textit{NeurIPS} 2018), which relies on Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) modeling of a data stream via Dirichlet process (DP) priors. This is referred to as the CMS-DP, and it leads to BNP estimates of a point query as posterior means of the point query given the hashed data. While BNPs is proved to be a powerful tool for developing robust learning-augmented CMSs, ideas and methods behind the CMS-DP are tailored to point queries under DP priors, and they can not be used for other priors or more general queries. In this paper, we present an alternative, and more flexible, derivation of the CMS-DP such that: i) it allows to make use of the Pitman-Yor process (PYP) prior, which is arguably the most popular generalization of the DP prior; ii) it can be readily applied to the more general problem of estimating range queries. This leads to develop a novel learning-augmented CMS under power-law data streams, referred to as the CMS-PYP, which relies on BNP modeling of the stream via PYP priors. Applications to synthetic and real data show that the CMS-PYP outperforms the CMS and the CMS-DP in the estimation of low-frequency tokens; this known to be a critical feature in natural language processing, where it is indeed common to encounter power-law data streams.",0
"""Learning-Augmented Count-Min Sketches Via Bayesian Nonparametrics"" presents a new approach to improving count-min sketches by incorporating machine learning techniques into their design. Count-min sketches are data structures that can estimate set membership probabilities quickly and accurately, making them valuable tools in many applications such as streaming algorithms and data analytics. However, they have limitations due to the fixed sizes of their hash tables, which may result in overestimation or underestimation of certain probabilities. To address these issues, we propose using Bayesian nonparametric methods to adaptively learn the optimal table sizes based on the incoming data stream. Our method uses a hierarchical prior distribution over the learned sizes, allowing us to capture uncertainty in our estimates while providing robustness against outliers. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution significantly reduces error rates compared to traditional count-min sketches, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets or varying data distributions. Overall, this work highlights the potential benefits of combining classical computer science techniques with modern machine learning approaches.",1
"Unsupervised representation learning techniques, such as learning word embeddings, have had a significant impact on the field of natural language processing. Similar representation learning techniques have not yet become commonplace in the context of 3D vision. This, despite the fact that the physical 3D spaces have a similar semantic structure to bodies of text: words are surrounded by words that are semantically related, just like objects are surrounded by other objects that are similar in concept and usage.   In this work, we exploit this structure in learning semantically meaningful low dimensional vector representations of objects. We learn these vector representations by mining a dataset of scanned 3D spaces using an unsupervised algorithm. We represent objects as point clouds, a flexible and general representation for 3D data, which we encode into a vector representation. We show that using our method to include context increases the ability of a clustering algorithm to distinguish different semantic classes from each other. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm produces continuous and meaningful object embeddings through interpolation experiments.",0
"Here is a possible abstract:  Unsupervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting features from raw data, enabling computers to learn complex representations without human supervision. In particular, deep learning methods such as autoencoders have shown great promise in feature learning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on many challenging problems. However, these successes primarily concern image and video datasets, while less attention has been paid to point clouds, which represent another important type of high-dimensional input data. This gap motivates our work on unsupervised object-level feature learning for point cloud inputs. Our method, called Points2Vec, applies classical techniques from computer vision and machine learning in order to obtain robust, interpretable features that capture spatial structure and correspondences across multiple objects. We evaluate our approach using both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing meaningful representations that can serve as input to downstream machine learning models. Overall, Points2Vec represents a promising contribution towards advancing the science of unsupervised representation learning for real-world applications involving point cloud data.  Please note that I am only able to provide you one possible example of a good abstract if there is any problem please tell me I will fix it right away",1
"Graph neural networks are emerging as continuation of deep learning success w.r.t. graph data. Tens of different graph neural network variants have been proposed, most following a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the node features are updated via aggregating features of its neighboring nodes from layer to layer. Though related research surges, the power of GNNs are still not on-par-with their counterpart CNNs in computer vision and RNNs in natural language processing. We rethink this problem from the perspective of information propagation, and propose to enhance information propagation among GNN layers by combining heterogeneous aggregations. We argue that as richer information are propagated from shallow to deep layers, the discriminative capability of features formulated by GNN can benefit from it. As our first attempt in this direction, a new generic GNN layer formulation and upon this a new GNN variant referred as HAG-Net is proposed. We empirically validate the effectiveness of HAG-Net on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and elaborate all the design options and criterions along with.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex relationships and patterns within large datasets. However, one limitation of GNNs is their reliance on homogeneous aggregation methods, which can lead to suboptimal performance in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that utilizes heterogeneous aggregation techniques to enhance information propagation in GNNs. Our method enables GNNs to learn more diverse representations of data nodes and capture unique characteristics of different edge types, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness. We evaluate our technique using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments. Our results show significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches, validating the potential of our proposed method for enhancing GNN performance. Overall, our work contributes new insights into the design and operation of GNN architectures, paving the way for future research in this exciting field.",1
"Self-supervised learning has gained popularity because of its ability to avoid the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. It is capable of adopting self-defined pseudo labels as supervision and use the learned representations for several downstream tasks. Specifically, contrastive learning has recently become a dominant component in self-supervised learning methods for computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and other domains. It aims at embedding augmented versions of the same sample close to each other while trying to push away embeddings from different samples. This paper provides an extensive review of self-supervised methods that follow the contrastive approach. The work explains commonly used pretext tasks in a contrastive learning setup, followed by different architectures that have been proposed so far. Next, we have a performance comparison of different methods for multiple downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, and action recognition. Finally, we conclude with the limitations of the current methods and the need for further techniques and future directions to make substantial progress.",0
"This survey presents a comprehensive overview of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL), a rapidly growing subfield within machine learning that has emerged as one of the most promising techniques for unlocking the full potential of deep neural networks. SSL involves training artificial intelligence models by presenting them with two different representations of the same data point and asking them to predict whether the two samples belong to the same class or not. By taking advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data and exploiting the intrinsic structure of the data distribution, SSL can improve model performance across a variety of tasks while requiring significantly less labeled data compared to traditional supervised learning approaches. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamental concepts behind SSL and provide an analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. We then explore several representative SSL methods and architectures and discuss their applications in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, robotics, reinforcement learning, and other areas. Additionally, we examine several open challenges faced by researchers working in SSL, including stability issues, negative sample quality, and scalability bottlenecks, among others. Finally, we conclude with future directions for research in SSL and highlight some of the exciting opportunities for applying SSL beyond deep learning. Overall, our goal is to provide readers with a solid foundation for understanding and implementing SSL in practice and inspire further innovation in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"The parameters of a neural network are naturally organized in groups, some of which might not contribute to its overall performance. To prune out unimportant groups of parameters, we can include some non-differentiable penalty to the objective function, and minimize it using proximal gradient methods. In this paper, we derive the weighted proximal operator, which is a necessary component of these proximal methods, of two structured sparsity inducing penalties. Moreover, they can be approximated efficiently with a numerical solver, and despite this approximation, we prove that existing convergence guarantees are preserved when these operators are integrated as part of a generic adaptive proximal method. Finally, we show that this adaptive method, together with the weighted proximal operators derived here, is indeed capable of finding solutions with structure in their sparsity patterns, on representative examples from computer vision and natural language processing.",0
"One approach to improving performance in deep learning models is through structured sparsity inducing adaptive optimizers. These techniques aim to reduce model complexity by selectively pruning neurons that have little effect on the output, while retaining those that contribute most significantly. This can lead to better generalization ability and faster training times. In recent years, several such methods have been proposed, including dropout regularization, Lasso regression, and neural network pruning. Despite their successes, these approaches suffer from limitations such as high computational cost, lack of scalability, and limited applicability across different architectures and datasets. To address these issues, we propose a new method called SSAO (Structured Sparsity Inducing Adaptive Optimizer), which utilizes a biologically inspired mechanism to achieve structured sparsity without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate our method on a range of benchmark tasks and demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results show that SSAO achieves significant reduction in model size with minimal loss in accuracy, making it a promising tool for deep learning researchers seeking improved efficiency in both time and resources.",1
"Predicting motion of surrounding agents is critical to real-world applications of tactical path planning for autonomous driving. Due to the complex temporal dependencies and social interactions of agents, on-line trajectory prediction is a challenging task. With the development of attention mechanism in recent years, transformer model has been applied in natural language sequence processing first and then image processing. In this paper, we present a Spatial-Channel Transformer Network for trajectory prediction with attention functions. Instead of RNN models, we employ transformer model to capture the spatial-temporal features of agents. A channel-wise module is inserted to measure the social interaction between agents. We find that the Spatial-Channel Transformer Network achieves promising results on real-world trajectory prediction datasets on the traffic scenes.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for trajectory prediction using the spatial transformer network (STN) architecture. The authors propose to apply the STN framework directly to traffic scenes by considering all detected objects as individual instances to predict their future locations. The proposed method utilizes both RGB image data and trajectories from multiple previous frames to enhance accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted on real-world datasets showing that the STN outperforms traditional methods such as social force models and convolutional neural networks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying STNs to trajectory prediction tasks on traffic scenarios.

"Deep learning has shown its power in many applications, including object detection in images, natural-language understanding, and speech recognition. To make it more accessible to end users, many deep learning models are now embedded in mobile apps. Compared to offloading deep learning from smartphones to the cloud, performing machine learning on-device can help improve latency, connectivity, and power consumption. However, most deep learning models within Android apps can easily be obtained via mature reverse engineering, while the models' exposure may invite adversarial attacks. In this study, we propose a simple but effective approach to hacking deep learning models using adversarial attacks by identifying highly similar pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. All 10 real-world Android apps in the experiment are successfully attacked by our approach. Apart from the feasibility of the model attack, we also carry out an empirical study that investigates the characteristics of deep learning models used by hundreds of Android apps on Google Play. The results show that many of them are similar to each other and widely use fine-tuning techniques to pre-trained models on the Internet.",0
"This sounds interesting! Here's a sample abstract that I came up with based on your request: ---  In recent years, deep learning models have become increasingly popular for use in mobile applications such as image classification, object recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, these models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which seek to manipulate input data in order to cause errors or mispredictions by the model. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of on-device deep learning models running on Android devices against such attacks. We consider two types of adversarial attacks - targeted attacks, where the goal is to make the model output a specific incorrect label; and untargeted attacks, where the objective is simply to cause any incorrect label. Our results show that some models are more resistant to adversarial attacks than others, but overall there remains room for improvement in terms of model robustness. We provide recommendations for developers wishing to implement more robust models in their apps, including best practices for training, testing, and deployment. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of considering adversarial robustness alongside accuracy and efficiency when selecting deep learning models for deployment on consumer devices.",1
"In this paper we investigate the problem of automatically naming pieces of assembly code. Where by naming we mean assigning to an assembly function a string of words that would likely be assigned by a human reverse engineer. We formally and precisely define the framework in which our investigation takes place. That is we define the problem, we provide reasonable justifications for the choices that we made for the design of training and the tests. We performed an analysis on a large real-world corpora constituted by nearly 9 millions of functions taken from more than 22k softwares. In such framework we test baselines coming from the field of Natural Language Processing (e.g., Seq2Seq networks and Transformer). Interestingly, our evaluation shows promising results beating the state-of-the-art and reaching good performance. We investigate the applicability of tine-tuning (i.e., taking a model already trained on a large generic corpora and retraining it for a specific task). Such technique is popular and well-known in the NLP field. Our results confirm that fine-tuning is effective even when neural networks are applied to binaries. We show that a model, pre-trained on the aforementioned corpora, when fine-tuned has higher performances on specific domains (such as predicting names in system utilites, malware, etc).",0
"Title: Naming functions using neural networks  Abstract: One problem facing binary analysis today is that functions often have no name, making them hard to study further. To address this issue, we propose using machine learning techniques on symbolic representations of code fragments extracted from binaries to assign names to functions. We first describe our method for generating symbolic forms from assembly code and show how these forms can be used as inputs to neural network models. Then, we present two novel ways of leveraging semantic features related to control flow graphs derived from the same symbolic representation to improve function naming accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance at automatically assigning accurate function names to stripped binaries, outperforming several competitive baselines across five different benchmark datasets.",1
"Summarization of long sequences into a concise statement is a core problem in natural language processing, requiring non-trivial understanding of the input. Based on the promising results of graph neural networks on highly structured data, we develop a framework to extend existing sequence encoders with a graph component that can reason about long-distance relationships in weakly structured data such as text. In an extensive evaluation, we show that the resulting hybrid sequence-graph models outperform both pure sequence models as well as pure graph models on a range of summarization tasks.",0
"Automatically summarizing documents has been a challenging problem for natural language processing (NLP) researchers, as manually creating high-quality summaries can be time-consuming and difficult. In recent years, deep learning models have shown promise in tackling this task, but there remains a need for further improvement in terms of both performance and interpretability. In this paper, we present a novel approach called structured neural summarization that combines the strengths of both rule-based systems and deep learning methods to produce more accurate and coherent summaries. Our method incorporates structured representations, such as constituency parse trees, into the training process to ensure that the resulting summary retains important grammatical structures. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide analysis showing how the model makes use of structured features during inference. Overall, our work shows that incorporating explicit structure into neural networks can lead to substantial advances in text summarization tasks.",1
"We describe a procedure for explaining neurons in deep representations by identifying compositional logical concepts that closely approximate neuron behavior. Compared to prior work that uses atomic labels as explanations, analyzing neurons compositionally allows us to more precisely and expressively characterize their behavior. We use this procedure to answer several questions on interpretability in models for vision and natural language processing. First, we examine the kinds of abstractions learned by neurons. In image classification, we find that many neurons learn highly abstract but semantically coherent visual concepts, while other polysemantic neurons detect multiple unrelated features; in natural language inference (NLI), neurons learn shallow lexical heuristics from dataset biases. Second, we see whether compositional explanations give us insight into model performance: vision neurons that detect human-interpretable concepts are positively correlated with task performance, while NLI neurons that fire for shallow heuristics are negatively correlated with task performance. Finally, we show how compositional explanations provide an accessible way for end users to produce simple ""copy-paste"" adversarial examples that change model behavior in predictable ways.",0
"Abstract: The ability of neurons to process complex patterns lies at the heart of our understanding of how the brain functions. However, explaining precisely how these cells achieve such feats has proven challenging. In recent years, researchers have turned to compositional explanations as a potential solution to address this gap in knowledge. This approach involves breaking down complex systems into simpler parts and examining how those components interact to produce emergent properties. By applying this methodology to neuronal computation, we can gain insights into their function that would otherwise remain elusive.  In this review article, we explore the latest developments in using compositional explanations to analyze the operation of individual neurons. We begin by discussing the basic concepts behind this approach, including the principles of compositionality and emergence. Next, we examine several specific examples where compositional analyses have been employed to shed light on the workings of single neurons. These studies span multiple areas within neuroscience, ranging from sensory processing to decision making and beyond.  Finally, we consider some of the outstanding questions surrounding the application of compositional reasoning to neural phenomena. For instance, while compositional analyses have already yielded valuable insights, they cannot fully capture the complexity inherent to real nervous systems. Nevertheless, this approach holds great promise for improving our comprehension of how neurons operate, both individually and collectively.  By combining theoretical and empirical perspectives, we aim to provide readers with a broad perspective on the use of compositional explanations in studying neurons. Ultimately, we hope this synthesis will inspire new research directions and further deepen our understanding of neural computing mechanisms.",1
"Existing deep learning models applied to reaction prediction in organic chemistry can reach high levels of accuracy ( 90% for Natural Language Processing-based ones). With no chemical knowledge embedded than the information learnt from reaction data, the quality of the data sets plays a crucial role in the performance of the prediction models. While human curation is prohibitively expensive, the need for unaided approaches to remove chemically incorrect entries from existing data sets is essential to improve artificial intelligence models' performance in synthetic chemistry tasks. Here we propose a machine learning-based, unassisted approach to remove chemically wrong entries from chemical reaction collections. We applied this method to the collection of chemical reactions Pistachio and to an open data set, both extracted from USPTO (United States Patent Office) patents. Our results show an improved prediction quality for models trained on the cleaned and balanced data sets. For the retrosynthetic models, the round-trip accuracy metric grows by 13 percentage points and the value of the cumulative Jensen Shannon divergence decreases by 30% compared to its original record. The coverage remains high with 97%, and the value of the class-diversity is not affected by the cleaning. The proposed strategy is the first unassisted rule-free technique to address automatic noise reduction in chemical data sets.",0

"In this paper, we present a novel approach for conformal prediction (CP), in which we aim to identify a set of promising prediction candidates -- in place of a single prediction. This set is guaranteed to contain a correct answer with high probability, and is well-suited for many open-ended classification tasks. In the standard CP paradigm, the predicted set can often be unusably large and also costly to obtain. This is particularly pervasive in settings where the correct answer is not unique, and the number of total possible answers is high. We first expand the CP correctness criterion to allow for additional, inferred ""admissible"" answers, which can substantially reduce the size of the predicted set while still providing valid performance guarantees. Second, we amortize costs by conformalizing prediction cascades, in which we aggressively prune implausible labels early on by using progressively stronger classifiers -- again, while still providing valid performance guarantees. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach for multiple applications in natural language processing and computational chemistry for drug discovery.",0
"This is an article on conformal prediction which can be used to predict outcomes based on existing data sets. Explain the process of cascading inference and expanded admission in your own words. Include any relevant theory or application examples from real world scenarios in your explanation to make it more interesting and easier to follow along with. Abstract should be approximately 150-300 words. Abstract: Efficient conformal prediction is achieved through the use of cascaded inference and expanded admission. In cascading inference, multiple models are created at different resolutions, each using the output of the previous model as input. By doing so, the overall error rate of the system decreases, leading to improved performance. Expanded admission refers to the inclusion of additional training data points that lie outside the initial set of observations, allowing for better generalization and reduced uncertainty in predictions. Examples of these methods in action may be found in fields such as finance, where accurate forecasting of market trends is crucial for investors to make informed decisions. Overall, efficient conformal prediction has many applications across industries and holds great potential for driving innovation and progress.",1
"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learn representation from data with an impressive capability, and brought important breakthroughs for processing images, time-series, natural language, audio, video, and many others.

"We propose a new framework, Translation between Augmented Natural Languages (TANL), to solve many structured prediction language tasks including joint entity and relation extraction, nested named entity recognition, relation classification, semantic role labeling, event extraction, coreference resolution, and dialogue state tracking. Instead of tackling the problem by training task-specific discriminative classifiers, we frame it as a translation task between augmented natural languages, from which the task-relevant information can be easily extracted. Our approach can match or outperform task-specific models on all tasks, and in particular, achieves new state-of-the-art results on joint entity and relation extraction (CoNLL04, ADE, NYT, and ACE2005 datasets), relation classification (FewRel and TACRED), and semantic role labeling (CoNLL-2005 and CoNLL-2012). We accomplish this while using the same architecture and hyperparameters for all tasks and even when training a single model to solve all tasks at the same time (multi-task learning). Finally, we show that our framework can also significantly improve the performance in a low-resource regime, thanks to better use of label semantics.",0

Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over baseline approaches, showing consistent improvements across different domains and task types.",1
"Cycle-consistent training is widely used for jointly learning a forward and inverse mapping between two domains of interest without the cumbersome requirement of collecting matched pairs within each domain. In this regard, the implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one mappings during cycle training while promoting textural diversity for graph-to-text tasks.

"In this paper we present a system for training machine learning models that can generalize well on unseen tasks by using cycle consistency as a regularizer. This approach allows us to train models on large datasets where each task has many possible solutions but only one correct output label, such as language translation or semantic segmentation. We first introduce a new framework called DALL-E (short for ""deep autoencoder latent laundering""), which learns mappings from input data to hidden representations and back again in a cycle-consistency manner. By mapping inputs back to their original form, our model encourages them to capture task-invariant features that are robust to changes in the number and type of classes. Next, we demonstrate how to incorporate these cycle consistent maps into state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms like GPT-4 (Generative Pre-training Transformer) to improve performance over prior methods. Finally, we evaluate our method on several challenging benchmarks including image classification, natural language understanding, and reinforcement learning, showing significant improvements over baseline systems. These results highlight the potential power of our approach for enabling human-like intelligence across multiple domains.",1
"We propose a generalization of transformer neural network architecture for arbitrary graphs. The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has proven particularly effective on graph data such as social networks (LinkedIn), knowledge graphs (Wikipedia), biochemical compounds (proteins) and computer programs (code). This paper describes how transformer networks can be adapted to work with such graph data. We have developed a new system called ""GraphTransform"" that uses graph convolutional neural network layers to extend the power of transformers to these kinds of inputs. Our results show that our method significantly improves performance over baseline models across multiple datasets, including those used by major corporations such as Facebook and Google. Overall, we believe our work has broad implications for applications ranging from drug discovery to code generation.",1
"Many irregular domains such as social networks, financial transactions, neuron connections, and natural language constructs are represented using graph structures. In recent years, a variety of graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied for representation learning and prediction on such graphs. In many of the real-world applications, the underlying graph changes over time, however, most of the existing GNNs are inadequate for handling such dynamic graphs. In this paper we propose a novel technique for learning embeddings of dynamic graphs using a tensor algebra framework. Our method extends the popular graph convolutional network (GCN) for learning representations of dynamic graphs using the recently proposed tensor M-product technique. Theoretical results presented establish a connection between the proposed tensor approach and spectral convolution of tensors. The proposed method TM-GCN is consistent with the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework, accounting for both spatial and temporal message passing. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for edge classification and link prediction tasks on dynamic graphs. We also consider an application related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and show how our method can be used for early detection of infected individuals from contact tracing data.",0
"Dynamic graph convolutional networks have gained increasing interest due to their ability to effectively process data on irregular graphs. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are limited by their reliance on regular grid structures and cannot easily adapt to the complexities found in many real-world applications such as traffic management systems, social network analysis, biological pathway modeling, and financial market analysis. This work presents a novel methodology that leverages the tensor m-product operation to enable dynamic processing of irregular graphs. By incorporating a dynamic parameterization scheme, our approach can learn a different set of kernels at each layer of the graph convolution network, providing increased flexibility over traditional static kernel methods. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance compared to baseline methods across a range of application domains. Our framework paves the way towards more effective handling of irregularly structured big data through scalable machine learning algorithms that leverage the unique properties of modern computing paradigms such as GPU acceleration and distributed computing.",1
"Visual question answering requires a deep understanding of both images and natural language. However, most methods mainly focus on visual concept; such as the relationships between various objects. The limited use of object categories combined with their relationships or simple question embedding is insufficient for representing complex scenes and explaining decisions. To address this limitation, we propose the use of text expressions generated for images, because such expressions have few structural constraints and can provide richer descriptions of images. The generated expressions can be incorporated with visual features and question embedding to obtain the question-relevant answer. A joint-embedding multi-head attention network is also proposed to model three different information modalities with co-attention. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the proposed method on the VQA v2 dataset and compared it with state-of-the-art methods in terms of answer prediction. The quality of the generated expressions was also evaluated on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal that it outperformed all of the competing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results.",0

"A common vision from science fiction is that robots will one day inhabit our physical spaces, sense the world as we do, assist our physical labours, and communicate with us through natural language. Here we study how to design artificial agents that can interact naturally with humans using the simplification of a virtual environment. This setting nevertheless integrates a number of the central challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) research: complex visual perception and goal-directed physical control, grounded language comprehension and production, and multi-agent social interaction. To build agents that can robustly interact with humans, we would ideally train them while they interact with humans. However, this is presently impractical. Therefore, we approximate the role of the human with another learned agent, and use ideas from inverse reinforcement learning to reduce the disparities between human-human and agent-agent interactive behaviour. Rigorously evaluating our agents poses a great challenge, so we develop a variety of behavioural tests, including evaluation by humans who watch videos of agents or interact directly with them. These evaluations convincingly demonstrate that interactive training and auxiliary losses improve agent behaviour beyond what is achieved by supervised learning of actions alone. Further, we demonstrate that agent capabilities generalise beyond literal experiences in the dataset. Finally, we train evaluation models whose ratings of agents agree well with human judgement, thus permitting the evaluation of new agent models without additional effort. Taken together, our results in this virtual environment provide evidence that large-scale human behavioural imitation is a promising tool to create intelligent, interactive agents, and the challenge of reliably evaluating such agents is possible to surmount.",0
"Humans have always been fascinated by machines that can think like humans. From the earliest Greek myths to modern science fiction stories, we have imagined robots as our equals - intelligent beings with their own thoughts, feelings, and motivations. In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made these fantasies seem more plausible than ever before. Scientists and engineers have created algorithms and computer programs that can solve problems, recognize objects, and even engage in conversations with human-like wit and humor.  Despite these impressive accomplishments, however, most AI systems remain far behind the cognitive abilities of even the average human brain. We still lack a deep understanding of how the human mind works, and so building machines that truly mimic human thinking remains an elusive goal. But that hasn't stopped researchers from trying. And while today's efforts at imitating interactive intelligence may seem crude compared to future achievements, they already provide valuable insights into both human nature and machine learning. This paper explores some of the latest developments in AI technology and how they might shape our perceptions of consciousness, creativity, and other qualities traditionally associated with living organisms. By examining examples such as chatbots, game agents, and language models, we find that although machines cannot yet replicate all aspects of human thought, they nevertheless offer intriguing glimpses into the inner workings of both brains and computers. Ultimately, whether viewed as friends or foes, imitations of interactive intelligence challenge us to rethink the boundaries between humanity and machinery.",1
"On-device Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently gained more attention due to the increasing computing power of the mobile devices and the number of applications in Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Internet of Things (IoTs). Unfortunately, the existing efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures designed for CV tasks are not directly applicable to NLP tasks and the tiny Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures have been designed primarily for IoT applications. In NLP applications, although model compression has seen initial success in on-device text classification, there are at least three major challenges yet to be addressed: adversarial robustness, explainability, and personalization. Here we attempt to tackle these challenges by designing a new training scheme for model compression and adversarial robustness, including the optimization of an explainable feature mapping objective, a knowledge distillation objective, and an adversarially robustness objective. The resulting compressed model is personalized using on-device private training data via fine-tuning. We perform extensive experiments to compare our approach with both compact RNN (e.g., FastGRNN) and compressed RNN (e.g., PRADO) architectures in both natural and adversarial NLP test settings.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for adversarially robust model compression that allows on-device personalization for text classification tasks. We propose an approach based on pruning techniques that preserves accuracy while reducing computational overheads. Additionally, we introduce methods to improve explainability by generating explanations during deployment directly from compressed models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent performance across different datasets without significant loss in accuracy due to pruning. Furthermore, our system provides more interpretable results compared to baseline approaches, especially under adverse conditions such as noisy inputs and domain shifts. In conclusion, we show that our method can provide high prediction quality in addition to efficient inference latency while maintaining interpretability at both training and runtime phases, making it suitable for mobile platforms where privacy concerns require personalized model execution at edge devices.",1
"In this paper we propose a new framework - MoViLan (Modular Vision and Language) for execution of visually grounded natural language instructions for day to day indoor household tasks. While several data-driven, end-to-end learning frameworks have been proposed for targeted navigation tasks based on the vision and language modalities, performance on recent benchmark data sets revealed the gap in developing comprehensive techniques for long horizon, compositional tasks (involving manipulation and navigation) with diverse object categories, realistic instructions and visual scenarios with non-reversible state changes. We propose a modular approach to deal with the combined navigation and object interaction problem without the need for strictly aligned vision and language training data (e.g., in the form of expert demonstrated trajectories). Such an approach is a significant departure from the traditional end-to-end techniques in this space and allows for a more tractable training process with separate vision and language data sets. Specifically, we propose a novel geometry-aware mapping technique for cluttered indoor environments, and a language understanding model generalized for household instruction following. We demonstrate a significant increase in success rates for long-horizon, compositional tasks over the baseline on the recently released benchmark data set-ALFRED.",0
"This paper presents a new framework for visual navigation and manipulation tasks that can handle long time horizons and complex environments. Our approach uses a combination of modular planning techniques and high-level abstraction to allow agents to operate effectively in uncertain and dynamic settings. We evaluate our method on a range of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating robust performance across a variety of environments and task types. Our work advances the state of the art in visual navigation, enabling agents to plan and execute more effective policies in realistic scenarios.",1
"Discrete latent spaces in variational autoencoders have been shown to effectively capture the data distribution for many real-world problems such as natural language understanding, human intent prediction, and visual scene representation. However, discrete latent spaces need to be sufficiently large to capture the complexities of real-world data, rendering downstream tasks computationally challenging. For instance, performing motion planning in a high-dimensional latent representation of the environment could be intractable. We consider the problem of sparsifying the discrete latent space of a trained conditional variational autoencoder, while preserving its learned multimodality. As a post hoc latent space reduction technique, we use evidential theory to identify the latent classes that receive direct evidence from a particular input condition and filter out those that do not. Experiments on diverse tasks, such as image generation and human behavior prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique at reducing the discrete latent sample space size of a model while maintaining its learned multimodality.",0

"Policy specification is a process by which a human can initialize a robot's behaviour and, in turn, warm-start policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). While policy specification/design is inherently a collaborative process, modern methods based on Learning from Demonstration or Deep RL lack the model interpretability and accessibility to be classified as such. Current state-of-the-art methods for policy specification rely on black-box models, which are an insufficient means of collaboration for non-expert users: These models provide no means of inspecting policies learnt by the agent and are not focused on creating a usable modality for teaching robot behaviour. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning framework that enables humans to 1) specify, through natural language, interpretable policies in the form of easy-to-understand decision trees, 2) leverage these policies to warm-start reinforcement learning and 3) outperform baselines that lack our natural language initialization mechanism. We train our approach by collecting a first-of-its-kind corpus mapping free-form natural language policy descriptions to decision tree-based policies. We show that our novel framework translates natural language to decision trees with a 96% and 97% accuracy on a held-out corpus across two domains, respectively. Finally, we validate that policies initialized with natural language commands are able to significantly outperform relevant baselines (p  0.001) that do not benefit from our natural language-based warm-start technique.",0
"As of late, there has been increasing interest in creating intelligent agents that can act autonomously in complex, uncertain environments while remaining transparent, interpretable, and explainable. To address these concerns, we propose a novel framework that utilizes natural language processing techniques to effectively translate human instructions into policy specifications, allowing end users to have control over their agents without requiring extensive knowledge of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms or Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our approach enables efficient synthesis of both model-free and model-based policies by leveraging deep neural networks that capture essential features from raw sensory input data and contextualizing them with linguistic expressions provided by humans. By facilitating seamless interaction between humans and machines via natural language, our method offers substantial benefits for applications where interpretability, transparency, and safety are crucial, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, education, entertainment, and other domains involving decision making under uncertainty. --- Author Keywords: Natural Language Processing; Human-Machine Interaction; Model-Free and Model-Based Policies; Transparent and Explainable Intelligent Agents; Policy Search and Optimization; Refinement Techniques.

"Self-attention architectures, which are rapidly pushing the frontier in natural language processing, demonstrate a surprising depth-inefficient behavior: previous works indicate that increasing the internal representation (network width) is just as useful as increasing the number of self-attention layers (network depth). We theoretically predict a width-dependent transition between depth-efficiency and depth-inefficiency in self-attention. We conduct systematic empirical ablations on networks of depths 6 to 48 that clearly reveal the theoretically predicted behaviors, and provide explicit quantitative suggestions regarding the optimal depth-to-width allocation for a given self-attention network size. The race towards beyond 1-Trillion parameter language models renders informed guidelines for increasing self-attention depth and width in tandem an essential ingredient. Our guidelines elucidate the depth-to-width trade-off in self-attention networks of sizes up to the scale of GPT3 (which we project to be too deep for its size), and beyond, marking an unprecedented width of 30K as optimal for a 1-Trillion parameter network.",0
"In natural language processing (NLP), self-attention has emerged as a powerful mechanism for modeling interdependencies between sequences. However, existing methods often struggle with computation complexity due to their quadratic space/time growth w.r.t. input length. This study proposes a novel family of efficient attention mechanisms called ""Depthwise Separable Attention"" (DSA) that adaptively separates depth (channel dimension) from width (sequence length). Unlike prior works that perform pointwise convolutions across all dimensions simultaneously, DSA processes each position along a sequence independently by attending only over a small set of informative positions sampled uniformly at random from the entire sequence. By decoupling the complexities of query processing from both input length and channel size, we achieve unprecedented computational efficiency while retaining competitive performance on various NLP tasks. Extensive empirical studies confirm our method can scale up existing transformer architectures by orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy, enabling new possibilities for real-world applications such as low-latency translation. Our findings have important implications for developing effective machine learning models that balance time/space cost with generalization ability.",1
"The task of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) consists in answering natural language questions about a video and serves as a proxy to evaluate the performance of a model in scene sequence understanding. Most methods designed for VideoQA up-to-date are end-to-end deep learning architectures which struggle at complex temporal and causal reasoning and provide limited transparency in reasoning steps. We present the HySTER: a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Event Reasoner to reason over physical events in videos. Our model leverages the strength of deep learning methods to extract information from video frames with the reasoning capabilities and explainability of symbolic artificial intelligence in an answer set programming framework. We define a method based on general temporal, causal and physics rules which can be transferred across tasks. We apply our model to the CLEVRER dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in question answering accuracy. This work sets the foundations for the incorporation of inductive logic programming in the field of VideoQA.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm called HySTER (Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Event Reasoner) that addresses the problem of event reasoning in spatial domains. HySTER combines logical and geometric representations of events to reason about spatio-temporal relationships within a domain. By utilizing both forms of representation, HySTER can effectively handle uncertainty, occlusion, and other complexities often found in real world applications. Our approach has been validated through simulation experiments and demonstrates significant improvement over previous methods in terms of accuracy and scalability. We believe that our work provides a promising direction towards building more intelligent systems capable of robust event monitoring and decision making in dynamic environments.",1
"Training robust deep learning models for down-stream tasks is a critical challenge. Research has shown that down-stream models can be easily fooled with adversarial inputs that look like the training data, but slightly perturbed, in a way imperceptible to humans. Understanding the behavior of natural language models under these attacks is crucial to better defend these models against such attacks. In the black-box attack setting, where no access to model parameters is available, the attacker can only query the output information from the targeted model to craft a successful attack. Current black-box state-of-the-art models are costly in both computational complexity and number of queries needed to craft successful adversarial examples. For real world scenarios, the number of queries is critical, where less queries are desired to avoid suspicion towards an attacking agent. In this paper, we propose Explain2Attack, a black-box adversarial attack on text classification task. Instead of searching for important words to be perturbed by querying the target model, Explain2Attack employs an interpretable substitute model from a similar domain to learn word importance scores. We show that our framework either achieves or out-performs attack rates of the state-of-the-art models, yet with lower queries cost and higher efficiency.",0
"This paper presents a new method for generating adversarial attacks on text classification models that utilizes cross-domain interpretability techniques. We propose the use of explanations generated by these methods as guidance for creating effective perturbation strategies, allowing us to generate highly potent attacks using minimal modifications. Our approach, which we call ""Explain2Attack,"" combines state-of-the-art textual feature attribution algorithms with domain adaptation techniques to effectively transfer interpretability knowledge across domains. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework against diverse text classification models trained on various datasets, indicating significant improvement over prior attack approaches. Overall, this work provides important insights into understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities in modern deep learning systems, particularly those operating in security-sensitive applications such as natural language processing.",1
"In this paper, we propose CI-VI an efficient and scalable solver for semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI). Our method, first, maps SIVI's evidence lower bound (ELBO) to a form involving a nonlinear functional nesting of expected values and then develops a rigorous optimiser capable of correctly handling bias inherent to nonlinear nested expectations using an extrapolation-smoothing mechanism coupled with gradient sketching. Our theoretical results demonstrate convergence to a stationary point of the ELBO in general non-convex settings typically arising when using deep network models and an order of $O(t^{-\frac{4}{5}})$ gradient-bias-vanishing rate. We believe these results generalise beyond the specific nesting arising from SIVI to other forms. Finally, in a set of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in approximating complex posteriors on various data-sets including those from natural language processing.",0
"Abstract This paper presents a new method called Efficient Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (ESIVI) which combines variational inference methods from statistical machine learning with classical implicit solvers based on matrix factorization techniques. Our approach uses dual decomposition to efficiently optimize over model parameters without requiring the computation of explicit gradients, while still ensuring that all stationary points of the problem have been found. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both synthetic data experiments and real-world image denoising tasks, showing improvements in accuracy compared to state-of-the art algorithms.",1
"Identifier names convey useful information about the intended semantics of code. Name-based program analyses use this information, e.g., to detect bugs, to predict types, and to improve the readability of code. At the core of name-based analyses are semantic representations of identifiers, e.g., in the form of learned embeddings. The high-level goal of such a representation is to encode whether two identifiers, e.g., len and size, are semantically similar. Unfortunately, it is currently unclear to what extent semantic representations match the semantic relatedness and similarity perceived by developers. This paper presents IdBench, the first benchmark for evaluating semantic representations against a ground truth created from thousands of ratings by 500 software developers. We use IdBench to study state-of-the-art embedding techniques proposed for natural language, an embedding technique specifically designed for source code, and lexical string distance functions. Our results show that the effectiveness of semantic representations varies significantly and that the best available embeddings successfully represent semantic relatedness. On the downside, no existing technique provides a satisfactory representation of semantic similarities, among other reasons because identifiers with opposing meanings are incorrectly considered to be similar, which may lead to fatal mistakes, e.g., in a refactoring tool. Studying the strengths and weaknesses of the different techniques shows that they complement each other. As a first step toward exploiting this complementarity, we present an ensemble model that combines existing techniques and that clearly outperforms the best available semantic representation.",0
"How can we effectively evaluate semantic representations of identifier names in source code? This task becomes more challenging as software systems grow larger and become increasingly complex. In our research, we introduce IdBench, a framework that enables systematic evaluation of semantic identifier name representations through benchmarking studies. By leveraging existing tools for static analysis, IdBench generates representative samples of identifiers from large software repositories, enabling comprehensive evaluations without requiring access to the entirety of any given repository. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques to create gold standard references for each benchmark based on expert annotations. We apply our methodology by evaluating three state-of-the-art semantic representations across multiple programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Through these experiments, we demonstrate how IdBench enables automated and detailed comparisons between different approaches to modeling semantic meaning using identifier names, providing new insights into current limitations and opportunities for future work. In summary, IdBench represents a step forward in advancing the study of identifiers within software engineering contexts, allowing researchers to draw accurate conclusions regarding their performance at scale.",1
"Video captioning is a popular task that challenges models to describe events in videos using natural language. In this work, we investigate the ability of various visual feature representations derived from state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to capture high-level semantic context. We introduce the Weighted Additive Fusion Transformer with Memory Augmented Encoders (WAFTM), a captioning model that incorporates memory in a transformer encoder and uses a novel method, to fuse features, that ensures due importance is given to more significant representations. We illustrate a gain in performance realized by applying Word-Piece Tokenization and a popular REINFORCE algorithm. Finally, we benchmark our model on two datasets and obtain a CIDEr of 92.4 on MSVD and a METEOR of 0.091 on the ActivityNet Captions Dataset.",0
"This paper presents an exploratory study on the use of visual features and their weighted-additive fusion for video captioning tasks. The authors investigate different combinations of pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and their corresponding visual feature extraction techniques, such as VGGNet, ResNet, InceptionV3, and MobileNet, to identify which combination produces the most accurate captions. Additionally, they propose a weighted additive approach that combines multiple visual features from different CNNs into one overall representation, allowing each model to contribute its strengths towards generating more effective captions. To evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches, experiments were conducted using several popular benchmark datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, and LSMDC. Results demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating both visual and textual modalities and highlight promising future directions for video captioning research. Overall, this work contributes to the growing body of knowledge in computer vision and natural language processing by advancing methods for automated video understanding through caption generation.",1
"In this paper, we teach machines to understand visuals and natural language by learning the mapping between sentences and noisy video snippets without explicit annotations. Firstly, we define a self-supervised learning framework that captures the cross-modal information. A novel adversarial learning module is then introduced to explicitly handle the noises in the natural videos, where the subtitle sentences are not guaranteed to be strongly corresponded to the video snippets. For training and evaluation, we contribute a new dataset `ApartmenTour' that contains a large number of online videos and subtitles. We carry out experiments on the bidirectional retrieval tasks between sentences and videos, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both retrieval tasks and exceeds several strong baselines. The dataset can be downloaded at https://github.com/zyj-13/WAL.",0
"In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training machine vision models on large amounts of data without relying on labeled examples. However, most existing methods have focused on still images rather than videos. In this work, we propose a novel approach that uses natural language instructions and video frames to learn visual representations that can generalize to new contexts. Our method consists of three main components: a textual prompt generator that generates natural language descriptions of scenes in noisy real-world videos; a pretext task module that learns to predict which pixels match the given description; and a model that maps learned features into a semantic space where they can be compared against human judgments. We evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness at mapping visual content to natural language descriptors and vice versa. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing evidence that watch and learn strategies can indeed scale to complex real-world environments.",1
"Transformer has become the new standard method in natural language processing (NLP), and it also attracts research interests in computer vision area. In this paper we investigate the application of Transformer in Image Quality (TRIQ) assessment. Following the original Transformer encoder employed in Vision Transformer (ViT), we propose an architecture of using a shallow Transformer encoder on the top of a feature map extracted by convolution neural networks (CNN). Adaptive positional embedding is employed in the Transformer encoder to handle images with arbitrary resolutions. Different settings of Transformer architectures have been investigated on publicly available image quality databases. We have found that the proposed TRIQ architecture achieves outstanding performance. The implementation of TRIQ is published on Github (https://github.com/junyongyou/triq).",0

Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization capability of our proposed approach on previously unseen data by evaluating it under real-world scenarios encountered during content delivery over cellular networks where QoE can vary significantly due to changes in network conditions.",1
"Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in reduction of uncertainties during both optimization and decision making processes. It can be applied to solve a variety of real-world applications in science and engineering. Bayesian approximation and ensemble learning techniques are two most widely-used UQ methods in the literature. In this regard, researchers have proposed different UQ methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as computer vision (e.g., self-driving cars and object detection), image processing (e.g., image restoration), medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation), natural language processing (e.g., text classification, social media texts and recidivism risk-scoring), bioinformatics, etc. This study reviews recent advances in UQ methods used in deep learning. Moreover, we also investigate the application of these methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Then, we outline a few important applications of UQ methods. Finally, we briefly highlight the fundamental research challenges faced by UQ methods and discuss the future research directions in this field.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in quantifying uncertainty in deep learning models due to their increasing adoption in real world applications where decision making and reliability can have serious consequences if incorrect predictions are made by these systems. Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely on large amounts of data which can often suffer from noise, corruption or insufficient representation leading to high variance during optimization resulting in poor generalization performance. This paper reviews several techniques developed for model calibration to reduce overconfidence of DNNs through probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo dropout (MC). Techniques like Bayesian Neural Networks enable efficient estimation of confidence intervals which is crucial when operating under limited computational resources. MC provides a computationally cheap alternative that approximates predictive uncertainties at test time without requiring additional training which makes it more suitable when deploying the models onto edge devices like mobile phones. These techniques are applied into different domains including image classification, object detection, sentiment analysis and natural language processing illustrating improved performances using uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we discuss limitations that arise when applying the previously mentioned approaches due to neglected challenges related to hyperparameter tuning, loss landscapes, non stationary environments and data quality assessment . As future work direction, we propose solutions directed towards mitigating some of these issues in order to further improve accuracy and trustworthiness in deep learning systems. Finally, in conclusion we provide recommendations for researchers interested in studying these topics to expand upon the current state of art given our detailed insight i",1
"When minimizing the empirical risk in binary classification, it is a common practice to replace the zero-one loss with a surrogate loss to make the learning objective feasible to optimize. Examples of well-known surrogate losses for binary classification include the logistic loss, hinge loss, and sigmoid loss. It is known that the choice of a surrogate loss can highly influence the performance of the trained classifier and therefore it should be carefully chosen. Recently, surrogate losses that satisfy a certain symmetric condition (aka., symmetric losses) have demonstrated their usefulness in learning from corrupted labels. In this article, we provide an overview of symmetric losses and their applications. First, we review how a symmetric loss can yield robust classification from corrupted labels in balanced error rate (BER) minimization and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) maximization. Then, we demonstrate how the robust AUC maximization method can benefit natural language processing in the problem where we want to learn only from relevant keywords and unlabeled documents. Finally, we conclude this article by discussing future directions, including potential applications of symmetric losses for reliable machine learning and the design of non-symmetric losses that can benefit from the symmetric condition.",0
"In recent years, machine learning has been revolutionized by deep learning techniques that allow models to learn highly expressive function approximators from large datasets. However, these powerful methods have often yielded surprisingly poor results on out-of-sample data compared to classical statistics or other modeling approaches. To address this issue, we present a new approach called symmetric loss (SL) which focuses on improving accuracy for both training and test sets. We demonstrate how SL can recover previously known insights and provide better predictions for challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR, Penn Treebank, and TIMIT, using popular architectures like ResNet and Transformer models trained via backprop. This work extends prior art that relies solely on asymmetrical metrics like cross entropy loss during training to achieve desired performance. Our findings suggest that incorporating symmetrization into modern machine learning pipelines may improve overall predictability and reliability. Future studies can further explore the relationship between dataset size and model capacity relative to the degree of symmetrization applied towards achieving high validation accuracy. The code accompanying this article implements our technique in PyTorch.",1
"Recently, a special kind of graph, i.e., supernet, which allows two nodes connected by multi-choice edges, has exhibited its power in neural architecture search (NAS) by searching for better architectures for computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we discover that the design of such discrete architectures also appears in many other important learning tasks, e.g., logical chain inference in knowledge graphs (KGs) and meta-path discovery in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). Thus, we are motivated to generalize the supernet search problem on a broader horizon. However, none of the existing works are effective since the supernet topology is highly task-dependent and diverse. To address this issue, we propose to tensorize the supernet, i.e., unify the subgraph search problems by a tensor formulation and encode the topology inside the supernet by a tensor network. We further propose an efficient algorithm that admits both stochastic and deterministic objectives to solve the search problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on diverse learning tasks, i.e., architecture design for CV, logic inference for KG, and meta-path discovery for HIN. Empirical results demonstrate that our method leads to better performance and architectures.",0
"""The problem we study concerns finding a subgraph within another graph satisfying certain properties: these may depend on edge labels as well as vertex colors.

"Machine Learning has been applied in a wide range of tasks throughout the last years, ranging from image classification to autonomous driving and natural language processing. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) has received recent attention and relies on an energy-based structure to model data probability distributions. Notwithstanding, such a technique is susceptible to adversarial manipulation, i.e., slightly or profoundly modified data. An alternative to overcome the adversarial problem lies in the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), capable of modeling data distributions and generating adversarial data that resemble the original ones. Therefore, this work proposes to artificially generate RBMs using Adversarial Learning, where pre-trained weight matrices serve as the GAN inputs. Furthermore, it proposes to sample copious amounts of matrices and combine them into ensembles, alleviating the burden of training new models'. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach under image reconstruction and image classification tasks, and describe how artificial-based ensembles are alternatives to pre-training vast amounts of RBMs.",0
"Title: A Novel Approach to Ensemble Learning using Generative Models. This paper introduces a new method for ensemble learning that leverages adversarial training on generative models. Our approach uses restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) as the foundation of our generative models, which allows us to efficiently learn complex relationships within large datasets. By incorporating an adversarial component into the training process, we can improve the generalization performance of these models across different tasks and domains. In particular, we show how this approach outperforms traditional ensembling methods in several benchmark experiments. We believe this work represents an important step towards more effective ensemble learning techniques in deep neural networks.",1
"Image captioning is a challenging computer vision task, which aims to generate a natural language description of an image. Most recent researches follow the encoder-decoder framework which depends heavily on the previous generated words for the current prediction. Such methods can not effectively take advantage of the future predicted information to learn complete semantics. In this paper, we propose Context-Aware Auxiliary Guidance (CAAG) mechanism that can guide the captioning model to perceive global contexts. Upon the captioning model, CAAG performs semantic attention that selectively concentrates on useful information of the global predictions to reproduce the current generation. To validate the adaptability of the method, we apply CAAG to three popular captioners and our proposal achieves competitive performance on the challenging Microsoft COCO image captioning benchmark, e.g. 132.2 CIDEr-D score on Karpathy split and 130.7 CIDEr-D (c40) score on official online evaluation server.",0
"Our work presents a novel model for image caption generation that uses auxiliary guidance derived from contextual relationships within images themselves. These relationships could reflect spatial, temporal, causal, or other forms of logical interdependencies among multiple objects visible in the scene. By incorporating these cues into our captioning pipeline, we aim to improve the quality and coherence of generated descriptions by aligning them more closely with visual features present in input images. This approach brings together insights from both computer vision and natural language processing domains, and advances our understanding of how humans process complex scenes through integrating multimodal signals. We demonstrate on standard benchmark datasets the effectiveness of using context-aware auxiliary guidance in generating accurate, informative, and diverse captions, outperforming strong baselines that rely exclusively on image content or text prompts alone. While previous efforts have explored adding external knowledge sources like semantic concepts or human annotations to enhance captioning capabilities, here we focus instead on discovering latent relationships hidden inside each individual picture, which might serve as internal supervision or complementary signal when such explicit data is scarce or unavailable. Our findings suggest promising directions towards developing intelligent agents capable of understanding and narrating complex dynamic events involving numerous entities acting over time.",1

"With the advent of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning technologies, several industries are moving towards the field. Applications of such technologies are highly diverse ranging from natural language processing to computer vision. Object recognition is one such area in the computer vision domain. Although proven to perform with high accuracy, there are still areas where such models can be improved. This is in-fact highly important in real-world use cases like autonomous driving or cancer detection, that are highly sensitive and expect such technologies to have almost no uncertainties. In this paper, we attempt to visualise the uncertainties in object recognition models and propose a correction process via user feedback. We further demonstrate our approach on the data provided by the VAST 2020 Mini-Challenge 2.",0
"This article describes how we used machine learning models that process images taken by smartphone cameras to identify objects such as cars, houses, animals, etc., but they didn’t work very well, so we collected new data using an interactive game on real phones connected via wifi from Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, and fed them into another model which was able to give correct answers over 97% of the time. Our techniques were inspired by prior researchers who had similar problems but did it manually instead of using crowdsourcing like us. We expect our method to become more important as computer vision is applied to many different fields because it allows models to keep improving as they learn from their mistakes. We hope other researchers can build upon our work to create even better methods for fixing errors in object recognition systems. We close by discussing several promising directions for future research.",1
"One of the most challenging problems in the field of intrusion detection is anomaly detection for discrete event logs. While most earlier work focused on applying unsupervised learning upon engineered features, most recent work has started to resolve this challenge by applying deep learning methodology to abstraction of discrete event entries. Inspired by natural language processing, LSTM-based anomaly detection models were proposed. They try to predict upcoming events, and raise an anomaly alert when a prediction fails to meet a certain criterion. However, such a predict-next-event methodology has a fundamental limitation: event predictions may not be able to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of sequences. This limitation leads to high false positives (FPs) and high false negatives (FNs). It is also critical to examine the structure of sequences and the bi-directional causality among individual events. To this end, we propose a new methodology: Recomposing event sequences as anomaly detection. We propose DabLog, a Deep Autoencoder-Based anomaly detection method for discrete event Logs. The fundamental difference is that, rather than predicting upcoming events, our approach determines whether a sequence is normal or abnormal by analyzing (encoding) and reconstructing (decoding) the given sequence. Our evaluation results show that our new methodology can significantly reduce the numbers of FPs and FNs, hence achieving a higher $F_1$ score.",0
"Our proposed method offers a novel approach to anomaly detection for discrete events based on autoencoders. By utilizing a combination of recomposition and prediction techniques, we are able to accurately identify rare events that deviate from expected behavior while maintaining computational efficiency. This method is particularly suited for high-dimensional data sets with complex dependencies, where traditional anomaly detection methods may struggle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, showing significant improvement over state-of-the-art baseline models. Overall, our work presents a promising new direction for unsupervised learning in the field of anomaly detection.",1
"Electrical energy is a vital part of modern life, and expectations for grid resilience to allow a continuous and reliable energy supply has tremendously increased even during adverse events (e.g., Ukraine cyber-attack, Hurricane Maria). The global pandemic COVID-19 has raised the electric energy reliability risk due to potential workforce disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and increased possible cybersecurity threats. The pandemic introduces a significant degree of uncertainly to the grid operation in the presence of other extreme events like natural disasters, unprecedented outages, aging power grids, high proliferation of distributed generation, and cyber-attacks. This situation increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events. Solutions to manage such an adverse scenario will be multi-fold: a) emergency planning and organizational support, b) following safety protocol, c) utilizing enhanced automation and sensing for situational awareness, and d) integration of advanced technologies and data points for ML-driven enhanced decision support. Enhanced digitalization and automation resulted in better network visibility at various levels, including generation, transmission, and distribution. These data or information can be utilized to take advantage of advanced machine learning techniques for automation and increased power grid resilience. In this paper, a) we review the impact of COVID-19 on power grid operations and actions taken by operators/organizations to minimize the impact of COVID-19, and b) we have presented the recently developed tool and concepts using natural language processing (NLP) in the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence that can be used for increasing resiliency of power systems in normal and in extreme scenarios such as COVID-19 pandemics.",0
"This paper discusses how data can be used to improve grid resilience during a crisis like Covid-19. We focus on describing two important aspects related to grid operation that benefit from data analysis: contingency planning, which seeks to prepare for potential extreme events; and real-time operation, where timely decisions aimed at preventing cascading failures have significant impacts. With respect to contingency planning, historical grid event data, combined with weather forecasting models, can provide insights into the likelihood of specific risks occurring. By leveraging these data streams, utilities can optimize their investment in infrastructure maintenance and enhance emergency response plans under resource constraints. Real-time operation involves managing uncontrollable loads (such as distributed photovoltaics) while maintaining reliable service quality to customers. To achieve this goal, advanced algorithms need access to granular power consumption data. Given appropriate security measures, sharing aggregate load shapes within distribution feeders among multiple parties could lead to improved management strategies without compromising privacy. For both use cases, we highlight benefits from integrating diverse datasets originating from external sources beyond traditional SCADA systems. Open availability of such datasets further encourages innovation through research communities worldwide. The contributions provided by this work intend to spark a productive discussion on responsible collection and usage of data assets critical to enhancing overall system reliability. Ultimately, society must find ways to collectively support sustainable development without sacrificing the privacy and autonomy of individual citizens. These dual objectives require tradeoffs demanding thoughtful consideration throughout all sectors, including utilit",1
"We address the problem of retrieving a specific moment from an untrimmed video by a query sentence. This is a challenging problem because a target moment may take place in relations to other temporal moments in the untrimmed video. Existing methods cannot tackle this challenge well since they consider temporal moments individually and neglect the temporal dependencies. In this paper, we model the temporal relations between video moments by a two-dimensional map, where one dimension indicates the starting time of a moment and the other indicates the end time. This 2D temporal map can cover diverse video moments with different lengths, while representing their adjacent relations. Based on the 2D map, we propose a Temporal Adjacent Network (2D-TAN), a single-shot framework for moment localization. It is capable of encoding the adjacent temporal relation, while learning discriminative features for matching video moments with referring expressions. We evaluate the proposed 2D-TAN on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., Charades-STA, ActivityNet Captions, and TACoS, where our 2D-TAN outperforms the state-of-the-art.",0
"Automatically detecting moments from videos using natural language queries has been challenging due to the difficulty in accurately aligning textual descriptions with specific frames. In this work, we propose a novel approach called ""Learning 2D Temporal Adjacent Network"" (LaTAN) that utilizes temporal adjacent relationships to learn discriminative moment localizations directly from video clips and natural language query sequences. LaTAN extracts spatio-temporal features by sampling dense grid locations within a clip at different time intervals. Our design enables end-to-end training of feature extraction and subsequent matching components without requiring any external supervision. We demonstrate that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark datasets, MovieCorpus and Charades, yielding significantly higher recall@1 scores while maintaining competitive nDCG performance. This suggests that our proposed model can effectively learn discriminative representations for moments localized through natural language queries. Overall, these results show promise towards building intelligent video retrieval systems based on fine-grained textual inputs.",1

Moreover, transforming an object or person to a desired shape become a well-studied research in the GANs. GANs are powerful models for learning complex distributions to synthesize semantically meaningful samples. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review in this field, especially lack of a collection of GANs loss-variant, evaluation metrics, remedies for diverse image generation, and stable training. Given the current fast GANs development, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of adversarial models for image synthesis.

"We study reinforcement learning (RL) for text-based games, which are interactive simulations in the context of natural language. While different methods have been developed to represent the environment information and language actions, existing RL agents are not empowered with any reasoning capabilities to deal with textual games. In this work, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge graphs for decision making, so that the actions of an agent are generated and supported by an interpretable inference procedure.

"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate in a real-world environment following natural language instructions. From both the textual and visual perspectives, we find that the relationships among the scene, its objects,and directional clues are essential for the agent to interpret complex instructions and correctly perceive the environment. To capture and utilize the relationships, we propose a novel Language and Visual Entity Relationship Graph for modelling the inter-modal relationships between text and vision, and the intra-modal relationships among visual entities. We propose a message passing algorithm for propagating information between language elements and visual entities in the graph, which we then combine to determine the next action to take. Experiments show that by taking advantage of the relationships we are able to improve over state-of-the-art. On the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark, our method achieves the new best performance on the test unseen split with success rate weighted by path length (SPL) of 52%. On the Room-for-Room (R4R) dataset, our method significantly improves the previous best from 13% to 34% on the success weighted by normalized dynamic time warping (SDTW).

These graph structures allow agents to reason about their surroundings more efficiently and accurately than by relying solely on textual descriptions. Our approach improves over previous work by incorporating both static visual features and dynamic sensor data into our relation extraction process, allowing us to obtain richer and more accurate representation of navigational environments.

"Deep neural networks have been successfully deployed in various domains of artificial intelligence, including computer vision and natural language processing. We observe that the current standard procedure for training DNNs discards all the learned information in the past epochs except the current learned weights. An interesting question is: is this discarded information indeed useless? We argue that the discarded information can benefit the subsequent training. In this paper, we propose learning with retrospection (LWR) which makes use of the learned information in the past epochs to guide the subsequent training. LWR is a simple yet effective training framework to improve accuracies, calibration, and robustness of DNNs without introducing any additional network parameters or inference cost, only with a negligible training overhead. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of LWR for training DNNs.",0

"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has made significant strides towards enabling machines to generate human-like language, including image descriptions and translations. However, most research in natural language processing (NLP) relies on large amounts of hand-annotated data which may not always be feasible or available. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) to generate Bangla captions from images. Our model takes as input an image and generates a sequence of Bangla characters, effectively translating the visual content into text. We evaluate our model against several benchmark datasets and show promising results, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Our method allows us to generate accurate Bangla captions without requiring extensive manual annotations or parallel corpora.

"Mesh is a powerful data structure for 3D shapes. Representation learning for 3D meshes is important in many computer vision and graphics applications. The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for structured data (e.g., images) suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN for 3D shapes. However, 3D shape data are irregular since each node's neighbors are unordered. Various graph neural networks for 3D shapes have been developed with isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems to overcome the node inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems limit the representation power. In this paper, we propose a local structure-aware anisotropic convolutional operation (LSA-Conv) that learns adaptive weighting matrices for each node according to the local neighboring structure and performs shared anisotropic filters. In fact, the learnable weighting matrix is similar to the attention matrix in the random synthesizer -- a new Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model produces significant improvement in 3D shape reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Since the publication of the original Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017), Transformers revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing. This, mainly due to their ability to understand timely dependencies better than competing RNN-based architectures. Surprisingly, this architecture change does not affect the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), even though RNNs are quite popular in RL, and time dependencies are very common in RL. Recently, Parisotto et al. 2019) conducted the first promising research of Transformers in RL. To support the findings of this work, this paper seeks to provide an additional example of a Transformer-based RL method. Specifically, the goal is a simple Transformer-based Deep Q-Learning method that is stable over several environments. Due to the unstable nature of Transformers and RL, an extensive method search was conducted to arrive at a final method that leverages developments around Transformers as well as Q-learning. The proposed method can match the performance of classic Q-learning on control environments while showing potential on some selected Atari benchmarks. Furthermore, it was critically evaluated to give additional insights into the relation between Transformers and RL.",0
"Transformers have become popular models for natural language processing tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies effectively.

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved outstanding performance in a wide range of applications, e.g., image classification, natural language processing, etc. Despite the good performance, the huge number of parameters in DNNs brings challenges to efficient training of DNNs and also their deployment in low-end devices with limited computing resources. In this paper, we explore the correlations in the weight matrices, and approximate the weight matrices with the low-rank block-term tensors. We name the new corresponding structure as block-term tensor layers (BT-layers), which can be easily adapted to neural network models, such as CNNs and RNNs. In particular, the inputs and the outputs in BT-layers are reshaped into low-dimensional high-order tensors with a similar or improved representation power. Sufficient experiments have demonstrated that BT-layers in CNNs and RNNs can achieve a very large compression ratio on the number of parameters while preserving or improving the representation power of the original DNNs.",0

"Biological data including gene expression data are generally high-dimensional and require efficient, generalizable, and scalable machine-learning methods to discover their complex nonlinear patterns. The recent advances in machine learning can be attributed to deep neural networks (DNNs), which excel in various tasks in terms of computer vision and natural language processing. However, standard DNNs are not appropriate for high-dimensional datasets generated in biology because they have many parameters, which in turn require many samples. In this paper, we propose a DNN-based, nonlinear feature selection method, called the feature selection network (FsNet), for high-dimensional and small number of sample data. Specifically, FsNet comprises a selection layer that selects features and a reconstruction layer that stabilizes the training. Because a large number of parameters in the selection and reconstruction layers can easily result in overfitting under a limited number of samples, we use two tiny networks to predict the large, virtual weight matrices of the selection and reconstruction layers. Experimental results on several real-world, high-dimensional biological datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",0
"Title: FsNet: Feature Selection Network on High-dimensional Biological Data  Abstract: This paper presents a new method for selecting features from high-dimensional biological data sets. The proposed approach uses a neural network architecture that learns which features are most important for predicting the target variable of interest. Unlike traditional feature selection methods that rely on heuristics or statistical measures, our method is trained end-to-end and can handle complex relationships among variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using simulation studies and real-world datasets, showing that FsNet outperforms other feature selection techniques while reducing computational cost and increasing interpretability. Our findings have important implications for bioinformatics researchers who must deal with large, complex datasets in their work.",1
"Transformers have become the dominant model in natural language processing, owing to their ability to pretrain on massive amounts of data, then transfer to smaller, more specific tasks via fine-tuning. The Vision Transformer was the first major attempt to apply a pure transformer model directly to images as input, demonstrating that as compared to convolutional networks, transformer-based architectures can achieve competitive results on benchmark classification tasks. However, the computational complexity of the attention operator means that we are limited to low-resolution inputs. For more complex tasks such as detection or segmentation, maintaining a high input resolution is crucial to ensure that models can properly identify and reflect fine details in their output. This naturally raises the question of whether or not transformer-based architectures such as the Vision Transformer are capable of performing tasks other than classification. In this paper, we determine that Vision Transformers can be used as a backbone by a common detection task head to produce competitive COCO results. The model that we propose, ViT-FRCNN, demonstrates several known properties associated with transformers, including large pretraining capacity and fast fine-tuning performance. We also investigate improvements over a standard detection backbone, including superior performance on out-of-domain images, better performance on large objects, and a lessened reliance on non-maximum suppression. We view ViT-FRCNN as an important stepping stone toward a pure-transformer solution of complex vision tasks such as object detection.",0

Additionally, we provide an ablation study to evaluate the impact of each component of our proposed method. In conclusion, this work advances the field of computer vision by introducing transformers as a promising alternative for object detection tasks.",1
"Modern Neural Networks are eminent in achieving state of the art performance on tasks under Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and related verticals. However, they are notorious for their voracious memory and compute appetite which further obstructs their deployment on resource limited edge devices. In order to achieve edge deployment, researchers have developed pruning and quantization algorithms to compress such networks without compromising their efficacy. Such compression algorithms are broadly experimented on standalone CNN and RNN architectures while in this work, we present an unconventional end to end compression pipeline of a CNN-LSTM based Image Captioning model. The model is trained using VGG16 or ResNet50 as an encoder and an LSTM decoder on the flickr8k dataset. We then examine the effects of different compression architectures on the model and design a compression architecture that achieves a 73.1% reduction in model size, 71.3% reduction in inference time and a 7.7% increase in BLEU score as compared to its uncompressed counterpart.",0
"Title: Efficient CNN-LSTM Based Image Captioning Using Neural Network Compression Abstract In recent years, image captioning has become one of the most popular research topics in computer vision. One of the key challenges facing the field is making these models more efficient without compromising their accuracy.

We use neural network compression techniques such as quantization and pruning to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks like COCO and Flickr8K. Additionally, we demonstrate improved speed over other existing methods by up to two times. These results indicate that our approach can provide a fast yet accurate solution for automated image description generation, thus helping drive advances in numerous applications involving image understanding.",1
"Pre-trained language models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on various text classification tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and semantic textual similarity. However, the reliability of the fine-tuned text classifiers is an often underlooked performance criterion. For instance, one may desire a model that can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples (drawn far from training distribution) or be robust against domain shifts. We claim that one central obstacle to the reliability is the over-reliance of the model on a limited number of keywords, instead of looking at the whole context. In particular, we find that (a) OOD samples often contain in-distribution keywords, while (b) cross-domain samples may not always contain keywords; over-relying on the keywords can be problematic for both cases. In light of this observation, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method, coined masked keyword regularization (MASKER), that facilitates context-based prediction. MASKER regularizes the model to reconstruct the keywords from the rest of the words and make low-confidence predictions without enough context. When applied to various pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT), we demonstrate that MASKER improves OOD detection and cross-domain generalization without degrading classification accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/alinlab/MASKER.",0
"In recent years, natural language processing has seen significant advancements due to the incorporation of deep learning techniques like neural networks. However, training these models often requires large amounts of labeled data which can be expensive and time consuming to collect. One approach to tackle this issue is to use regularization methods that improve model performance by reducing overfitting on the limited amount of available data. Recent works have shown promising results using masking techniques such as WordDropout and synonym replacement to simulate missing or alternative word tokens during training. This paper presents a novel method called Masker, which extends previous work by utilizing both contextual information and domain knowledge to generate more appropriate replacements for keywords in text data. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmark datasets. Our analysis shows that integrating external knowledge into the masking process leads to improved generalization performance, making the trained models better equipped to handle out-of-domain inputs. Overall, our findings highlight the potential benefits of integrating external knowledge sources for improving reliability in NLP applications.",1
"Image captioning transforms complex visual information into abstract natural language for representation, which can help computers understanding the world quickly. However, due to the complexity of the real environment, it needs to identify key objects and realize their connections, and further generate natural language. The whole process involves a visual understanding module and a language generation module, which brings more challenges to the design of deep neural networks than other tasks. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown its important role in a variety of image recognition tasks. Besides, RNN plays an essential role in the image captioning task. We introduce a AutoCaption method to better design the decoder module of the image captioning where we use the NAS to design the decoder module called AutoRNN automatically. We use the reinforcement learning method based on shared parameters for automatic design the AutoRNN efficiently. The search space of the AutoCaption includes connections between the layers and the operations in layers both, and it can make AutoRNN express more architectures. In particular, RNN is equivalent to a subset of our search space. Experiments on the MSCOCO datasets show that our AutoCaption model can achieve better performance than traditional hand-design methods. Our AutoCaption obtains the best published CIDEr performance of 135.8% on COCO Karpathy test split. When further using ensemble technology, CIDEr is boosted up to 139.5%.",0
"As natural language processing techniques have advanced, image captioning has become an increasingly popular task that can provide valuable insights into image content without requiring explicit annotations. Existing approaches typically involve handcrafted feature extraction from images combined with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling. In our work we propose using Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which automatically searches over a wide space of candidate architectures, allowing us to select a high-performing architecture tailored specifically to the image captioning problem. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the art methods on multiple datasets including COCO and Flickr8k and show significant improvements, indicating the potential benefits of utilizing NAS for designing neural network architectures in computer vision tasks.

"Although Transformer models such as Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT-3 are successful in many natural language processing tasks, training and deploying these models are costly and inefficient.Even if pre-trained models are used, deploying these models still remained a challenge due to their large size. Apart from deployment, these models take higher time during inference restricting user-friendliness. The main bottleneck is self-attention which uses quadratic time and space with respect to the sequence length. In order to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism, Linformer by Facebook's AI research team was introduced where they showed that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix and exploiting this finding, a new method for self-attention with linear time and space complexity was proposed by them. In the Linformer, the time complexity depends on the projection mapping dimension which acts as a hyperparameter and affects the performance of the model, tuning this hyperparameter can be time-consuming. In this paper, I proposed an alternative method for self-attention with linear complexity in time and space and is independent of the projection mapping dimension. Since this method works for long sequences this can be used for images as well as audios.",0
"Title: Improving Self-Attention Mechanisms for Transformer Models through Linear Complexity Reduction Abstract In recent years, deep learning has seen significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis, among others. This owes largely to the introduction of transformer models and their variants that have achieved state-of-the-art results on these NLP tasks. However, one major drawback of current transformer architectures is their high computational requirements, which makes them impractical for use on low-resource devices. To address this issue, we propose a modification to the popular attention mechanism used in transformers called “Linformer,” which reduces the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention operation to linear, while maintaining comparable performance. Our modifications involve replacing the softmax function, typically used for normalization, with a more efficient formulation based on Gaussian distributions. Experimental evaluation shows that our proposed model outperforms the original version of Linformer in several NLP benchmarks, including BLEU score, F1 measure, and accuracy. These promising results highlight the potential of our approach towards improving the scalability of transformer models without compromising their effectiveness.
