"Multi-objective task scheduling (MOTS) is the task scheduling while optimizing multiple and possibly contradicting constraints. A challenging extension of this problem occurs when every individual task is a multi-objective optimization problem by itself. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to complex sequential problems, its application to the MOTS domain has been stymied by two challenges. The first challenge is the inability of the DRL algorithm to ensure that every item is processed identically regardless of its position in the queue. The second challenge is the need to manage large queues, which results in large neural architectures and long training times. In this study we present MERLIN, a robust, modular and near-optimal DRL-based approach for multi-objective task scheduling. MERLIN applies a hierarchical approach to the MOTS problem by creating one neural network for the processing of individual tasks and another for the scheduling of the overall queue. In addition to being smaller and with shorted training times, the resulting architecture ensures that an item is processed in the same manner regardless of its position in the queue. Additionally, we present a novel approach for efficiently applying DRL-based solutions on very large queues, and demonstrate how we effectively scale MERLIN to process queue sizes that are larger by orders of magnitude than those on which it was trained. Extensive evaluation on multiple queue sizes show that MERLIN outperforms multiple well-known baselines by a large margin (>22%).",0

"We consider the problem of batch multi-task reinforcement learning with observed context descriptors, motivated by its application to personalized medical treatment. In particular, we study two general classes of learning algorithms: direct policy learning (DPL), an imitation-learning based approach which learns from expert trajectories, and model-based learning. First, we derive sample complexity bounds for DPL, and then show that model-based learning from expert actions can, even with a finite model class, be impossible. After relaxing the conditions under which the model-based approach is expected to learn by allowing for greater coverage of state-action space, we provide sample complexity bounds for model-based learning with finite model classes, showing that there exist model classes with sample complexity exponential in their statistical complexity. We then derive a sample complexity upper bound for model-based learning based on a measure of concentration of the data distribution. Our results give formal justification for imitation learning over model-based learning in this setting.",0

"In this paper, we introduce a new reinforcement learning (RL) based neural architecture search (NAS) methodology for effective and efficient generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture search.

"Offline reinforcement learning (RL purely from logged data) is an important avenue for deploying RL techniques in real-world scenarios. However, existing hyperparameter selection methods for offline RL break the offline assumption by evaluating policies corresponding to each hyperparameter setting in the environment. This online execution is often infeasible and hence undermines the main aim of offline RL. Therefore, in this work, we focus on \textit{offline hyperparameter selection}, i.e. methods for choosing the best policy from a set of many policies trained using different hyperparameters, given only logged data. Through large-scale empirical evaluation we show that: 1) offline RL algorithms are not robust to hyperparameter choices, 2) factors such as the offline RL algorithm and method for estimating Q values can have a big impact on hyperparameter selection, and 3) when we control those factors carefully, we can reliably rank policies across hyperparameter choices, and therefore choose policies which are close to the best policy in the set. Overall, our results present an optimistic view that offline hyperparameter selection is within reach, even in challenging tasks with pixel observations, high dimensional action spaces, and long horizon.",0
"The utilization of offline reinforcement learning (RL) from pre-recorded data is crucial for implementing RL techniques in real-life situations. However, current methods for selecting hyperparameters for offline RL violate the offline assumption by assessing policies that correspond to each hyperparameter configuration in the environment. Such online execution is often impractical, which undermines the primary objective of offline RL. Consequently, this study concentrates on selecting optimal policies from a range of policies trained using different hyperparameters, based solely on logged data, i.e., offline hyperparameter selection. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation reveals that: 1) hyperparameter choices significantly affect offline RL algorithms, 2) factors such as the offline RL algorithm and Q value estimation method can substantially impact hyperparameter selection, and 3) with careful control of these factors, we can accurately rank policies across hyperparameter choices and select policies that closely resemble the best policy in the set. In summary, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of offline hyperparameter selection, even in challenging tasks that involve pixel observations, high-dimensional action spaces, and long horizons.",1
"The act of explaining across two parties is a feedback loop, where one provides information on what needs to be explained and the other provides an explanation relevant to this information. We apply a reinforcement learning framework which emulates this format by providing explanations based on the explainee's current mental model. We conduct novel online human experiments where explanations generated by various explanation methods are selected and presented to participants, using policies which observe participants' mental models, in order to optimize an interpretability proxy. Our results suggest that mental model-based policies (anchored in our proposed state representation) may increase interpretability over multiple sequential explanations, when compared to a random selection baseline. This work provides insight into how to select explanations which increase relevant information for users, and into conducting human-grounded experimentation to understand interpretability.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning includes a broad family of algorithms that parameterise an internal representation, such as a value function or policy, by a deep neural network. Each algorithm optimises its parameters with respect to an objective, such as Q-learning or policy gradient, that defines its semantics. In this work, we propose an algorithm based on meta-gradient descent that discovers its own objective, flexibly parameterised by a deep neural network, solely from interactive experience with its environment. Over time, this allows the agent to learn how to learn increasingly effectively. Furthermore, because the objective is discovered online, it can adapt to changes over time. We demonstrate that the algorithm discovers how to address several important issues in RL, such as bootstrapping, non-stationarity, and off-policy learning. On the Atari Learning Environment, the meta-gradient algorithm adapts over time to learn with greater efficiency, eventually outperforming the median score of a strong actor-critic baseline.",0

"Applying probabilistic models to reinforcement learning (RL) enables the application of powerful optimisation tools such as variational inference to RL. However, existing inference frameworks and their algorithms pose significant challenges for learning optimal policies, e.g., the absence of mode capturing behaviour in pseudo-likelihood methods and difficulties learning deterministic policies in maximum entropy RL based approaches. We propose VIREL, a novel, theoretically grounded probabilistic inference framework for RL that utilises a parametrised action-value function to summarise future dynamics of the underlying MDP. This gives VIREL a mode-seeking form of KL divergence, the ability to learn deterministic optimal polices naturally from inference and the ability to optimise value functions and policies in separate, iterative steps. In applying variational expectation-maximisation to VIREL we thus show that the actor-critic algorithm can be reduced to expectation-maximisation, with policy improvement equivalent to an E-step and policy evaluation to an M-step. We then derive a family of actor-critic methods from VIREL, including a scheme for adaptive exploration. Finally, we demonstrate that actor-critic algorithms from this family outperform state-of-the-art methods based on soft value functions in several domains.",0

"We formulate counting as a sequential decision problem and present a novel crowd counting model solvable by deep reinforcement learning. In contrast to existing counting models that directly output count values, we divide one-step estimation into a sequence of much easier and more tractable sub-decision problems. Such sequential decision nature corresponds exactly to a physical process in reality scale weighing. Inspired by scale weighing, we propose a novel 'counting scale' termed LibraNet where the count value is analogized by weight. By virtually placing a crowd image on one side of a scale, LibraNet (agent) sequentially learns to place appropriate weights on the other side to match the crowd count. At each step, LibraNet chooses one weight (action) from the weight box (the pre-defined action pool) according to the current crowd image features and weights placed on the scale pan (state). LibraNet is required to learn to balance the scale according to the feedback of the needle (Q values). We show that LibraNet exactly implements scale weighing by visualizing the decision process how LibraNet chooses actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design choices and report state-of-the-art results on a few crowd counting benchmarks. We also demonstrate good cross-dataset generalization of LibraNet. Code and models are made available at: https://git.io/libranet",0

"The concept of utilizing multi-step returns for updating value functions has been adopted in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a number of years. Updating value functions with different backup lengths provides advantages in different aspects, including bias and variance of value estimates, convergence speed, and exploration behavior of the agent. Conventional methods such as TD-lambda leverage these advantages by using a target value equivalent to an exponential average of different step returns. Nevertheless, integrating step returns into a single target sacrifices the diversity of the advantages offered by different step return targets. To address this issue, we propose Mixture Bootstrapped DQN (MB-DQN) built on top of bootstrapped DQN, and uses different backup lengths for different bootstrapped heads. MB-DQN enables heterogeneity of the target values that is unavailable in approaches relying only on a single target value. As a result, it is able to maintain the advantages offered by different backup lengths. In this paper, we first discuss the motivational insights through a simple maze environment. In order to validate the effectiveness of MB-DQN, we perform experiments on the Atari 2600 benchmark environments, and demonstrate the performance improvement of MB-DQN over a number of baseline methods. We further provide a set of ablation studies to examine the impacts of different design configurations of MB-DQN.",0

"Fetal MRI is heavily constrained by unpredictable and substantial fetal motion that causes image artifacts and limits the set of viable diagnostic image contrasts. Current mitigation of motion artifacts is predominantly performed by fast, single-shot MRI and retrospective motion correction. Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used to fully exploit physical structure. Evaluation of this method on a repository of 3-mm resolution in vivo data demonstrates a mean accuracy of landmark estimation within 10 mm of ground truth as 87.3%, and a mean error of 6.9 mm. The proposed DRL for fetal pose landmark search demonstrates a potential clinical utility for online detection of fetal motion that guides real-time mitigation of motion artifacts as well as health diagnosis during MRI of the pregnant mother.",0

"While learning in an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), an agent should trade off exploration to discover new information about the MDP, and exploitation of the current knowledge to maximize the reward. Although the agent will eventually learn a good or optimal policy, there is no guarantee on the quality of the intermediate policies. This lack of control is undesired in real-world applications where a minimum requirement is that the executed policies are guaranteed to perform at least as well as an existing baseline. In this paper, we introduce the notion of conservative exploration for average reward and finite horizon problems. We present two optimistic algorithms that guarantee (w.h.p.) that the conservative constraint is never violated during learning. We derive regret bounds showing that being conservative does not hinder the learning ability of these algorithms.",0

"In state of the art model-free off-policy deep reinforcement learning, a replay memory is used to store past experience and derive all network updates. Even if both state and action spaces are continuous, the replay memory only holds a finite number of transitions. We represent these transitions in a data graph and link its structure to soft divergence. By selecting a subgraph with a favorable structure, we construct a simplified Markov Decision Process for which exact Q-values can be computed efficiently as more data comes in. The subgraph and its associated Q-values can be represented as a QGraph. We show that the Q-value for each transition in the simplified MDP is a lower bound of the Q-value for the same transition in the original continuous Q-learning problem. By using these lower bounds in temporal difference learning, our method QG-DDPG is less prone to soft divergence and exhibits increased sample efficiency while being more robust to hyperparameters. QGraphs also retain information from transitions that have already been overwritten in the replay memory, which can decrease the algorithm's sensitivity to the replay memory capacity.",0

Traditional control systems employ resilient/fault-tolerant controllers that counter these attacks by correcting the system via error observations. However, in some applications, a resilient controller may not be sufficient to avoid a catastrophic failure. Ideally, a robust approach is more useful in these scenarios where a system is inherently robust (by design) to adversarial attacks. While robust control has a long history of development, robust ML is an emerging research area that has already demonstrated its relevance and urgency. However, the majority of robust ML research has focused on perception tasks and not on decision and control tasks, although the ML (specifically RL) models used for control applications are equally vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that a well-performing DRL agent that is initially susceptible to action space perturbations (e.g. actuator attacks) can be robustified against similar perturbations through adversarial training.",0

"A wide range of image captioning models has been developed, achieving significant improvement based on popular metrics, such as BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, although the generated captions can accurately describe the image, they are generic for similar images and lack distinctiveness, i.e., cannot properly describe the uniqueness of each image. In this paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions through training with sets of similar images. First, we propose a distinctiveness metric -- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our metric shows that the human annotations of each image are not equivalent based on distinctiveness. Thus we propose several new training strategies to encourage the distinctiveness of the generated caption for each image, which are based on using CIDErBtw in a weighted loss function or as a reinforcement learning reward. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide variety of image captioning baselines. These results are further confirmed through a user study.",0
"Numerous models for generating image captions have been developed and have shown significant improvements according to popular metrics like BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, the captions generated tend to lack distinctiveness, meaning they are generic and cannot properly describe the unique features of each image even though they accurately depict the image. This paper aims to address this issue by proposing a distinctiveness metric, called CIDErBtw, to measure the distinctiveness of a caption with respect to similar images. The authors propose several training strategies to improve the distinctiveness of generated captions, including using CIDErBtw in a weighted loss function or as a reinforcement learning reward.

"This paper considers the problem of designing optimal algorithms for reinforcement learning in two-player zero-sum games. We focus on self-play algorithms which learn the optimal policy by playing against itself without any direct supervision. In a tabular episodic Markov game with $S$ states, $A$ max-player actions and $B$ min-player actions, the best existing algorithm for finding an approximate Nash equilibrium requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(S^2AB)$ steps of game playing, when only highlighting the dependency on $(S,A,B)$. In contrast, the best existing lower bound scales as $\Omega(S(A+B))$ and has a significant gap from the upper bound. This paper closes this gap for the first time: we propose an optimistic variant of the \emph{Nash Q-learning} algorithm with sample complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(SAB)$, and a new \emph{Nash V-learning} algorithm with sample complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(S(A+B))$. The latter result matches the information-theoretic lower bound in all problem-dependent parameters except for a polynomial factor of the length of each episode. In addition, we present a computational hardness result for learning the best responses against a fixed opponent in Markov games---a learning objective different from finding the Nash equilibrium.",0

"This paper introduces single-partition adaptive Q-learning (SPAQL), an algorithm for model-free episodic reinforcement learning (RL), which adaptively partitions the state-action space of a Markov decision process (MDP), while simultaneously learning a time-invariant policy (i. e., the mapping from states to actions does not depend explicitly on the episode time step) for maximizing the cumulative reward. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is handled by using a mixture of upper confidence bounds (UCB) and Boltzmann exploration during training, with a temperature parameter that is automatically tuned as training progresses. The algorithm is an improvement over adaptive Q-learning (AQL). It converges faster to the optimal solution, while also using fewer arms. Tests on episodes with a large number of time steps show that SPAQL has no problems scaling, unlike AQL. Based on this empirical evidence, we claim that SPAQL may have a higher sample efficiency than AQL, thus being a relevant contribution to the field of efficient model-free RL methods.",0

"Experience replay is central to off-policy algorithms in deep reinforcement learning (RL), but there remain significant gaps in our understanding. We therefore present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods, focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay -- greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory. Separately, by directly controlling the replay ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure its importance across a variety of deep RL algorithms. Finally, we conclude by testing a set of hypotheses on the nature of these performance benefits.",0

Our research challenges conventional wisdom regarding experience replay, where we found that increasing replay capacity considerably improves the performance of some algorithms, while it has no effect on others. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncorrected n-step returns, which lack theoretical grounding, are more advantageous than other techniques for sifting through larger memory. Additionally, we contextualize previous findings in the literature and measure the significance of controlling the replay ratio across various deep RL algorithms. Lastly, we test several hypotheses concerning the performance benefits of experience replay.",1
"The outcome of Jacobian singular values regularization was studied for supervised learning problems. It also was shown that Jacobian conditioning regularization can help to avoid the ``mode-collapse'' problem in Generative Adversarial Networks. In this paper, we try to answer the following question: Can information about policy conditioning help to shape a more stable and general policy of reinforcement learning agents? To answer this question, we conduct a study of Jacobian conditioning behavior during policy optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that research condition number in reinforcement learning agents. We propose a conditioning regularization algorithm and test its performance on the range of continuous control tasks. Finally, we compare algorithms on the CoinRun environment with separated train end test levels to analyze how conditioning regularization contributes to agents' generalization.",0

"One of the key approaches to save samples in reinforcement learning (RL) is to use knowledge from an approximate model such as its simulator. However, how much does an approximate model help to learn a near-optimal policy of the true unknown model? Despite numerous empirical studies of transfer reinforcement learning, an answer to this question is still elusive. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of RL while an approximate model of the environment is provided. For an unknown Markov decision process (MDP), we show that the approximate model can effectively reduce the complexity by eliminating sub-optimal actions from the policy searching space. In particular, we provide an algorithm that uses $\widetilde{O}(N/(1-\gamma)^3/\varepsilon^2)$ samples in a generative model to learn an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $N$ is the number of near-optimal actions in the approximate model. This can be much smaller than the learning-from-scratch complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}(SA/(1-\gamma)^3/\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of state and action spaces respectively. We also provide a lower bound showing that the above upper bound is nearly-tight if the value gap between near-optimal actions and sub-optimal actions in the approximate model is sufficiently large. Our results provide a very precise characterization of how an approximate model helps reinforcement learning when no additional assumption on the model is posed.",0

"A common assumption in reinforcement learning (RL) is to have access to a generative model (i.e., a simulator of the environment), which allows to generate samples from any desired state-action pair. Nonetheless, in many settings a generative model may not be available and an adaptive exploration strategy is needed to efficiently collect samples from an unknown environment by direct interaction. In this paper, we study the scenario where an algorithm based on the generative model assumption defines the (possibly time-varying) amount of samples $b(s,a)$ required at each state-action pair $(s,a)$ and an exploration strategy has to learn how to generate $b(s,a)$ samples as fast as possible. Building on recent results for regret minimization in the stochastic shortest path (SSP) setting (Cohen et al., 2020; Tarbouriech et al., 2020), we derive an algorithm that requires $\tilde{O}( B D + D^{3/2} S^2 A)$ time steps to collect the $B = \sum_{s,a} b(s,a)$ desired samples, in any unknown and communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions and diameter $D$. Leveraging the generality of our strategy, we readily apply it to a variety of existing settings (e.g., model estimation, pure exploration in MDPs) for which we obtain improved sample-complexity guarantees, and to a set of new problems such as best-state identification and sparse reward discovery.",0

"Off-policy evaluation of sequential decision policies from observational data is necessary in applications of batch reinforcement learning such as education and healthcare. In such settings, however, unobserved variables confound observed actions, rendering exact evaluation of new policies impossible, i.e., unidentifiable. We develop a robust approach that estimates sharp bounds on the (unidentifiable) value of a given policy in an infinite-horizon problem given data from another policy with unobserved confounding, subject to a sensitivity model. We consider stationary or baseline unobserved confounding and compute bounds by optimizing over the set of all stationary state-occupancy ratios that agree with a new partially identified estimating equation and the sensitivity model. We prove convergence to the sharp bounds as we collect more confounded data. Although checking set membership is a linear program, the support function is given by a difficult nonconvex optimization problem. We develop approximations based on nonconvex projected gradient descent and demonstrate the resulting bounds empirically.",0

"As a popular meta-learning approach, the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the convergence of the general multi-step MAML still remains unexplored. In this paper, we develop a new theoretical framework to provide such convergence guarantee for two types of objective functions that are of interest in practice: (a) resampling case (e.g., reinforcement learning), where loss functions take the form in expectation and new data are sampled as the algorithm runs; and (b) finite-sum case (e.g., supervised learning), where loss functions take the finite-sum form with given samples. For both cases, we characterize the convergence rate and the computational complexity to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate solution for multi-step MAML in the general nonconvex setting. In particular, our results suggest that an inner-stage stepsize needs to be chosen inversely proportional to the number $N$ of inner-stage steps in order for $N$-step MAML to have guaranteed convergence. From the technical perspective, we develop novel techniques to deal with the nested structure of the meta gradient for multi-step MAML, which can be of independent interest.",0

"In this paper, we build upon the weakly-supervised generation mechanism of intermediate attention maps in any convolutional neural networks and disclose the effectiveness of attention modules more straightforwardly to fully exploit their potential. Given an existing neural network equipped with arbitrary attention modules, we introduce a meta critic network to evaluate the quality of attention maps in the main network. Due to the discreteness of our designed reward, the proposed learning method is arranged in a reinforcement learning setting, where the attention actors and recurrent critics are alternately optimized to provide instant critique and revision for the temporary attention representation, hence coined as Deep REinforced Attention Learning (DREAL). It could be applied universally to network architectures with different types of attention modules and promotes their expressive ability by maximizing the relative gain of the final recognition performance arising from each individual attention module, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on both category and instance recognition benchmarks.",0

"Multi-step greedy policies have been extensively used in model-based reinforcement learning (RL), both when a model of the environment is available (e.g.,~in the game of Go) and when it is learned. In this paper, we explore their benefits in model-free RL, when employed using multi-step dynamic programming algorithms: $\kappa$-Policy Iteration ($\kappa$-PI) and $\kappa$-Value Iteration ($\kappa$-VI). These methods iteratively compute the next policy ($\kappa$-PI) and value function ($\kappa$-VI) by solving a surrogate decision problem with a shaped reward and a smaller discount factor. We derive model-free RL algorithms based on $\kappa$-PI and $\kappa$-VI in which the surrogate problem can be solved by any discrete or continuous action RL method, such as DQN and TRPO. We identify the importance of a hyper-parameter that controls the extent to which the surrogate problem is solved and suggest a way to set this parameter. When evaluated on a range of Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks, our results indicate that for the right range of $\kappa$, our algorithms outperform DQN and TRPO.

"To efficiently run DNNs on the edge/cloud, many new DNN inference accelerators are being designed and deployed frequently. To enhance the resource efficiency of DNNs, model quantization is a widely-used approach. However, different accelerator/HW has different resources leading to the need for specialized quantization strategy of each HW. Moreover, using the same quantization for every layer may be sub-optimal, increasing the designspace of possible quantization choices. This makes manual-tuning infeasible. Recent work in automatically determining quantization for each layer is driven by optimization methods such as reinforcement learning. However, these approaches need re-training the RL for every new HW platform. We propose a new way for autonomous quantization and HW-aware tuning. We propose a generative model, AQGAN, which takes a target accuracy as the condition and generates a suite of quantization configurations. With the conditional generative model, the user can autonomously generate different configurations with different targets in inference time. Moreover, we propose a simplified HW-tuning flow, which uses the generative model to generate proposals and execute simple selection based on the HW resource budget, whose process is fast and interactive. We evaluate our model on five of the widely-used efficient models on the ImageNet dataset. We compare with existing uniform quantization and state-of-the-art autonomous quantization methods. Our generative model shows competitive achieved accuracy, however, with around two degrees less search cost for each design point.

"The choice of the control frequency of a system has a relevant impact on the ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn a highly performing policy.

We start analyzing how action persistence affects the performance of the optimal policy, and then we present a novel algorithm, Persistent Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI), that extends FQI, with the goal of learning the optimal value function at a given persistence.

"We analyze the Gambler's problem, a simple reinforcement learning problem where the gambler has the chance to double or lose the bets until the target is reached. This is an early example introduced in the reinforcement learning textbook by Sutton and Barto (2018), where they mention an interesting pattern of the optimal value function with high-frequency components and repeating non-smooth points. It is however without further investigation. We provide the exact formula for the optimal value function for both the discrete and the continuous cases. Though simple as it might seem, the value function is pathological: fractal, self-similar, derivative taking either zero or infinity, and not written as elementary functions. It is in fact one of the generalized Cantor functions, where it holds a complexity that has been uncharted thus far. Our analyses could provide insights into improving value function approximation, gradient-based algorithms, and Q-learning, in real applications and implementations.",0

"Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because (i) it enables planning and thus more strategic exploration, and (ii) by decoupling dynamics from rewards, it enables fast transfer to new reward functions. However, learning an accurate Markov Decision Process (MDP) over high-dimensional states (e.g., raw pixels) is extremely challenging because it requires function approximation, which leads to compounding errors. Instead, to avoid compounding errors, we propose learning an abstract MDP over abstract states: low-dimensional coarse representations of the state (e.g., capturing agent position, ignoring other objects). We assume access to an abstraction function that maps the concrete states to abstract states. In our approach, we construct an abstract MDP, which grows through strategic exploration via planning. Similar to hierarchical RL approaches, the abstract actions of the abstract MDP are backed by learned subpolicies that navigate between abstract states. Our approach achieves strong results on three of the hardest Arcade Learning Environment games (Montezuma's Revenge, Pitfall!, and Private Eye), including superhuman performance on Pitfall! without demonstrations. After training on one task, we can reuse the learned abstract MDP for new reward functions, achieving higher reward in 1000x fewer samples than model-free methods trained from scratch.",0

"The field of reinforcement learning can be split into model-based and model-free methods. Here, we unify these approaches by casting model-free policy optimisation as amortised variational inference, and model-based planning as iterative variational inference, within a `control as hybrid inference' (CHI) framework. We present an implementation of CHI which naturally mediates the balance between iterative and amortised inference. Using a didactic experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm operates in a model-based manner at the onset of learning, before converging to a model-free algorithm once sufficient data have been collected. We verify the scalability of our algorithm on a continuous control benchmark, demonstrating that it outperforms strong model-free and model-based baselines. CHI thus provides a principled framework for harnessing the sample efficiency of model-based planning while retaining the asymptotic performance of model-free policy optimisation.",0

We propose a multi-exit evacuation simulation based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), referred to as the MultiExit-DRL, which involves in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework to facilitate state-to-action mapping. The DNN framework applies Rainbow Deep Q-Network (DQN), a DRL algorithm that integrates several advanced DQN methods, to improve data utilization and algorithm stability, and further divides the action space into eight isometric directions for possible pedestrian choices. We compare MultiExit-DRL with two conventional multi-exit evacuation simulation models in three separate scenarios: 1) varying pedestrian distribution ratios, 2) varying exit width ratios, and 3) varying open schedules for an exit. The results show that MultiExit-DRL presents great learning efficiency while reducing the total number of evacuation frames in all designed experiments. In addition, the integration of DRL allows pedestrians to explore other potential exits and helps determine optimal directions, leading to the high efficiency of exit utilization.",0
"The current approach to simulating indoor evacuation with multiple exits focuses on determining the most suitable exit based on several factors in a dynamic environment. However, these simulations often result in some exits being overcrowded while others are underutilized, especially in situations with a large number of pedestrians.

"Edge devices demand low energy consumption, cost and small form factor. To efficiently deploy convolutional neural network (CNN) models on edge device, energy-aware model compression becomes extremely important. However, existing work did not study this problem well because the lack of considering the diversity of dataflow types in hardware architectures. In this paper, we propose EDCompress, an Energy-aware model compression method for various Dataflows. It can effectively reduce the energy consumption of various edge devices, with different dataflow types. Considering the very nature of model compression procedures, we recast the optimization process to a multi-step problem, and solve it by reinforcement learning algorithms. Experiments show that EDCompress could improve 20X, 17X, 37X energy efficiency in VGG-16, MobileNet, LeNet-5 networks, respectively, with negligible loss of accuracy. EDCompress could also find the optimal dataflow type for specific neural networks in terms of energy consumption, which can guide the deployment of CNN models on hardware systems.",0

"In this work, we propose a novel approach for reinforcement learning driven by evolutionary computation. Our algorithm, dubbed as Evolutionary-Driven Reinforcement Learning (evo-RL), embeds the reinforcement learning algorithm in an evolutionary cycle, where we distinctly differentiate between purely evolvable (instinctive) behaviour versus purely learnable behaviour. Furthermore, we propose that this distinction is decided by the evolutionary process, thus allowing evo-RL to be adaptive to different environments. In addition, evo-RL facilitates learning on environments with rewardless states, which makes it more suited for real-world problems with incomplete information. To show that evo-RL leads to state-of-the-art performance, we present the performance of different state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms when operating within evo-RL and compare it with the case when these same algorithms are executed independently. Results show that reinforcement learning algorithms embedded within our evo-RL approach significantly outperform the stand-alone versions of the same RL algorithms on OpenAI Gym control problems with rewardless states constrained by the same computational budget.",0

"This paper investigates generalisation in multi-agent games, where the generality of the agent can be evaluated by playing against opponents it hasn't seen during training. We propose two new games with concealed information and complex, non-transitive reward structure (think rock/paper/scissors). It turns out that most current deep reinforcement learning methods fail to efficiently explore the strategy space, thus learning policies that generalise poorly to unseen opponents. We then propose a novel hierarchical agent architecture, where the hierarchy is grounded in the game-theoretic structure of the game -- the top level chooses strategic responses to opponents, while the low level implements them into policy over primitive actions. This grounding facilitates credit assignment across the levels of hierarchy. Our experiments show that the proposed hierarchical agent is capable of generalisation to unseen opponents, while conventional baselines fail to generalise whatsoever.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically start tabula rasa, without any prior knowledge of the environment, and without any prior skills. This however often leads to low sample efficiency, requiring a large amount of interaction with the environment. This is especially true in a lifelong learning setting, in which the agent needs to continually extend its capabilities. In this paper, we examine how a pre-trained task-independent language model can make a goal-conditional RL agent more sample efficient. We do this by facilitating transfer learning between different related tasks. We experimentally demonstrate our approach on a set of object navigation tasks.",0

"In face recognition, designing margin-based (e.g., angular, additive, additive angular margins) softmax loss functions plays an important role in learning discriminative features. However, these hand-crafted heuristic methods are sub-optimal because they require much effort to explore the large design space. Recently, an AutoML for loss function search method AM-LFS has been derived, which leverages reinforcement learning to search loss functions during the training process. But its search space is complex and unstable that hindering its superiority. In this paper, we first analyze that the key to enhance the feature discrimination is actually \textbf{how to reduce the softmax probability}. We then design a unified formulation for the current margin-based softmax losses. Accordingly, we define a novel search space and develop a reward-guided search method to automatically obtain the best candidate. Experimental results on a variety of face recognition benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art alternatives.",0

"Reinforcement learning is typically concerned with learning control policies tailored to a particular agent. We investigate whether there exists a single global policy that can generalize to control a wide variety of agent morphologies -- ones in which even dimensionality of state and action spaces changes. We propose to express this global policy as a collection of identical modular neural networks, dubbed as Shared Modular Policies (SMP), that correspond to each of the agent's actuators. Every module is only responsible for controlling its corresponding actuator and receives information from only its local sensors. In addition, messages are passed between modules, propagating information between distant modules. We show that a single modular policy can successfully generate locomotion behaviors for several planar agents with different skeletal structures such as monopod hoppers, quadrupeds, bipeds, and generalize to variants not seen during training -- a process that would normally require training and manual hyperparameter tuning for each morphology. We observe that a wide variety of drastically diverse locomotion styles across morphologies as well as centralized coordination emerges via message passing between decentralized modules purely from the reinforcement learning objective.

"Self-play, where the algorithm learns by playing against itself without requiring any direct supervision, has become the new weapon in modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) for achieving superhuman performance in practice. However, the majority of exisiting theory in reinforcement learning only applies to the setting where the agent plays against a fixed environment; it remains largely open whether self-play algorithms can be provably effective, especially when it is necessary to manage the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. We study self-play in competitive reinforcement learning under the setting of Markov games, a generalization of Markov decision processes to the two-player case. We introduce a self-play algorithm---Value Iteration with Upper/Lower Confidence Bound (VI-ULCB)---and show that it achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ after playing $T$ steps of the game, where the regret is measured by the agent's performance against a \emph{fully adversarial} opponent who can exploit the agent's strategy at \emph{any} step. We also introduce an explore-then-exploit style algorithm, which achieves a slightly worse regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, but is guaranteed to run in polynomial time even in the worst case.

"Training an agent to solve control tasks directly from high-dimensional images with model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has proven difficult. A promising approach is to learn a latent representation together with the control policy. However, fitting a high-capacity encoder using a scarce reward signal is sample inefficient and leads to poor performance. Prior work has shown that auxiliary losses, such as image reconstruction, can aid efficient representation learning. However, incorporating reconstruction loss into an off-policy learning algorithm often leads to training instability. We explore the underlying reasons and identify variational autoencoders, used by previous investigations, as the cause of the divergence. Following these findings, we propose effective techniques to improve training stability. This results in a simple approach capable of matching state-of-the-art model-free and model-based algorithms on MuJoCo control tasks.

"Continuous control tasks in reinforcement learning are important because they provide an important framework for learning in high-dimensional state spaces with deceptive rewards, where the agent can easily become trapped into suboptimal solutions. One way to avoid local optima is to use a population of agents to ensure coverage of the policy space, yet learning a population with the ""best"" coverage is still an open problem. In this work, we present a novel approach to population-based RL in continuous control that leverages properties of normalizing flows to perform attractive and repulsive operations between current members of the population and previously observed policies. Empirical results on the MuJoCo suite demonstrate a high performance gain for our algorithm compared to prior work, including Soft-Actor Critic (SAC).",0

We show a reduction of almost $35\%$ in the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per pass, with no degradation in performance. Further, our method can successfully regularize randomly wired neural networks based on purely structural properties, and also find that the favourable characteristics identified in one network generalise to other networks.

"Existing work on risk-sensitive reinforcement learning - both for symmetric and downside risk measures - has typically used direct Monte-Carlo estimation of policy gradients. While this approach yields unbiased gradient estimates, it also suffers from high variance and decreased sample efficiency compared to temporal-difference methods. In this paper, we study prediction and control with aversion to downside risk which we gauge by the lower partial moment of the return. We introduce a new Bellman equation that upper bounds the lower partial moment, circumventing its non-linearity. We prove that this proxy for the lower partial moment is a contraction, and provide intuition into the stability of the algorithm by variance decomposition. This allows sample-efficient, on-line estimation of partial moments. For risk-sensitive control, we instantiate Reward Constrained Policy Optimization, a recent actor-critic method for finding constrained policies, with our proxy for the lower partial moment. We extend the method to use natural policy gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three benchmark problems for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.",0

"Sample complexity bounds are a common performance metric in the Reinforcement Learning literature. In the discounted cost, infinite horizon setting, all of the known bounds have a factor that is a polynomial in $1/(1-\gamma)$, where $\gamma < 1$ is the discount factor. For a large discount factor, these bounds seem to imply that a very large number of samples is required to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. The objective of the present work is to introduce a new class of algorithms that have sample complexity uniformly bounded for all $\gamma < 1$. One may argue that this is impossible, due to a recent min-max lower bound. The explanation is that this previous lower bound is for a specific problem, which we modify, without compromising the ultimate objective of obtaining an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. Specifically, we show that the asymptotic covariance of the Q-learning algorithm with an optimized step-size sequence is a quadratic function of $1/(1-\gamma)$; an expected, and essentially known result. The new relative Q-learning algorithm proposed here is shown to have asymptotic covariance that is a quadratic in $1/(1- \rho^* \gamma)$, where $1 - \rho^* > 0$ is an upper bound on the spectral gap of an optimal transition matrix.",0

"Formation mechanisms are fundamental to the study of complex networks, but learning them from observations is challenging. In real-world domains, one often has access only to the final constructed graph, instead of the full construction process, and observed graphs exhibit complex structural properties. In this work, we propose GraphOpt, an end-to-end framework that jointly learns an implicit model of graph structure formation and discovers an underlying optimization mechanism in the form of a latent objective function. The learned objective can serve as an explanation for the observed graph properties, thereby lending itself to transfer across different graphs within a domain. GraphOpt poses link formation in graphs as a sequential decision-making process and solves it using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. Further, it employs a novel continuous latent action space that aids scalability.

"The study of complex networks requires an understanding of their formation mechanisms, but learning these mechanisms from observations can be difficult. Often, only the final constructed graph is available, and observed graphs have intricate structural properties. Our work proposes GraphOpt, an end-to-end framework that simultaneously learns a model of graph formation and discovers an optimization mechanism through a latent objective function. This objective function can explain the observed graph properties and can be transferred to other graphs in the same domain. GraphOpt approaches link formation as a sequential decision-making process and uses a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. It also utilizes a novel continuous latent action space to improve scalability. Our empirical results demonstrate that GraphOpt can discover a transferable latent objective function and a robust stochastic policy that achieves competitive link prediction performance. Additionally, it can construct graphs with similar properties to the observed graph without explicit training for this task.",1
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance in many complex environments due to the integration with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). At the same time, Genetic Algorithms (GAs), often seen as a competing approach to RL, had limited success in scaling up to the DNNs required to solve challenging tasks. Contrary to this dichotomic view, in the physical world, evolution and learning are complementary processes that continuously interact. The recently proposed Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework has demonstrated mutual benefits to performance when combining the two methods. However, ERL has not fully addressed the scalability problem of GAs. In this paper, we show that this problem is rooted in an unfortunate combination of a simple genetic encoding for DNNs and the use of traditional biologically-inspired variation operators. When applied to these encodings, the standard operators are destructive and cause catastrophic forgetting of the traits the networks acquired. We propose a novel algorithm called Proximal Distilled Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (PDERL) that is characterised by a hierarchical integration between evolution and learning. The main innovation of PDERL is the use of learning-based variation operators that compensate for the simplicity of the genetic representation. Unlike traditional operators, our proposals meet the functional requirements of variation operators when applied on directly-encoded DNNs. We evaluate PDERL in five robot locomotion settings from the OpenAI gym. Our method outperforms ERL, as well as two state-of-the-art RL algorithms, PPO and TD3, in all tested environments.",0

"Failure of mission-critical equipment interrupts production and results in monetary loss. The risk of unplanned equipment downtime can be minimized through Predictive Maintenance of revenue generating assets to ensure optimal performance and safe operation of equipment. However, the increased sensorization of the equipment generates a data deluge, and existing machine-learning based predictive model alone becomes inadequate for timely equipment condition predictions. In this paper, a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is proposed for predictive equipment maintenance from an equipment-based sensor network context. Within each equipment, a sensor device aggregates raw sensor data, and the equipment health status is analyzed for anomalous events. Unlike traditional black-box regression models, the proposed algorithm self-learns an optimal maintenance policy and provides actionable recommendation for each equipment. Our experimental results demonstrate the potential for broader range of equipment maintenance applications as an automatic learning framework.",0

"Radio Frequency powered Cognitive Radio Networks (RF-CRN) are likely to be the eyes and ears of upcoming modern networks such as Internet of Things (IoT), requiring increased decentralization and autonomous operation. To be considered autonomous, the RF-powered network entities need to make decisions locally to maximize the network throughput under the uncertainty of any network environment. However, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are usually large, and existing Tabular Reinforcement Learning technique is unable to find the optimal state-action policy quickly.

"Distances are pervasive in machine learning. They serve as similarity measures, loss functions, and learning targets; it is said that a good distance measure solves a task. When defining distances, the triangle inequality has proven to be a useful constraint, both theoretically--to prove convergence and optimality guarantees--and empirically--as an inductive bias. Deep metric learning architectures that respect the triangle inequality rely, almost exclusively, on Euclidean distance in the latent space. Though effective, this fails to model two broad classes of subadditive distances, common in graphs and reinforcement learning: asymmetric metrics, and metrics that cannot be embedded into Euclidean space. To address these problems, we introduce novel architectures that are guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality. We prove our architectures universally approximate norm-induced metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and present a similar result for modified Input Convex Neural Networks. We show that our architectures outperform existing metric approaches when modeling graph distances and have a better inductive bias than non-metric approaches when training data is limited in the multi-goal reinforcement learning setting.",0

"While policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) achieves tremendous successes in practice, it is significantly less understood in theory, especially compared with value-based RL. In particular, it remains elusive how to design a provably efficient policy optimization algorithm that incorporates exploration. To bridge such a gap, this paper proposes an Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (OPPO), which follows an ``optimistic version'' of the policy gradient direction. This paper proves that, in the problem of episodic Markov decision process with linear function approximation, unknown transition, and adversarial reward with full-information feedback, OPPO achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2 H^3 T} )$ regret. Here $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the episode horizon, and $T$ is the total number of steps.

"What goals should a multi-goal reinforcement learning agent pursue during training in long-horizon tasks? When the desired (test time) goal distribution is too distant to offer a useful learning signal, we argue that the agent should not pursue unobtainable goals. Instead, it should set its own intrinsic goals that maximize the entropy of the historical achieved goal distribution. We propose to optimize this objective by having the agent pursue past achieved goals in sparsely explored areas of the goal space, which focuses exploration on the frontier of the achievable goal set. We show that our strategy achieves an order of magnitude better sample efficiency than the prior state of the art on long-horizon multi-goal tasks including maze navigation and block stacking.",0

"We investigate whether Jacobi preconditioning, accounting for the bootstrap term in temporal difference (TD) learning, can help boost performance of adaptive optimizers. Our method, TDprop, computes a per parameter learning rate based on the diagonal preconditioning of the TD update rule. We show how this can be used in both $n$-step returns and TD($\lambda$). Our theoretical findings demonstrate that including this additional preconditioning information is, surprisingly, comparable to normal semi-gradient TD if the optimal learning rate is found for both via a hyperparameter search. In Deep RL experiments using Expected SARSA, TDprop meets or exceeds the performance of Adam in all tested games under near-optimal learning rates, but a well-tuned SGD can yield similar improvements -- matching our theory. Our findings suggest that Jacobi preconditioning may improve upon typical adaptive optimization methods in Deep RL, but despite incorporating additional information from the TD bootstrap term, may not always be better than SGD.",0

"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) systems with general goals beyond a cumulative sum of rewards have gained traction, such as in constrained problems, exploration, and acting upon prior experiences. In this paper, we consider policy optimization in Markov Decision Problems, where the objective is a general concave utility function of the state-action occupancy measure, which subsumes several of the aforementioned examples as special cases. Such generality invalidates the Bellman equation. As this means that dynamic programming no longer works, we focus on direct policy search. Analogously to the Policy Gradient Theorem \cite{sutton2000policy} available for RL with cumulative rewards, we derive a new Variational Policy Gradient Theorem for RL with general utilities, which establishes that the parametrized policy gradient may be obtained as the solution of a stochastic saddle point problem involving the Fenchel dual of the utility function. We develop a variational Monte Carlo gradient estimation algorithm to compute the policy gradient based on sample paths. We prove that the variational policy gradient scheme converges globally to the optimal policy for the general objective, though the optimization problem is nonconvex. We also establish its rate of convergence of the order $O(1/t)$ by exploiting the hidden convexity of the problem, and proves that it converges exponentially when the problem admits hidden strong convexity. Our analysis applies to the standard RL problem with cumulative rewards as a special case, in which case our result improves the available convergence rate.",0

"Value-based methods constitute a fundamental methodology in planning and deep reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we propose to exploit the underlying structures of the state-action value function, i.e., Q function, for both planning and deep RL. In particular, if the underlying system dynamics lead to some global structures of the Q function, one should be capable of inferring the function better by leveraging such structures. Specifically, we investigate the low-rank structure, which widely exists for big data matrices. We verify empirically the existence of low-rank Q functions in the context of control and deep RL tasks. As our key contribution, by leveraging Matrix Estimation (ME) techniques, we propose a general framework to exploit the underlying low-rank structure in Q functions. This leads to a more efficient planning procedure for classical control, and additionally, a simple scheme that can be applied to any value-based RL techniques to consistently achieve better performance on ""low-rank"" tasks. Extensive experiments on control tasks and Atari games confirm the efficacy of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/YyzHarry/SV-RL.",0

"Specifying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task involves choosing a suitable planning horizon, which is typically modeled by a discount factor. It is known that applying RL algorithms with a lower discount factor can act as a regularizer, improving performance in the limited data regime. Yet the exact nature of this regularizer has not been investigated. In this work, we fill in this gap. For several Temporal-Difference (TD) learning methods, we show an explicit equivalence between using a reduced discount factor and adding an explicit regularization term to the algorithm's loss. Motivated by the equivalence, we empirically study this technique compared to standard $L_2$ regularization by extensive experiments in discrete and continuous domains, using tabular and functional representations. Our experiments suggest the regularization effectiveness is strongly related to properties of the available data, such as size, distribution, and mixing rate.",0

"The principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty underpins many theoretically successful reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper we provide a general framework for designing, analyzing and implementing such algorithms in the episodic reinforcement learning problem. This framework is built upon Lagrangian duality, and demonstrates that every model-optimistic algorithm that constructs an optimistic MDP has an equivalent representation as a value-optimistic dynamic programming algorithm. Typically, it was thought that these two classes of algorithms were distinct, with model-optimistic algorithms benefiting from a cleaner probabilistic analysis while value-optimistic algorithms are easier to implement and thus more practical. With the framework developed in this paper, we show that it is possible to get the best of both worlds by providing a class of algorithms which have a computationally efficient dynamic-programming implementation and also a simple probabilistic analysis. Besides being able to capture many existing algorithms in the tabular setting, our framework can also address largescale problems under realizable function approximation, where it enables a simple model-based analysis of some recently proposed methods.",0

In this paper, we assess the generalization performance of these algorithms by leveraging high-dimensional, procedurally generated environments. We find that these algorithms can display strong overfitting when they are evaluated on challenging tasks. We also observe that scalability to high-dimensional tasks with sparse rewards remains a significant problem among many of the current meta-reinforcement learning algorithms.

"The construction of replication strategies for contingent claims in the presence of risk and market friction is a key problem of financial engineering. In real markets, continuous replication, such as in the model of Black, Scholes and Merton, is not only unrealistic but it is also undesirable due to high transaction costs. Over the last decades stochastic optimal-control methods have been developed to balance between effective replication and losses. More recently, with the rise of artificial intelligence, temporal-difference Reinforcement Learning, in particular variations of $Q$-learning in conjunction with Deep Neural Networks, have attracted significant interest. From a practical point of view, however, such methods are often relatively sample inefficient, hard to train and lack performance guarantees. This motivates the investigation of a stable benchmark algorithm for hedging. In this article, the hedging problem is viewed as an instance of a risk-averse contextual $k$-armed bandit problem, for which a large body of theoretical results and well-studied algorithms are available. We find that the $k$-armed bandit model naturally fits to the $P\&L$ formulation of hedging, providing for a more accurate and sample efficient approach than $Q$-learning and reducing to the Black-Scholes model in the absence of transaction costs and risks.",0

"Option discovery and skill acquisition frameworks are integral to the functioning of a Hierarchically organized Reinforcement learning agent. However, such techniques often yield a large number of options or skills, which can potentially be represented succinctly by filtering out any redundant information. Such a reduction can reduce the required computation while also improving the performance on a target task. In order to compress an array of option policies, we attempt to find a policy basis that accurately captures the set of all options. In this work, we propose Option Encoder, an auto-encoder based framework with intelligently constrained weights, that helps discover a collection of basis policies. The policy basis can be used as a proxy for the original set of skills in a suitable hierarchically organized framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a collection of grid-worlds and on the high-dimensional Fetch-Reach robotic manipulation task by evaluating the obtained policy basis on a set of downstream tasks.",0

"In optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes of retina, the sequential acquisition of the individual slices makes this modality prone to motion artifacts, misalignments between adjacent slices being the most noticeable. Any distortion in OCT volumes can bias structural analysis and influence the outcome of longitudinal studies. On the other hand, presence of speckle noise that is characteristic of this imaging modality, leads to inaccuracies when traditional registration techniques are employed. Also, the lack of a well-defined ground truth makes supervised deep-learning techniques ill-posed to tackle the problem. In this paper, we tackle these issues by using deep reinforcement learning to correct inter-frame movements in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we use dueling deep Q-network to train an artificial agent to find the optimal policy, i.e. a sequence of actions, that best improves the alignment by maximizing the sum of reward signals. Instead of relying on the ground-truth of transformation parameters to guide the rewarding system, for the first time, we use a combination of intensity based image similarity metrics. Further, to avoid the agent bias towards speckle noise, we ensure the agent can see retinal layers as part of the interacting environment. For quantitative evaluation, we simulate the eye movement artifacts by applying 2D rigid transformations on individual B-scans. The proposed model achieves an average of 0.985 and 0.914 for normalized mutual information and correlation coefficient, respectively. We also compare our model with elastix intensity based medical image registration approach, where significant improvement is achieved by our model for both noisy and denoised volumes.",0

"Deployments of Bayesian Optimization (BO) for functions with stochastic evaluations, such as parameter tuning via cross validation and simulation optimization, typically optimize an average of a fixed set of noisy realizations of the objective function. However, disregarding the true objective function in this manner finds a high-precision optimum of the wrong function. To solve this problem, we propose Bayesian Optimization by Sampling Hierarchically (BOSH), a novel BO routine pairing a hierarchical Gaussian process with an information-theoretic framework to generate a growing pool of realizations as the optimization progresses.

"Resolving the exploration-exploitation trade-off remains a fundamental problem in the design and implementation of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In this paper, we focus on model-free RL using the epsilon-greedy exploration policy, which despite its simplicity, remains one of the most frequently used forms of exploration. However, a key limitation of this policy is the specification of $\varepsilon$. In this paper, we provide a novel Bayesian perspective of $\varepsilon$ as a measure of the uniformity of the Q-value function. We introduce a closed-form Bayesian model update based on Bayesian model combination (BMC), based on this new perspective, which allows us to adapt $\varepsilon$ using experiences from the environment in constant time with monotone convergence guarantees.

Our focus in this study is on model-free RL, which commonly employs the epsilon-greedy exploration policy. However, a major issue with this policy is the need to specify the value of epsilon. To address this, we introduce a Bayesian perspective that views epsilon as a measure of the uniformity of the Q-value function. Using Bayesian model combination (BMC), we develop a closed-form Bayesian model update that enables us to adapt epsilon in constant time with monotone convergence guarantees. Our proposed algorithm, epsilon-BMC, effectively balances exploration and exploitation on diverse problems and achieves comparable or superior results to the best tuned fixed annealing schedules and a data-dependent epsilon adaptation scheme from prior research.",1
"We are interested in how to design reinforcement learning agents that provably reduce the sample complexity for learning new tasks by transferring knowledge from previously-solved ones. The availability of solutions to related problems poses a fundamental trade-off: whether to seek policies that are expected to achieve high (yet sub-optimal) performance in the new task immediately or whether to seek information to quickly identify an optimal solution, potentially at the cost of poor initial behavior. In this work, we focus on the second objective when the agent has access to a generative model of state-action pairs. First, given a set of solved tasks containing an approximation of the target one, we design an algorithm that quickly identifies an accurate solution by seeking the state-action pairs that are most informative for this purpose. We derive PAC bounds on its sample complexity which clearly demonstrate the benefits of using this kind of prior knowledge. Then, we show how to learn these approximate tasks sequentially by reducing our transfer setting to a hidden Markov model and employing spectral methods to recover its parameters. Finally, we empirically verify our theoretical findings in simple simulated domains.",0
"Our focus is on creating reinforcement learning agents that can effectively learn new tasks by leveraging knowledge gained from previously-solved ones, while reducing the sample complexity. However, the availability of related solutions presents a challenge - should the agent prioritize quick performance in the new task, even if it is suboptimal, or should it take time to identify an optimal solution, potentially at the cost of poor initial behavior? In this study, we prioritize the latter approach, assuming that the agent has access to a generative model of state-action pairs. Our algorithm seeks out the most informative state-action pairs to quickly identify an accurate solution based on a set of solved tasks that approximate the target task. We derive PAC bounds to demonstrate the advantages of this approach. We also demonstrate how to learn these approximate tasks sequentially using spectral methods to recover hidden Markov model parameters.

"High dimensional black-box optimization has broad applications but remains a challenging problem to solve. Given a set of samples $\{\vx_i, y_i\}$, building a global model (like Bayesian Optimization (BO)) suffers from the curse of dimensionality in the high-dimensional search space, while a greedy search may lead to sub-optimality. By recursively splitting the search space into regions with high/low function values, recent works like LaNAS shows good performance in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), reducing the sample complexity empirically. In this paper, we coin LA-MCTS that extends LaNAS to other domains. Unlike previous approaches, LA-MCTS learns the partition of the search space using a few samples and their function values in an online fashion. While LaNAS uses linear partition and performs uniform sampling in each region, our LA-MCTS adopts a nonlinear decision boundary and learns a local model to pick good candidates. If the nonlinear partition function and the local model fits well with ground-truth black-box function, then good partitions and candidates can be reached with much fewer samples. LA-MCTS serves as a \emph{meta-algorithm} by using existing black-box optimizers (e.g., BO, TuRBO) as its local models, achieving strong performance in general black-box optimization and reinforcement learning benchmarks, in particular for high-dimensional problems.",0

"Accurate and reliable prediction of hospital admission location is important due to resource-constraints and space availability in a clinical setting, particularly when dealing with patients who come from the emergency department. In this work we propose a student-teacher network via reinforcement learning to deal with this specific problem. A representation of the weights of the student network is treated as the state and is fed as an input to the teacher network. The teacher network's action is to select the most appropriate batch of data to train the student network on from a training set sorted according to entropy. By validating on three datasets, not only do we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tabular data and performs competitively on image recognition, but also that novel curricula are learned by the teacher network. We demonstrate experimentally that the teacher network can actively learn about the student network and guide it to achieve better performance than if trained alone.",0

"This paper proposes the Cooperative Soft Actor Critic (CSAC) method of enabling consecutive reinforcement learning agents to cooperatively solve a long time horizon multi-stage task. This method is achieved by modifying the policy of each agent to maximise both the current and next agent's critic. Cooperatively maximising each agent's critic allows each agent to take actions that are beneficial for its task as well as subsequent tasks. Using this method in a multi-room maze domain, the cooperative policies were able to outperform both uncooperative policies as well as a single agent trained across the entire domain. CSAC achieved a success rate of at least 20\% higher than the uncooperative policies, and converged on a solution at least 4 times faster than the single agent.",0

"Autonomous driving has achieved significant progress in recent years, but autonomous cars are still unable to tackle high-risk situations where a potential accident is likely. In such near-accident scenarios, even a minor change in the vehicle's actions may result in drastically different consequences. To avoid unsafe actions in near-accident scenarios, we need to fully explore the environment. However, reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), two widely-used policy learning methods, cannot model rapid phase transitions and are not scalable to fully cover all the states. To address driving in near-accident scenarios, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement and imitation learning (H-ReIL) approach that consists of low-level policies learned by IL for discrete driving modes, and a high-level policy learned by RL that switches between different driving modes. Our approach exploits the advantages of both IL and RL by integrating them into a unified learning framework. Experimental results and user studies suggest our approach can achieve higher efficiency and safety compared to other methods. Analyses of the policies demonstrate our high-level policy appropriately switches between different low-level policies in near-accident driving situations.",0

"We consider reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic MDPs with adversarial full-information reward feedback and unknown fixed transition kernels. We propose two model-free policy optimization algorithms, POWER and POWER++, and establish guarantees for their dynamic regret. Compared with the classical notion of static regret, dynamic regret is a stronger notion as it explicitly accounts for the non-stationarity of environments. The dynamic regret attained by the proposed algorithms interpolates between different regimes of non-stationarity, and moreover satisfies a notion of adaptive (near-)optimality, in the sense that it matches the (near-)optimal static regret under slow-changing environments. The dynamic regret bound features two components, one arising from exploration, which deals with the uncertainty of transition kernels, and the other arising from adaptation, which deals with non-stationary environments. Specifically, we show that POWER++ improves over POWER on the second component of the dynamic regret by actively adapting to non-stationarity through prediction. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first dynamic regret analysis of model-free RL algorithms in non-stationary environments.",0

"Reinforcement learning allows solving complex tasks, however, the learning tends to be task-specific and the sample efficiency remains a challenge. We present Plan2Explore, a self-supervised reinforcement learning agent that tackles both these challenges through a new approach to self-supervised exploration and fast adaptation to new tasks, which need not be known during exploration. During exploration, unlike prior methods which retrospectively compute the novelty of observations after the agent has already reached them, our agent acts efficiently by leveraging planning to seek out expected future novelty. After exploration, the agent quickly adapts to multiple downstream tasks in a zero or a few-shot manner. We evaluate on challenging control tasks from high-dimensional image inputs. Without any training supervision or task-specific interaction, Plan2Explore outperforms prior self-supervised exploration methods, and in fact, almost matches the performances oracle which has access to rewards.

"This paper presents a recursive reasoning formalism of Bayesian optimization (BO) to model the reasoning process in the interactions between boundedly rational, self-interested agents with unknown, complex, and costly-to-evaluate payoff functions in repeated games, which we call Recursive Reasoning-Based BO (R2-B2).

"Learning robotic manipulation through reinforcement learning (RL) using only sparse reward signals is still considered a largely unsolved problem. Leveraging human demonstrations can make the learning process more sample efficient, but obtaining high-quality demonstrations can be costly or unfeasible. In this paper we propose a novel approach that introduces object-level demonstrations, i.e. examples of where the objects should be at any state. These demonstrations are generated automatically through RL hence require no expert knowledge. We observe that, during a manipulation task, an object is moved from an initial to a final position. When seen from the point of view of the object being manipulated, this induces a locomotion task that can be decoupled from the manipulation task and learnt through a physically-realistic simulator. The resulting object-level trajectories, called simulated locomotion demonstrations (SLDs), are then leveraged to define auxiliary rewards that are used to learn the manipulation policy. The proposed approach has been evaluated on 13 tasks of increasing complexity, and has been demonstrated to achieve higher success rate and faster learning rates compared to alternative algorithms. SLDs are especially beneficial for tasks like multi-object stacking and non-rigid object manipulation.",0

"In E-commerce, advertising is essential for merchants to reach their target users. The typical objective is to maximize the advertiser's cumulative revenue over a period of time under a budget constraint. In real applications, an advertisement (ad) usually needs to be exposed to the same user multiple times until the user finally contributes revenue (e.g., places an order). However, existing advertising systems mainly focus on the immediate revenue with single ad exposures, ignoring the contribution of each exposure to the final conversion, thus usually falls into suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we formulate the sequential advertising strategy optimization as a dynamic knapsack problem. We propose a theoretically guaranteed bilevel optimization framework, which significantly reduces the solution space of the original optimization space while ensuring the solution quality. To improve the exploration efficiency of reinforcement learning, we also devise an effective action space reduction approach. Extensive offline and online experiments show the superior performance of our approaches over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative revenue.",0
"Advertising is a crucial aspect of E-commerce that enables merchants to connect with their target audience.

"In preference-based reinforcement learning (RL), an agent interacts with the environment while receiving preferences instead of absolute feedback. While there is increasing research activity in preference-based RL, the design of formal frameworks that admit tractable theoretical analysis remains an open challenge. Building upon ideas from preference-based bandit learning and posterior sampling in RL, we present DUELING POSTERIOR SAMPLING (DPS), which employs preference-based posterior sampling to learn both the system dynamics and the underlying utility function that governs the preference feedback. As preference feedback is provided on trajectories rather than individual state-action pairs, we develop a Bayesian approach for the credit assignment problem, translating preferences to a posterior distribution over state-action reward models. We prove an asymptotic Bayesian no-regret rate for DPS with a Bayesian linear regression credit assignment model. This is the first regret guarantee for preference-based RL to our knowledge. We also discuss possible avenues for extending the proof methodology to other credit assignment models.

"Recently, many reinforcement learning techniques were shown to have provable guarantees in the simple case of linear dynamics, especially in problems like linear quadratic regulators. However, in practice, many reinforcement learning problems try to learn a policy directly from rich, high dimensional representations such as images. Even if there is an underlying dynamics that is linear in the correct latent representations (such as position and velocity), the rich representation is likely to be nonlinear and can contain irrelevant features. In this work we study a model where there is a hidden linear subspace in which the dynamics is linear. For such a model we give an efficient algorithm for extracting the linear subspace with linear dynamics. We then extend our idea to extracting a nonlinear mapping, and empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach in simple settings with rich observations.",0

"Designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization appears ubiquitously in various scientific fields. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have gained considerable attention as a new approach: they can automate the design of a solver while relying less on sophisticated domain knowledge of the target problem. However, the existing DRL solvers determine the solution using a number of stages proportional to the number of elements in the solution, which severely limits their applicability to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we seek to resolve this issue by proposing a novel DRL scheme, coined learning what to defer (LwD), where the agent adaptively shrinks or stretch the number of stages by learning to distribute the element-wise decisions of the solution at each stage. We apply the proposed framework to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, and demonstrate its significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art DRL scheme. We also show that LwD can outperform the conventional MIS solvers on large-scale graphs having millions of vertices, under a limited time budget.",0

"There has been a current trend in reinforcement learning for healthcare literature, where in order to prepare clinical datasets, researchers will carry forward the last results of the non-administered test known as the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) value to fill in gaps, assuming that it is still an accurate indicator of the patient's current state. These values are carried forward without maintaining information about exactly how these values were imputed, leading to ambiguity. Our approach models this problem using OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car and aims to address when to observe the patient's physiological state and partly how to intervene, as we have assumed we can only act after following an observation. So far, we have found that for a last-observation-carried-forward implementation of the state space, augmenting the state with counters for each state variable tracking the time since last observation was made, improves the predictive performance of an agent, supporting the notion of ""informative missingness"", and using a neural network based Dynamics Model to predict the most probable next state value of non-observed state variables instead of carrying forward the last observed value through LOCF further improves the agent's performance, leading to faster convergence and reduced variance.",0

This assumes that the LOCF value is an accurate indicator of the patient's current state and does not maintain information about how the values were imputed, resulting in ambiguity. Our approach utilizes OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car to address the problem of when to observe the patient's physiological state and how to intervene. We can only act after observing the patient's state. We found that augmenting the state with counters for each state variable tracking the time since the last observation and using a neural network-based Dynamics Model to predict the most probable next state value of non-observed state variables improves the agent's performance. This leads to faster convergence and reduced variance, supporting the concept of ""informative missingness.""",1
"Model usage is the central challenge of model-based reinforcement learning. Although dynamics model based on deep neural networks provide good generalization for single step prediction, such ability is over exploited when it is used to predict long horizon trajectories due to compounding errors. In this work, we propose a Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, which we called Maximum Entropy Model Rollouts (MEMR). To eliminate the compounding errors, we only use our model to generate single-step rollouts. Furthermore, we propose to generate \emph{diverse} model rollouts by non-uniform sampling of the environment states such that the entropy of the model rollouts is maximized. We mathematically derived the maximum entropy sampling criteria for one data case under Gaussian prior. To accomplish this criteria, we propose to utilize a prioritized experience replay. Our preliminary experiments in challenging locomotion benchmarks show that our approach achieves the same sample efficiency of the best model-based algorithms, matches the asymptotic performance of the best model-free algorithms, and significantly reduces the computation requirements of other model-based methods.",0

"We study the exploration problem with approximate linear action-value functions in episodic reinforcement learning under the notion of low inherent Bellman error, a condition normally employed to show convergence of approximate value iteration. First we relate this condition to other common frameworks and show that it is strictly more general than the low rank (or linear) MDP assumption of prior work. Second we provide an algorithm with a high probability regret bound $\widetilde O(\sum_{t=1}^H d_t \sqrt{K} + \sum_{t=1}^H \sqrt{d_t} \IBE K)$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, $\IBE$ is the value if the inherent Bellman error and $d_t$ is the feature dimension at timestep $t$. In addition, we show that the result is unimprovable beyond constants and logs by showing a matching lower bound. This has two important consequences: 1) it shows that exploration is possible using only \emph{batch assumptions} with an algorithm that achieves the optimal statistical rate for the setting we consider, which is more general than prior work on low-rank MDPs 2) the lack of closedness (measured by the inherent Bellman error) is only amplified by $\sqrt{d_t}$ despite working in the online setting. Finally, the algorithm reduces to the celebrated \textsc{LinUCB} when $H=1$ but with a different choice of the exploration parameter that allows handling misspecified contextual linear bandits. While computational tractability questions remain open for the MDP setting, this enriches the class of MDPs with a linear representation for the action-value function where statistically efficient reinforcement learning is possible.",0
"In this study, we investigate the exploration problem in episodic reinforcement learning using approximate linear action-value functions. Our focus is on the condition of low inherent Bellman error, which is commonly used to demonstrate convergence of approximate value iteration. We demonstrate that this condition is more general than the low rank MDP assumption used in prior work. We present an algorithm that achieves a high probability regret bound, which is a function of the horizon, the number of episodes, the feature dimension at each timestep, and the inherent Bellman error. We also show that this result cannot be improved beyond certain constants and logarithms, as demonstrated by a matching lower bound. Our findings have two important implications: 1) exploration is feasible using only batch assumptions, and our algorithm achieves the optimal statistical rate for the more general setting we consider, which surpasses prior work on low-rank MDPs, and 2) even in the online setting, the lack of closedness, as measured by the inherent Bellman error, is only amplified by the square root of the feature dimension at each timestep. Finally, our algorithm is equivalent to the LinUCB algorithm when the horizon is one, but with a different exploration parameter that enables the handling of misspecified contextual linear bandits. While computational tractability remains a challenge for the MDP setting, our study expands the class of MDPs with a linear representation for the action-value function, making efficient reinforcement learning statistically possible.",1
"Bayesian deep neural networks (DNNs) can provide a mathematically grounded framework to quantify uncertainty in predictions from image captioning models. We propose a Bayesian variant of policy-gradient based reinforcement learning training technique for image captioning models to directly optimize non-differentiable image captioning quality metrics such as CIDEr-D. We extend the well-known Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) approach for image captioning models by incorporating Bayesian inference, and refer to it as B-SCST. The ""baseline"" for the policy-gradients in B-SCST is generated by averaging predictive quality metrics (CIDEr-D) of the captions drawn from the distribution obtained using a Bayesian DNN model. We infer this predictive distribution using Monte Carlo (MC) dropout approximate variational inference. We show that B-SCST improves CIDEr-D scores on Flickr30k, MS COCO and VizWiz image captioning datasets, compared to the SCST approach. We also provide a study of uncertainty quantification for the predicted captions, and demonstrate that it correlates well with the CIDEr-D scores.

"The existing action recognition methods are mainly based on clip-level classifiers such as two-stream CNNs or 3D CNNs, which are trained from the randomly selected clips and applied to densely sampled clips during testing. However, this standard setting might be suboptimal for training classifiers and also requires huge computational overhead when deployed in practice. To address these issues, we propose a new framework for action recognition in videos, called {\em Dynamic Sampling Networks} (DSN), by designing a dynamic sampling module to improve the discriminative power of learned clip-level classifiers and as well increase the inference efficiency during testing. Specifically, DSN is composed of a sampling module and a classification module, whose objective is to learn a sampling policy to on-the-fly select which clips to keep and train a clip-level classifier to perform action recognition based on these selected clips, respectively. In particular, given an input video, we train an observation network in an associative reinforcement learning setting to maximize the rewards of the selected clips with a correct prediction. We perform extensive experiments to study different aspects of the DSN framework on four action recognition datasets: UCF101, HMDB51, THUMOS14, and ActivityNet v1.3. The experimental results demonstrate that DSN is able to greatly improve the inference efficiency by only using less than half of the clips, which can still obtain a slightly better or comparable recognition accuracy to the state-of-the-art approaches.",0

"We address the problem of Bayesian reinforcement learning using efficient model-based online planning. We propose an optimism-free Bayes-adaptive algorithm to induce deeper and sparser exploration with a theoretical bound on its performance relative to the Bayes optimal policy, with a lower computational complexity. The main novelty is the use of a candidate policy generator, to generate long-term options in the planning tree (over beliefs), which allows us to create much sparser and deeper trees.

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently achieved remarkable successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in methods for training large deep networks. However, these methods usually require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet) that uses neural nets to produce good representations to be used as inputs to deep RL algorithms. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually supposed to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger feature propagation together with larger networks (and thus larger search space) allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and performance.

"This paper prescribes a suite of techniques for off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) that simplify the training process and reduce the sample complexity. First, we show that simple Deterministic Policy Gradient works remarkably well as long as the overestimation bias is controlled. This is contrast to existing literature which creates sophisticated off-policy techniques. Second, we pinpoint training instabilities, typical of off-policy algorithms, to the greedy policy update step; existing solutions such as delayed policy updates do not mitigate this issue. Third, we show that ideas in the propensity estimation literature can be used to importance-sample transitions from the replay buffer and selectively update the policy to prevent deterioration of performance.

"In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many challenging strategy games. Because these games have complicated rules, an action sampled from the full discrete action space will typically be invalid. The usual approach to deal with this problem in policy gradient algorithms is to ""mask out"" invalid actions and just sample from the set of valid actions. The implications of this process, however, remain under-investigated. In this paper, we show that the standard working mechanism of invalid action masking corresponds to valid policy gradient updates. More interestingly, it works by applying a state-dependent differentiable function during the calculation of action probability distribution. Additionally, we show its critical importance to the performance of policy gradient algorithms. Specifically, our experiments show that invalid action masking scales well when the space of invalid actions is large, while the common approach of giving negative rewards for invalid actions will fail. Finally, we provide further insights by evaluating different action masking regimes, such as removing masking after an agent has been trained using masking.",0
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved impressive results in complex strategy games, thanks to their ability to handle intricate rules. However, selecting a valid action from the full discrete action space is challenging, as most actions will be invalid. Policy gradient algorithms typically address this issue by masking out invalid actions and sampling from the set of valid ones. Nevertheless, the implications of this process are not fully understood. This study demonstrates that invalid action masking is a valid policy gradient update mechanism that involves a differentiable function dependent on the state. The research also highlights the critical role played by invalid action masking in policy gradient algorithm performance, especially when dealing with a vast space of invalid actions. Conversely, the common practice of giving negative rewards for invalid actions fails under the same conditions. The study concludes by examining different action masking regimes, including removing masking after an agent has undergone training with masking.",1
"Reinforcement learning using a novel predictive representation is applied to autonomous driving to accomplish the task of driving between lane markings where substantial benefits in performance and generalization are observed on unseen test roads in both simulation and on a real Jackal robot. The novel predictive representation is learned by general value functions (GVFs) to provide out-of-policy, or counter-factual, predictions of future lane centeredness and road angle that form a compact representation of the state of the agent improving learning in both online and offline reinforcement learning to learn to drive an autonomous vehicle with methods that generalizes well to roads not in the training data. Experiments in both simulation and the real-world demonstrate that predictive representations in reinforcement learning improve learning efficiency, smoothness of control and generalization to roads that the agent was never shown during training, including damaged lane markings. It was found that learning a predictive representation that consists of several predictions over different time scales, or discount factors, improves the performance and smoothness of the control substantially. The Jackal robot was trained in a two step process where the predictive representation is learned first followed by a batch reinforcement learning algorithm (BCQ) from data collected through both automated and human-guided exploration in the environment.

"Graph data are pervasive in many real-world applications. Recently, increasing attention has been paid on graph neural networks (GNNs), which aim to model the local graph structures and capture the hierarchical patterns by aggregating the information from neighbors with stackable network modules. Motivated by the observation that different nodes often require different iterations of aggregation to fully capture the structural information, in this paper, we propose to explicitly sample diverse iterations of aggregation for different nodes to boost the performance of GNNs. It is a challenging task to develop an effective aggregation strategy for each node, given complex graphs and sparse features. Moreover, it is not straightforward to derive an efficient algorithm since we need to feed the sampled nodes into different number of network layers. To address the above challenges, we propose Policy-GNN, a meta-policy framework that models the sampling procedure and message passing of GNNs into a combined learning process. Specifically, Policy-GNN uses a meta-policy to adaptively determine the number of aggregations for each node. The meta-policy is trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL) by exploiting the feedback from the model. We further introduce parameter sharing and a buffer mechanism to boost the training efficiency. Experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets suggest that Policy-GNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, showing the promise in aggregation optimization for GNNs.",0

"Reinforcement learning algorithms usually assume that all actions are always available to an agent. However, both people and animals understand the general link between the features of their environment and the actions that are feasible. Gibson (1977) coined the term ""affordances"" to describe the fact that certain states enable an agent to do certain actions, in the context of embodied agents. In this paper, we develop a theory of affordances for agents who learn and plan in Markov Decision Processes. Affordances play a dual role in this case. On one hand, they allow faster planning, by reducing the number of actions available in any given situation. On the other hand, they facilitate more efficient and precise learning of transition models from data, especially when such models require function approximation. We establish these properties through theoretical results as well as illustrative examples. We also propose an approach to learn affordances and use it to estimate transition models that are simpler and generalize better.",0

"Data simulation engines like Unity are becoming an increasingly important data source that allows us to acquire ground truth labels conveniently. Moreover, we can flexibly edit the content of an image in the engine, such as objects (position, orientation) and environments (illumination, occlusion). When using simulated data as training sets, its editable content can be leveraged to mimic the distribution of real-world data, and thus reduce the content difference between the synthetic and real domains. This paper explores content adaptation in the context of semantic segmentation, where the complex street scenes are fully synthesized using 19 classes of virtual objects from a first person driver perspective and controlled by 23 attributes. To optimize the attribute values and obtain a training set of similar content to real-world data, we propose a scalable discretization-and-relaxation (SDR) approach. Under a reinforcement learning framework, we formulate attribute optimization as a random-to-optimized mapping problem using a neural network. Our method has three characteristics. 1) Instead of editing attributes of individual objects, we focus on global attributes that have large influence on the scene structure, such as object density and illumination. 2) Attributes are quantized to discrete values, so as to reduce search space and training complexity. 3) Correlated attributes are jointly optimized in a group, so as to avoid meaningless scene structures and find better convergence points.

"Being able to predict human gaze behavior has obvious importance for behavioral vision and for computer vision applications. Most models have mainly focused on predicting free-viewing behavior using saliency maps, but these predictions do not generalize to goal-directed behavior, such as when a person searches for a visual target object. We propose the first inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) model to learn the internal reward function and policy used by humans during visual search. The viewer's internal belief states were modeled as dynamic contextual belief maps of object locations. These maps were learned by IRL and then used to predict behavioral scanpaths for multiple target categories. To train and evaluate our IRL model we created COCO-Search18, which is now the largest dataset of high-quality search fixations in existence. COCO-Search18 has 10 participants searching for each of 18 target-object categories in 6202 images, making about 300,000 goal-directed fixations. When trained and evaluated on COCO-Search18, the IRL model outperformed baseline models in predicting search fixation scanpaths, both in terms of similarity to human search behavior and search efficiency. Finally, reward maps recovered by the IRL model reveal distinctive target-dependent patterns of object prioritization, which we interpret as a learned object context.",0

Such global convergence has been shown only for the linear (or linear-type) MDP and linear (or linearizable) reward. In this paper, we study GAIL under general MDP and for nonlinear reward function classes (as long as the objective function is strongly concave with respect to the reward parameter). We characterize the global convergence with a sublinear rate for a broad range of commonly used policy gradient algorithms, all of which are implemented in an alternating manner with stochastic gradient ascent for reward update, including projected policy gradient (PPG)-GAIL, Frank-Wolfe policy gradient (FWPG)-GAIL, trust region policy optimization (TRPO)-GAIL and natural policy gradient (NPG)-GAIL.

"We consider un-discounted reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov decision processes (MDPs) under drifting non-stationarity, i.e., both the reward and state transition distributions are allowed to evolve over time, as long as their respective total variations, quantified by suitable metrics, do not exceed certain variation budgets. We first develop the Sliding Window Upper-Confidence bound for Reinforcement Learning with Confidence Widening (SWUCRL2-CW) algorithm, and establish its dynamic regret bound when the variation budgets are known. In addition, we propose the Bandit-over-Reinforcement Learning (BORL) algorithm to adaptively tune the SWUCRL2-CW algorithm to achieve the same dynamic regret bound, but in a parameter-free manner, i.e., without knowing the variation budgets. Notably, learning non-stationary MDPs via the conventional optimistic exploration technique presents a unique challenge absent in existing (non-stationary) bandit learning settings. We overcome the challenge by a novel confidence widening technique that incorporates additional optimism.",0

"Motivated by broad applications in reinforcement learning and federated learning, we study local stochastic approximation over a network of agents, where their goal is to find the root of an operator composed of the local operators at the agents. Our focus is to characterize the finite-time performance of this method when the data at each agent are generated from Markov processes, and hence they are dependent. In particular, we provide the convergence rates of local stochastic approximation for both constant and time-varying step sizes. Our results show that these rates are within a logarithmic factor of the ones under independent data. We then illustrate the applications of these results to different interesting problems in multi-task reinforcement learning and federated learning.",0

"We study the problem of system identification and adaptive control in partially observable linear dynamical systems. Adaptive and closed-loop system identification is a challenging problem due to correlations introduced in data collection. In this paper, we present the first model estimation method with finite-time guarantees in both open and closed-loop system identification. Deploying this estimation method, we propose adaptive control online learning (AdaptOn), an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively learns the system dynamics and continuously updates its controller through online learning steps. AdaptOn estimates the model dynamics by occasionally solving a linear regression problem through interactions with the environment. Using policy re-parameterization and the estimated model, AdaptOn constructs counterfactual loss functions to be used for updating the controller through online gradient descent. Over time, AdaptOn improves its model estimates and obtains more accurate gradient updates to improve the controller. We show that AdaptOn achieves a regret upper bound of $\text{polylog}\left(T\right)$, after $T$ time steps of agent-environment interaction.

"Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms allow us to combine model-generated data with those collected from interaction with the real system in order to alleviate the data efficiency problem in RL. However, designing such algorithms is often challenging because the bias in simulated data may overshadow the ease of data generation. A potential solution to this challenge is to jointly learn and improve model and policy using a universal objective function. In this paper, we leverage the connection between RL and probabilistic inference, and formulate such an objective function as a variational lower-bound of a log-likelihood. This allows us to use expectation maximization (EM) and iteratively fix a baseline policy and learn a variational distribution, consisting of a model and a policy (E-step), followed by improving the baseline policy given the learned variational distribution (M-step). We propose model-based and model-free policy iteration (actor-critic) style algorithms for the E-step and show how the variational distribution learned by them can be used to optimize the M-step in a fully model-based fashion. Our experiments on a number of continuous control tasks show that despite being more complex, our model-based (E-step) algorithm, called {\em variational model-based policy optimization} (VMBPO), is more sample-efficient and robust to hyper-parameter tuning than its model-free (E-step) counterpart. Using the same control tasks, we also compare VMBPO with several state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms and show its sample efficiency and performance.",0

"A major challenge in modern reinforcement learning (RL) is efficient control of dynamical systems from high-dimensional sensory observations. Learning controllable embedding (LCE) is a promising approach that addresses this challenge by embedding the observations into a lower-dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics, and utilizing it to perform control in the latent space. Two important questions in this area are how to learn a representation that is amenable to the control problem at hand, and how to achieve an end-to-end framework for representation learning and control. In this paper, we take a few steps towards addressing these questions. We first formulate a LCE model to learn representations that are suitable to be used by a policy iteration style algorithm in the latent space. We call this model control-aware representation learning (CARL). We derive a loss function for CARL that has close connection to the prediction, consistency, and curvature (PCC) principle for representation learning. We derive three implementations of CARL. In the offline implementation, we replace the locally-linear control algorithm (e.g.,~iLQR) used by the existing LCE methods with a RL algorithm, namely model-based soft actor-critic, and show that it results in significant improvement. In online CARL, we interleave representation learning and control, and demonstrate further gain in performance. Finally, we propose value-guided CARL, a variation in which we optimize a weighted version of the CARL loss function, where the weights depend on the TD-error of the current policy. We evaluate the proposed algorithms by extensive experiments on benchmark tasks and compare them with several LCE baselines.",0

"We develop provably efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for two-player zero-sum finite-horizon Markov games with simultaneous moves. To incorporate function approximation, we consider a family of Markov games where the reward function and transition kernel possess a linear structure. Both the offline and online settings of the problems are considered. In the offline setting, we control both players and aim to find the Nash Equilibrium by minimizing the duality gap. In the online setting, we control a single player playing against an arbitrary opponent and aim to minimize the regret. For both settings, we propose an optimistic variant of the least-squares minimax value iteration algorithm.

"Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) formulates meta-learning as a bilevel optimization problem, where the inner level solves each subtask based on a shared prior, while the outer level searches for the optimal shared prior by optimizing its aggregated performance over all the subtasks. Despite its empirical success, MAML remains less understood in theory, especially in terms of its global optimality, due to the nonconvexity of the meta-objective (the outer-level objective). To bridge such a gap between theory and practice, we characterize the optimality gap of the stationary points attained by MAML for both reinforcement learning and supervised learning, where the inner-level and outer-level problems are solved via first-order optimization methods. In particular, our characterization connects the optimality gap of such stationary points with (i) the functional geometry of inner-level objectives and (ii) the representation power of function approximators, including linear models and neural networks.

"One of the central challenges faced by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent is to effectively learn a (near-)optimal policy in environments with large state spaces having sparse and noisy feedback signals. In real-world applications, an expert with additional domain knowledge can help in speeding up the learning process via \emph{shaping the environment}, i.e., making the environment more learner-friendly. A popular paradigm in literature is \emph{potential-based reward shaping}, where the environment's reward function is augmented with additional local rewards using a potential function. However, the applicability of potential-based reward shaping is limited in settings where (i) the state space is very large, and it is challenging to compute an appropriate potential function, (ii) the feedback signals are noisy, and even with shaped rewards the agent could be trapped in local optima, and (iii) changing the rewards alone is not sufficient, and effective shaping requires changing the dynamics. We address these limitations of potential-based shaping methods and propose a novel framework of \emph{environment shaping using state abstraction}. Our key idea is to compress the environment's large state space with noisy signals to an abstracted space, and to use this abstraction in creating smoother and more effective feedback signals for the agent. We study the theoretical underpinnings of our abstraction-based environment shaping, and show that the agent's policy learnt in the shaped environment preserves near-optimal behavior in the original environment.",0
"Learning an (almost) perfect policy in environments with vast state spaces and scarce and inaccurate feedback signals is a major challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. In practical scenarios, experts possessing domain knowledge can accelerate the learning process by making the environment more learner-friendly, a process known as ""shaping the environment"". One such popular technique is ""potential-based reward shaping"", where the environment's reward function is supplemented with local rewards using a potential function. However, potential-based reward shaping is not always practical when the state space is vast, the feedback signals are noisy, and changing the rewards alone is insufficient. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ""environment shaping using state abstraction"" framework that compresses the environment's large state space with noisy signals to a more concise space and creates better feedback signals for the agent. We explore the theoretical basis of our abstraction-based environment shaping approach and demonstrate that the agent's policy learned in the shaped environment preserves near-optimal behavior in the original environment.",1

Unlike existing approaches with regret guarantees, it does not use any kind of partitioning of the state-action space. For problems with $K$ episodes and horizon $H$, we provide a regret bound of $O\left( H^3 K^{\max\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2d}{2d+1}\right)}\right)$, where $d$ is the covering dimension of the joint state-action space.

"In reinforcement learning, the discount factor $\gamma$ controls the agent's effective planning horizon. Traditionally, this parameter was considered part of the MDP; however, as deep reinforcement learning algorithms tend to become unstable when the effective planning horizon is long, recent works refer to $\gamma$ as a hyper-parameter -- thus changing the underlying MDP and potentially leading the agent towards sub-optimal behavior on the original task. In this work, we introduce \emph{reward tweaking}. Reward tweaking learns a surrogate reward function $\tilde r$ for the discounted setting that induces optimal behavior on the original finite-horizon total reward task. Theoretically, we show that there exists a surrogate reward that leads to optimality in the original task and discuss the robustness of our approach. Additionally, we perform experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks and show that reward tweaking guides the agent towards better long-horizon returns although it plans for short horizons.",0
"The discount factor $\gamma$ plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning by determining the agent's effective planning horizon. In traditional approaches, $\gamma$ was considered as part of the MDP.

"Animals are able to discover the topological map (graph) of surrounding environment, which will be used for navigation. Inspired by this biological phenomenon, researchers have recently proposed to generate graph representation for Markov decision process (MDP) and use such graphs for planning in reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing graph generation methods suffer from many drawbacks. One drawback is that existing methods do not learn an abstraction for graphs, which results in high memory and computation cost. This drawback also makes generated graph non-robust, which degrades the planning performance. Another drawback is that existing methods cannot be used for facilitating exploration which is important in RL. In this paper, we propose a new method, called topological map abstraction (TOMA), for graph generation. TOMA can generate an abstract graph representation for MDP, which costs much less memory and computation cost than existing methods. Furthermore, TOMA can be used for facilitating exploration. In particular, we propose planning to explore, in which TOMA is used to accelerate exploration by guiding the agent towards unexplored states. A novel experience replay module called vertex memory is also proposed to improve exploration performance.

"In reward-poisoning attacks against reinforcement learning (RL), an attacker can perturb the environment reward $r_t$ into $r_t+\delta_t$ at each step, with the goal of forcing the RL agent to learn a nefarious policy. We categorize such attacks by the infinity-norm constraint on $\delta_t$: We provide a lower threshold below which reward-poisoning attack is infeasible and RL is certified to be safe; we provide a corresponding upper threshold above which the attack is feasible. Feasible attacks can be further categorized as non-adaptive where $\delta_t$ depends only on $(s_t,a_t, s_{t+1})$, or adaptive where $\delta_t$ depends further on the RL agent's learning process at time $t$. Non-adaptive attacks have been the focus of prior works. However, we show that under mild conditions, adaptive attacks can achieve the nefarious policy in steps polynomial in state-space size $|S|$, whereas non-adaptive attacks require exponential steps. We provide a constructive proof that a Fast Adaptive Attack strategy achieves the polynomial rate. Finally, we show that empirically an attacker can find effective reward-poisoning attacks using state-of-the-art deep RL techniques.",0

"We study risk-sensitive reinforcement learning in episodic Markov decision processes with unknown transition kernels, where the goal is to optimize the total reward under the risk measure of exponential utility. We propose two provably efficient model-free algorithms, Risk-Sensitive Value Iteration (RSVI) and Risk-Sensitive Q-learning (RSQ). These algorithms implement a form of risk-sensitive optimism in the face of uncertainty, which adapts to both risk-seeking and risk-averse modes of exploration. We prove that RSVI attains an $\tilde{O}\big(\lambda(|\beta| H^2) \cdot \sqrt{H^{3} S^{2}AT} \big)$ regret, while RSQ attains an $\tilde{O}\big(\lambda(|\beta| H^2) \cdot \sqrt{H^{4} SAT} \big)$ regret, where $\lambda(u) = (e^{3u}-1)/u$ for $u>0$. In the above, $\beta$ is the risk parameter of the exponential utility function, $S$ the number of states, $A$ the number of actions, $T$ the total number of timesteps, and $H$ the episode length. On the flip side, we establish a regret lower bound showing that the exponential dependence on $|\beta|$ and $H$ is unavoidable for any algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret (even when the risk objective is on the same scale as the original reward), thus certifying the near-optimality of the proposed algorithms. Our results demonstrate that incorporating risk awareness into reinforcement learning necessitates an exponential cost in $|\beta|$ and $H$, which quantifies the fundamental tradeoff between risk sensitivity (related to aleatoric uncertainty) and sample efficiency (related to epistemic uncertainty). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first regret analysis of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with the exponential utility.",0

Through our analysis, we have proven that RSVI has an $\tilde{O}\big(\lambda(|\beta| H^2) \cdot \sqrt{H^{3} S^{2}AT} \big)$ regret, while RSQ has an $\tilde{O}\big(\lambda(|\beta| H^2) \cdot \sqrt{H^{4} SAT} \big)$ regret, where $\lambda(u) = (e^{3u}-1)/u$ for $u>0$. Here, $\beta$ represents the risk parameter of the exponential utility function, $S$ represents the number of states, $A$ represents the number of actions, $T$ represents the total number of timesteps, and $H$ represents the episode length. Additionally, we have established a lower bound on regret that shows that any algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret will have an exponential dependence on $|\beta|$ and $H$. Our study highlights the tradeoff between risk sensitivity and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning and provides the first regret analysis of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with the exponential utility.",1
"Most reinforcement learning approaches used in behavior generation utilize vectorial information as input. However, this requires the network to have a pre-defined input-size -- in semantic environments this means assuming the maximum number of vehicles. Additionally, this vectorial representation is not invariant to the order and number of vehicles. To mitigate the above-stated disadvantages, we propose combining graph neural networks with actor-critic reinforcement learning. As graph neural networks apply the same network to every vehicle and aggregate incoming edge information, they are invariant to the number and order of vehicles. This makes them ideal candidates to be used as networks in semantic environments -- environments consisting of objects lists. Graph neural networks exhibit some other advantages that make them favorable to be used in semantic environments. The relational information is explicitly given and does not have to be inferred. Moreover, graph neural networks propagate information through the network and can gather higher-degree information. We demonstrate our approach using a highway lane-change scenario and compare the performance of graph neural networks to conventional ones. We show that graph neural networks are capable of handling scenarios with a varying number and order of vehicles during training and application.",0
"The majority of reinforcement learning methods used for behavior generation rely on vectorial information as input. Nonetheless, this necessitates a predetermined input size for the network, which assumes the highest number of vehicles in semantic environments. Furthermore, the vectorial representation is not insensitive to the sequence and quantity of vehicles. To address these drawbacks, we suggest merging graph neural networks with actor-critic reinforcement learning. Graph neural networks are capable of deploying the same network to every vehicle and collecting incoming edge information, making them insensitive to the number and order of vehicles. Hence, they are suitable for networks used in semantic environments, where objects lists are present. Graph neural networks present other advantages, such as explicitly given relational information and the ability to gather higher-degree information. We have demonstrated our approach using a highway lane-change scenario and compared the performance of graph neural networks to conventional ones.

"Much of the current work on reinforcement learning studies episodic settings, where the agent is reset between trials to an initial state distribution, often with well-shaped reward functions. Non-episodic settings, where the agent must learn through continuous interaction with the world without resets, and where the agent receives only delayed and sparse reward signals, is substantially more difficult, but arguably more realistic considering real-world environments do not present the learner with a convenient ""reset mechanism"" and easy reward shaping. In this paper, instead of studying algorithmic improvements that can address such non-episodic and sparse reward settings, we instead study the kinds of environment properties that can make learning under such conditions easier. Understanding how properties of the environment impact the performance of reinforcement learning agents can help us to structure our tasks in ways that make learning tractable. We first discuss what we term ""environment shaping"" -- modifications to the environment that provide an alternative to reward shaping, and may be easier to implement. We then discuss an even simpler property that we refer to as ""dynamism,"" which describes the degree to which the environment changes independent of the agent's actions and can be measured by environment transition entropy. Surprisingly, we find that even this property can substantially alleviate the challenges associated with non-episodic RL in sparse reward settings. We provide an empirical evaluation on a set of new tasks focused on non-episodic learning with sparse rewards. Through this study, we hope to shift the focus of the community towards analyzing how properties of the environment can affect learning and the ultimate type of behavior that is learned via RL.",0
"The current research on reinforcement learning mainly focuses on episodic settings, where the agent is reset to an initial state distribution with well-shaped reward functions.

"Empowered by expressive function approximators such as neural networks, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) achieves tremendous empirical successes. However, learning expressive function approximators requires collecting a large dataset (interventional data) by interacting with the environment. Such a lack of sample efficiency prohibits the application of DRL to critical scenarios, e.g., autonomous driving and personalized medicine, since trial and error in the online setting is often unsafe and even unethical. In this paper, we study how to incorporate the dataset (observational data) collected offline, which is often abundantly available in practice, to improve the sample efficiency in the online setting. To incorporate the possibly confounded observational data, we propose the deconfounded optimistic value iteration (DOVI) algorithm, which incorporates the confounded observational data in a provably efficient manner. More specifically, DOVI explicitly adjusts for the confounding bias in the observational data, where the confounders are partially observed or unobserved. In both cases, such adjustments allow us to construct the bonus based on a notion of information gain, which takes into account the amount of information acquired from the offline setting. In particular, we prove that the regret of DOVI is smaller than the optimal regret achievable in the pure online setting by a multiplicative factor, which decreases towards zero when the confounded observational data are more informative upon the adjustments. Our algorithm and analysis serve as a step towards causal reinforcement learning.",0

"Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using a fixed offline dataset of logged interactions is an important consideration in real world applications. This paper studies offline RL using the DQN replay dataset comprising the entire replay experience of a DQN agent on 60 Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that recent off-policy deep RL algorithms, even when trained solely on this fixed dataset, outperform the fully trained DQN agent. To enhance generalization in the offline setting, we present Random Ensemble Mixture (REM), a robust Q-learning algorithm that enforces optimal Bellman consistency on random convex combinations of multiple Q-value estimates. Offline REM trained on the DQN replay dataset surpasses strong RL baselines. Ablation studies highlight the role of offline dataset size and diversity as well as the algorithm choice in our positive results.

"This paper presents a framework to tackle constrained combinatorial optimization problems using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). To this end, we extend the Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) theory in order to deal with constraints in its formulation.   Notably, we propose defining constrained combinatorial problems as fully observable Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDP). In that context, the solution is iteratively constructed based on interactions with the environment. The model, in addition to the reward signal, relies on penalty signals generated from constraint dissatisfaction to infer a policy that acts as a heuristic algorithm. Moreover, having access to the complete state representation during the optimization process allows us to rely on memory-less architectures, enhancing the results obtained in previous sequence-to-sequence approaches. Conducted experiments on the constrained Job Shop and Resource Allocation problems prove the superiority of the proposal for computing rapid solutions when compared to classical heuristic, metaheuristic, and Constraint Programming (CP) solvers.",0

"We consider the exploration-exploitation dilemma in finite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL). When the state space is large or continuous, traditional tabular approaches are unfeasible and some form of function approximation is mandatory. In this paper, we introduce an optimistically-initialized variant of the popular randomized least-squares value iteration (RLSVI), a model-free algorithm where exploration is induced by perturbing the least-squares approximation of the action-value function. Under the assumption that the Markov decision process has low-rank transition dynamics, we prove that the frequentist regret of RLSVI is upper-bounded by $\widetilde O(d^2 H^2 \sqrt{T})$ where $ d $ are the feature dimension, $ H $ is the horizon, and $ T $ is the total number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first frequentist regret analysis for randomized exploration with function approximation.",0

"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) achieves significant empirical successes. However, MARL suffers from the curse of many agents. In this paper, we exploit the symmetry of agents in MARL. In the most generic form, we study a mean-field MARL problem. Such a mean-field MARL is defined on mean-field states, which are distributions that are supported on continuous space. Based on the mean embedding of the distributions, we propose MF-FQI algorithm that solves the mean-field MARL and establishes a non-asymptotic analysis for MF-FQI algorithm. We highlight that MF-FQI algorithm enjoys a ""blessing of many agents"" property in the sense that a larger number of observed agents improves the performance of MF-FQI algorithm.",0

"The principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty is prevalent throughout sequential decision making problems such as multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning (RL), often coming with strong theoretical guarantees. However, it remains a challenge to scale these approaches to the deep RL paradigm, which has achieved a great deal of attention in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a tractable approach to optimism via noise augmented Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which we show can obtain a competitive regret bound: $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( |\mathcal{S}|H\sqrt{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}| T } )$ when augmenting using Gaussian noise, where $T$ is the total number of environment steps.

"Recently, several approaches have been proposed to solve language generation problems. Transformer is currently state-of-the-art seq-to-seq model in language generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is useful in solving exposure bias and the optimisation on non-differentiable metrics in seq-to-seq language learning. However, Transformer is hard to combine with RL as the costly computing resource is required for sampling. We tackle this problem by proposing an off-policy RL learning algorithm where a behaviour policy represented by GRUs performs the sampling. We reduce the high variance of importance sampling (IS) by applying the truncated relative importance sampling (TRIS) technique and Kullback-Leibler (KL)-control concept. TRIS is a simple yet effective technique, and there is a theoretical proof that KL-control helps to reduce the variance of IS. We formulate this off-policy RL based on self-critical sequence training. Specifically, we use a Transformer-based captioning model as the target policy and use an image-guided language auto-encoder as the behaviour policy to explore the environment. The proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the visual paragraph generation and improved results on image captioning.",0

"We study the effect of impairment on stochastic multi-armed bandits and develop new ways to mitigate it. Impairment effect is the phenomena where an agent only accrues reward for an action if they have played it at least a few times in the recent past. It is practically motivated by repetition and recency effects in domains such as advertising (here consumer behavior may require repeat actions by advertisers) and vocational training (here actions are complex skills that can only be mastered with repetition to get a payoff). Impairment can be naturally modelled as a temporal constraint on the strategy space, and we provide two novel algorithms that achieve sublinear regret, each working with different assumptions on the impairment effect. We introduce a new notion called bucketing in our algorithm design, and show how it can effectively address impairment as well as a broader class of temporal constraints. Our regret bounds explicitly capture the cost of impairment and show that it scales (sub-)linearly with the degree of impairment. Our work complements recent work on modeling delays and corruptions, and we provide experimental evidence supporting our claims.",0

"In this paper, we consider the problem of online learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with very large state spaces. Under the assumptions of realizable function approximation and low Bellman ranks, we develop an online learning algorithm that learns the optimal value function while at the same time achieving very low cumulative regret during the learning process. Our learning algorithm, Adaptive Value-function Elimination (AVE), is inspired by the policy elimination algorithm proposed in (Jiang et al., 2017), known as OLIVE. One of our key technical contributions in AVE is to formulate the elimination steps in OLIVE as contextual bandit problems. This technique enables us to apply the active elimination and expert weighting methods from (Dudik et al., 2011), instead of the random action exploration scheme used in the original OLIVE algorithm, for more efficient exploration and better control of the regret incurred in each policy elimination step. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first $\sqrt{n}$-regret result for reinforcement learning in stochastic MDPs with general value function approximation.",0

"Manipulation tasks such as preparing a meal or assembling furniture remain highly challenging for robotics and vision. Traditional task and motion planning (TAMP) methods can solve complex tasks but require full state observability and are not adapted to dynamic scene changes.

Second, we demonstrate the versatility of our vision-based task planning in challenging settings with temporary occlusions and dynamic scene changes. Third, we propose an efficient training of basic skills from few synthetic demonstrations by exploring recent CNN architectures and data augmentation.

"Reward-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework which is suitable for both the batch RL setting and the setting where there are many reward functions of interest. During the exploration phase, an agent collects samples without using a pre-specified reward function. After the exploration phase, a reward function is given, and the agent uses samples collected during the exploration phase to compute a near-optimal policy. Jin et al. [2020] showed that in the tabular setting, the agent only needs to collect polynomial number of samples (in terms of the number states, the number of actions, and the planning horizon) for reward-free RL. However, in practice, the number of states and actions can be large, and thus function approximation schemes are required for generalization. In this work, we give both positive and negative results for reward-free RL with linear function approximation. We give an algorithm for reward-free RL in the linear Markov decision process setting where both the transition and the reward admit linear representations. The sample complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in the feature dimension and the planning horizon, and is completely independent of the number of states and actions. We further give an exponential lower bound for reward-free RL in the setting where only the optimal $Q$-function admits a linear representation.

"Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are among the most successful policy gradient approaches in deep reinforcement learning (RL). While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of challenging tasks, there is room for improvement in the stabilization of the policy learning and how the off-policy data are used. In this paper we revisit the theoretical foundations of these algorithms and propose a new algorithm which stabilizes the policy improvement through a proximity term that constrains the discounted state-action visitation distribution induced by consecutive policies to be close to one another. This proximity term, expressed in terms of the divergence between the visitation distributions, is learned in an off-policy and adversarial manner.

"Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) is an optimization method originally designed for tackling machine learning problems with a finite sum structure. SVRG was later shown to work for policy evaluation, a problem in reinforcement learning in which one aims to estimate the value function of a given policy. SVRG makes use of gradient estimates at two scales. At the slower scale, SVRG computes a full gradient over the whole dataset, which could lead to prohibitive computation costs. In this work, we show that two variants of SVRG for policy evaluation could significantly diminish the number of gradient calculations while preserving a linear convergence speed. More importantly, our theoretical result implies that one does not need to use the entire dataset in every epoch of SVRG when it is applied to policy evaluation with linear function approximation. Our experiments demonstrate large computational savings provided by the proposed methods.",0

"The technological and scientific challenges involved in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are currently of primary interest for many automobile companies and research labs. However, human-controlled vehicles are likely to remain on the roads for several decades to come and may share with AVs the traffic environments of the future. In such mixed environments, AVs should deploy human-like driving policies and negotiation skills to enable smooth traffic flow. To generate automated human-like driving policies, we introduce a model-free, deep reinforcement learning approach to imitate an experienced human driver's behavior. We study a static obstacle avoidance task on a two-lane highway road in simulation (Unity). Our control algorithm receives a stochastic feedback signal from two sources: a model-driven part, encoding simple driving rules, such as lane-keeping and speed control, and a stochastic, data-driven part, incorporating human expert knowledge from driving data. To assess the similarity between machine and human driving, we model distributions of track position and speed as Gaussian processes. We demonstrate that our approach leads to human-like driving policies.",0

We develop a high-performance MODRL framework that supports both single-policy and multi-policy strategies, as well as both linear and non-linear approaches to action selection. The experimental results on two benchmark problems (two-objective deep sea treasure environment and three-objective Mountain Car problem) indicate that the proposed framework is able to find the Pareto-optimal solutions effectively. The proposed framework is generic and highly modularized, which allows the integration of different deep reinforcement learning algorithms in different complex problem domains. This therefore overcomes many disadvantages involved with standard multi-objective reinforcement learning methods in the current literature. The proposed framework acts as a testbed platform that accelerates the development of MODRL for solving increasingly complicated multi-objective problems.",0

"Nowadays, liquid rocket engines use closed-loop control at most near steady operating conditions. The control of the transient phases is traditionally performed in open-loop due to highly nonlinear system dynamics. This situation is unsatisfactory, in particular for reusable engines. The open-loop control system cannot provide optimal engine performance due to external disturbances or the degeneration of engine components over time. In this paper, we study a deep reinforcement learning approach for optimal control of a generic gas-generator engine's continuous start-up phase. It is shown that the learned policy can reach different steady-state operating points and convincingly adapt to changing system parameters. A quantitative comparison with carefully tuned open-loop sequences and PID controllers is included. The deep reinforcement learning controller achieves the highest performance and requires only minimal computational effort to calculate the control action, which is a big advantage over approaches that require online optimization, such as model predictive control. control.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning has been applied more and more widely nowadays, especially in various complex control tasks. Effective exploration for noisy networks is one of the most important issues in deep reinforcement learning. Noisy networks tend to produce stable outputs for agents. However, this tendency is not always enough to find a stable policy for an agent, which decreases efficiency and stability during the learning process. Based on NoisyNets, this paper proposes an algorithm called NROWAN-DQN, i.e., Noise Reduction and Online Weight Adjustment NoisyNet-DQN. Firstly, we develop a novel noise reduction method for NoisyNet-DQN to make the agent perform stable actions. Secondly, we design an online weight adjustment strategy for noise reduction, which improves stable performance and gets higher scores for the agent. Finally, we evaluate this algorithm in four standard domains and analyze properties of hyper-parameters. Our results show that NROWAN-DQN outperforms prior algorithms in all these domains. In addition, NROWAN-DQN also shows better stability. The variance of the NROWAN-DQN score is significantly reduced, especially in some action-sensitive environments. This means that in some environments where high stability is required, NROWAN-DQN will be more appropriate than NoisyNets-DQN.",0

"With the advent of ride-sharing services, there is a huge increase in the number of people who rely on them for various needs. Most of the earlier approaches tackling this issue required handcrafted functions for estimating travel times and passenger waiting times. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) based methods attempting to solve the ridesharing problem are unable to accurately model the complex environment in which taxis operate. Prior Multi-Agent Deep RL based methods based on Independent DQN (IDQN) learn decentralized value functions prone to instability due to the concurrent learning and exploring of multiple agents. Our proposed method based on QMIX is able to achieve centralized training with decentralized execution. We show that our model performs better than the IDQN baseline on a fixed grid size and is able to generalize well to smaller or larger grid sizes.

"We study reinforcement learning in continuous state and action spaces endowed with a metric. We provide a refined analysis of the algorithm of Sinclair, Banerjee, and Yu (2019) and show that its regret scales with the \emph{zooming dimension} of the instance. This parameter, which originates in the bandit literature, captures the size of the subsets of near optimal actions and is always smaller than the covering dimension used in previous analyses.

"Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been used as a tool for finding failures in autonomous systems. During execution, the RL agents often rely on some domain-specific heuristic reward to guide them towards finding failures, but constructing such a heuristic may be difficult or infeasible. Without a heuristic, the agent may only receive rewards at the time of failure, or even rewards that guide it away from failures. For example, some approaches give rewards for taking more-likely actions, because we want to find more-likely failures. However, the agent may then learn to only take likely actions, and may not be able to find a failure at all. Consequently, the problem becomes a hard-exploration problem, where rewards do not aid exploration. A new algorithm, go-explore (GE), has recently set new records on benchmarks from the hard-exploration field. We apply GE to adaptive stress testing (AST), one example of an RL-based falsification approach that provides a way to search for the most-likely failure scenario. We simulate a scenario where an autonomous vehicle drives while a pedestrian is crossing the road. We demonstrate that GE is able to find failures without domain-specific heuristics, such as the distance between the car and the pedestrian, on scenarios that other RL techniques are unable to solve. Furthermore, inspired by the robustification phase of GE, we demonstrate that the backwards algorithm (BA) improves the failures found by other RL techniques.",0
"The use of reinforcement learning (RL) to detect failures in autonomous systems has gained recent attention. RL agents often require domain-specific heuristic rewards to guide their search for failures, but creating such heuristics can be challenging. Without a heuristic, the agent may only receive rewards when a failure occurs, or even rewards that lead it away from failures. For instance, some methods give rewards for taking more probable actions, but this can cause the agent to only take likely actions and miss potential failures. This results in a hard-exploration problem where rewards do not assist in exploration. A novel algorithm, go-explore (GE), has achieved remarkable results on hard-exploration benchmarks.

"In this paper, we propose a distributed zeroth-order policy optimization method for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Existing MARL algorithms often assume that every agent can observe the states and actions of all the other agents in the network. This can be impractical in large-scale problems, where sharing the state and action information with multi-hop neighbors may incur significant communication overhead. The advantage of the proposed zeroth-order policy optimization method is that it allows the agents to compute the local policy gradients needed to update their local policy functions using local estimates of the global accumulated rewards that depend on partial state and action information only and can be obtained using consensus. Specifically, to calculate the local policy gradients, we develop a new distributed zeroth-order policy gradient estimator that relies on one-point residual-feedback which, compared to existing zeroth-order estimators that also rely on one-point feedback, significantly reduces the variance of the policy gradient estimates improving, in this way, the learning performance. We show that the proposed distributed zeroth-order policy optimization method with constant stepsize converges to a neighborhood of the global optimal policy that depends on the number of consensus steps used to calculate the local estimates of the global accumulated rewards. Moreover, we provide numerical experiments that demonstrate that our new zeroth-order policy gradient estimator is more sample-efficient compared to other existing one-point estimators.",0

"While recent state-of-the-art results for adversarial imitation-learning algorithms are encouraging, recent works exploring the imitation learning from observation (ILO) setting, where trajectories \textit{only} contain expert observations, have not been met with the same success. Inspired by recent investigations of $f$-divergence manipulation for the standard imitation learning setting(Ke et al., 2019; Ghasemipour et al., 2019), we here examine the extent to which variations in the choice of probabilistic divergence may yield more performant ILO algorithms. We unfortunately find that $f$-divergence minimization through reinforcement learning is susceptible to numerical instabilities. We contribute a reparameterization trick for adversarial imitation learning to alleviate the optimization challenges of the promising $f$-divergence minimization framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our design choices allow for ILO algorithms that outperform baseline approaches and more closely match expert performance in low-dimensional continuous-control tasks.",0

However, we discover that using reinforcement learning to minimize $f$-divergence is vulnerable to numerical instabilities. To address this issue, we propose a reparameterization trick for adversarial imitation learning that overcomes the optimization challenges of $f$-divergence minimization. We demonstrate through experiments that our approach outperforms baseline methods and is closer to expert performance in low-dimensional continuous-control tasks.",1

"As humans, our goals and our environment are persistently changing throughout our lifetime based on our experiences, actions, and internal and external drives. In contrast, typical reinforcement learning problem set-ups consider decision processes that are stationary across episodes. Can we develop reinforcement learning algorithms that can cope with the persistent change in the former, more realistic problem settings? While on-policy algorithms such as policy gradients in principle can be extended to non-stationary settings, the same cannot be said for more efficient off-policy algorithms that replay past experiences when learning. In this work, we formalize this problem setting, and draw upon ideas from the online learning and probabilistic inference literature to derive an off-policy RL algorithm that can reason about and tackle such lifelong non-stationarity. Our method leverages latent variable models to learn a representation of the environment from current and past experiences, and performs off-policy RL with this representation. We further introduce several simulation environments that exhibit lifelong non-stationarity, and empirically find that our approach substantially outperforms approaches that do not reason about environment shift.",0

For this setting, we propose an optimistic trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm for which we establish $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^2 A H^4 K})$ regret for stochastic rewards. Furthermore, we prove $\tilde O( \sqrt{ S^2 A H^4 } K^{2/3} ) $ regret for adversarial rewards.

"In most of the transfer learning approaches to reinforcement learning (RL) the distribution over the tasks is assumed to be stationary. Therefore, the target and source tasks are i.i.d. samples of the same distribution.

"Developing mathematical models of dynamic systems is central to many disciplines of engineering and science. Models facilitate simulations, analysis of the system's behavior, decision making and design of automatic control algorithms. Even inherently model-free control techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) have been shown to benefit from the use of models, typically learned online. Any model construction method must address the tradeoff between the accuracy of the model and its complexity, which is difficult to strike. In this paper, we propose to employ symbolic regression (SR) to construct parsimonious process models described by analytic equations. We have equipped our method with two different state-of-the-art SR algorithms which automatically search for equations that fit the measured data: Single Node Genetic Programming (SNGP) and Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP). In addition to the standard problem formulation in the state-space domain, we show how the method can also be applied to input-output models of the NARX (nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input) type. We present the approach on three simulated examples with up to 14-dimensional state space: an inverted pendulum, a mobile robot, and a bipedal walking robot. A comparison with deep neural networks and local linear regression shows that SR in most cases outperforms these commonly used alternative methods. We demonstrate on a real pendulum system that the analytic model found enables a RL controller to successfully perform the swing-up task, based on a model constructed from only 100 data samples.",0

"We consider online learning for episodic stochastically constrained Markov decision processes (CMDP), which plays a central role in ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning. Here the loss function can vary arbitrarily across the episodes, whereas both the loss received and the budget consumption are revealed at the end of each episode. Previous works solve this problem under the restrictive assumption that the transition model of the Markov decision processes (MDP) is known a priori and establish regret bounds that depend polynomially on the cardinalities of the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and the action space $\mathcal{A}$.

"While the identification of nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental building block of model-based reinforcement learning and feedback control, its sample complexity is only understood for systems that either have discrete states and actions or for systems that can be identified from data generated by i.i.d. random inputs. Nonetheless, many interesting dynamical systems have continuous states and actions and can only be identified through a judicious choice of inputs. Motivated by practical settings, we study a class of nonlinear dynamical systems whose state transitions depend linearly on a known feature embedding of state-action pairs. To estimate such systems in finite time identification methods must explore all directions in feature space. We propose an active learning approach that achieves this by repeating three steps: trajectory planning, trajectory tracking, and re-estimation of the system from all available data. We show that our method estimates nonlinear dynamical systems at a parametric rate, similar to the statistical rate of standard linear regression.",0

"We solve active target tracking, one of the essential tasks in autonomous systems, using a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach. In this problem, an autonomous agent is tasked with acquiring information about targets of interests using its onboard sensors. The classical challenges in this problem are system model dependence and the difficulty of computing information-theoretic cost functions for a long planning horizon. RL provides solutions for these challenges as the length of its effective planning horizon does not affect the computational complexity, and it drops the strong dependency of an algorithm on system models. In particular, we introduce Active Tracking Target Network (ATTN), a unified RL policy that is capable of solving major sub-tasks of active target tracking -- in-sight tracking, navigation, and exploration. The policy shows robust behavior for tracking agile and anomalous targets with a partially known target model. Additionally, the same policy is able to navigate in obstacle environments to reach distant targets as well as explore the environment when targets are positioned in unexpected locations.",0

"Intelligent manipulation benefits from the capacity to flexibly control an end-effector with high degrees of freedom (DoF) and dynamically react to the environment.

"We consider the recently proposed reinforcement learning (RL) framework of Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDP), where the agent interacts with a (potentially adversarial) sequence of episodic tabular MDPs. In addition, a context vector determining the MDP parameters is available to the agent at the start of each episode, thereby allowing it to learn a context-dependent near-optimal policy. In this paper, we propose a no-regret online RL algorithm in the setting where the MDP parameters are obtained from the context using generalized linear mappings (GLMs). We propose and analyze optimistic and randomized exploration methods which make (time and space) efficient online updates. The GLM based model subsumes previous work in this area and also improves previous known bounds in the special case where the contextual mapping is linear.

"Sequence generation models are commonly refined with reinforcement learning over user-defined metrics. However, high gradient variance hinders the practical use of this method. To stabilize this method, we adapt to contextual generation of categorical sequences a policy gradient estimator, which evaluates a set of correlated Monte Carlo (MC) rollouts for variance control. Due to the correlation, the number of unique rollouts is random and adaptive to model uncertainty; those rollouts naturally become baselines for each other, and hence are combined to effectively reduce gradient variance. We also demonstrate the use of correlated MC rollouts for binary-tree softmax models, which reduce the high generation cost in large vocabulary scenarios by decomposing each categorical action into a sequence of binary actions. We evaluate our methods on both neural program synthesis and image captioning. The proposed methods yield lower gradient variance and consistent improvement over related baselines.",0
"Reinforcement learning is a common method used to enhance sequence generation models, based on user-defined metrics. However, the high variance that occurs due to steep gradients can make this approach impractical. To address this issue, we propose a policy gradient estimator for contextual generation of categorical sequences, which uses correlated Monte Carlo rollouts to control variance. The number of unique rollouts is adaptable to the model's uncertainty, and since they are correlated, they act as baselines for one another and effectively reduce gradient variance. We also apply this technique to binary-tree softmax models, which can reduce generation costs in large vocabulary scenarios by breaking down categorical actions into a sequence of binary actions. We evaluate our approach on neural program synthesis and image captioning and observe consistently improved results with lower gradient variance compared to related baselines.",1
"Currently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) shows impressive results in complex gaming and robotic environments. Often these results are achieved at the expense of huge computational costs and require an incredible number of episodes of interaction between the agent and the environment. There are two main approaches to improving the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning methods - using hierarchical methods and expert demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a combination of these approaches that allow the agent to use low-quality demonstrations in complex vision-based environments with multiple related goals. Our forgetful experience replay (ForgER) algorithm effectively handles errors in expert data and reduces quality losses when adapting the action space and states representation to the agent's capabilities. Our proposed goal-oriented structuring of replay buffer allows the agent to automatically highlight sub-goals for solving complex hierarchical tasks in demonstrations. Our method is universal and can be integrated into various off-policy methods. It surpasses all known existing state-of-the-art RL methods using expert demonstrations on various model environments. The solution based on our algorithm beats all the solutions for the famous MineRL competition and allows the agent to mine a diamond in the Minecraft environment.",0

"Biopharmaceutical manufacturing faces critical challenges, including complexity, high variability, lengthy lead time, and limited historical data and knowledge of the underlying system stochastic process. To address these challenges, we propose a green simulation assisted model-based reinforcement learning to support process online learning and guide dynamic decision making. Basically, the process model risk is quantified by the posterior distribution. At any given policy, we predict the expected system response with prediction risk accounting for both inherent stochastic uncertainty and model risk. Then, we propose green simulation assisted reinforcement learning and derive the mixture proposal distribution of decision process and likelihood ratio based metamodel for the policy gradient, which can selectively reuse process trajectory outputs collected from previous experiments to increase the simulation data-efficiency, improve the policy gradient estimation accuracy, and speed up the search for the optimal policy. Our numerical study indicates that the proposed approach demonstrates the promising performance.",0

"Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms promise to be applicable in settings where only a fixed data-set (batch) of environment interactions is available and no new experience can be acquired. This property makes these algorithms appealing for real world problems such as robot control. In practice, however, standard off-policy algorithms fail in the batch setting for continuous control. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to this problem. It admits the use of data generated by arbitrary behavior policies and uses a learned prior -- the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) -- to bias the RL policy towards actions that have previously been executed and are likely to be successful on the new task. Our method can be seen as an extension of recent work on batch-RL that enables stable learning from conflicting data-sources.

"Continually solving new, unsolved tasks is the key to learning diverse behaviors. Through reinforcement learning (RL), we have made massive strides towards solving tasks that have a single goal. However, in the multi-task domain, where an agent needs to reach multiple goals, the choice of training goals can largely affect sample efficiency. When biological agents learn, there is often an organized and meaningful order to which learning happens. Inspired by this, we propose setting up an automatic curriculum for goals that the agent needs to solve. Our key insight is that if we can sample goals at the frontier of the set of goals that an agent is able to reach, it will provide a significantly stronger learning signal compared to randomly sampled goals. To operationalize this idea, we introduce a goal proposal module that prioritizes goals that maximize the epistemic uncertainty of the Q-function of the policy. This simple technique samples goals that are neither too hard nor too easy for the agent to solve, hence enabling continual improvement. We evaluate our method across 13 multi-goal robotic tasks and 5 navigation tasks, and demonstrate performance gains over current state-of-the-art methods.",0

"In e-commerce markets, on time delivery is of great importance to customer satisfaction. In this paper, we present a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for deciding how and when orders should be batched and picked in a warehouse to minimize the number of tardy orders. In particular, the technique facilitates making decisions on whether an order should be picked individually (pick-by-order) or picked in a batch with other orders (pick-by-batch), and if so with which other orders. We approach the problem by formulating it as a semi-Markov decision process and develop a vector-based state representation that includes the characteristics of the warehouse system. This allows us to create a deep reinforcement learning solution that learns a strategy by interacting with the environment and solve the problem with a proximal policy optimization algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed DRL approach by comparing it with several batching and sequencing heuristics in different problem settings. The results show that the DRL approach is able to develop a strategy that produces consistent, good solutions and performs better than the proposed heuristics.",0

"Efficient exploration is one of the main challenges in reinforcement learning (RL). Most existing sample-efficient algorithms assume the existence of a single reward function during exploration. In many practical scenarios, however, there is not a single underlying reward function to guide the exploration, for instance, when an agent needs to learn many skills simultaneously, or multiple conflicting objectives need to be balanced. To address these challenges, we propose the \textit{task-agnostic RL} framework: In the exploration phase, the agent first collects trajectories by exploring the MDP without the guidance of a reward function. After exploration, it aims at finding near-optimal policies for $N$ tasks, given the collected trajectories augmented with \textit{sampled rewards} for each task. We present an efficient task-agnostic RL algorithm, \textsc{UCBZero}, that finds $\epsilon$-optimal policies for $N$ arbitrary tasks after at most $\tilde O(\log(N)H^5SA/\epsilon^2)$ exploration episodes. We also provide an $\Omega(\log (N)H^2SA/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound, showing that the $\log$ dependency on $N$ is unavoidable. Furthermore, we provide an $N$-independent sample complexity bound of \textsc{UCBZero} in the statistically easier setting when the ground truth reward functions are known.",0

"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown its advantages in sample-efficiency over model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Despite the impressive results it achieves, it still faces a trade-off between the ease of data generation and model bias. In this paper, we propose a simple and elegant model-embedding model-based reinforcement learning (MEMB) algorithm in the framework of the probabilistic reinforcement learning. To balance the sample-efficiency and model bias, we exploit both real and imaginary data in the training. In particular, we embed the model in the policy update and learn $Q$ and $V$ functions from the real data set. We provide the theoretical analysis of MEMB with the Lipschitz continuity assumption on the model and policy. At last, we evaluate MEMB on several benchmarks and demonstrate our algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",0

"We study the problem of least squares linear regression where the data-points are dependent and are sampled from a Markov chain. We establish sharp information theoretic minimax lower bounds for this problem in terms of $\tau_{\mathsf{mix}}$, the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain, under different noise settings. Our results establish that in general, optimization with Markovian data is strictly harder than optimization with independent data and a trivial algorithm (SGD-DD) that works with only one in every $\tilde{\Theta}(\tau_{\mathsf{mix}})$ samples, which are approximately independent, is minimax optimal. In fact, it is strictly better than the popular Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method with constant step-size which is otherwise minimax optimal in the regression with independent data setting.   Beyond a worst case analysis, we investigate whether structured datasets seen in practice such as Gaussian auto-regressive dynamics can admit more efficient optimization schemes. Surprisingly, even in this specific and natural setting, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with constant step-size is still no better than SGD-DD. Instead, we propose an algorithm based on experience replay--a popular reinforcement learning technique--that achieves a significantly better error rate. Our improved rate serves as one of the first results where an algorithm outperforms SGD-DD on an interesting Markov chain and also provides one of the first theoretical analyses to support the use of experience replay in practice.",0

"Temporal-Difference (TD) learning is a standard and very successful reinforcement learning approach, at the core of both algorithms that learn the value of a given policy, as well as algorithms which learn how to improve policies. TD-learning with eligibility traces provides a way to do temporal credit assignment, i.e. decide which portion of a reward should be assigned to predecessor states that occurred at different previous times, controlled by a parameter $\lambda$. However, tuning this parameter can be time-consuming, and not tuning it can lead to inefficient learning. To improve the sample efficiency of TD-learning, we propose a meta-learning method for adjusting the eligibility trace parameter, in a state-dependent manner. The adaptation is achieved with the help of auxiliary learners that learn distributional information about the update targets online, incurring roughly the same computational complexity per step as the usual value learner. Our approach can be used both in on-policy and off-policy learning. We prove that, under some assumptions, the proposed method improves the overall quality of the update targets, by minimizing the overall target error. This method can be viewed as a plugin which can also be used to assist prediction with function approximation by meta-learning feature (observation)-based $\lambda$ online, or even in the control case to assist policy improvement. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements, as well as improved robustness of the proposed algorithm to learning rate variation.",0

"Reinforcement learning algorithms can acquire policies for complex tasks autonomously. However, the number of samples required to learn a diverse set of skills can be prohibitively large. While meta-reinforcement learning methods have enabled agents to leverage prior experience to adapt quickly to new tasks, their performance depends crucially on how close the new task is to the previously experienced tasks. Current approaches are either not able to extrapolate well, or can do so at the expense of requiring extremely large amounts of data for on-policy meta-training. In this work, we present model identification and experience relabeling (MIER), a meta-reinforcement learning algorithm that is both efficient and extrapolates well when faced with out-of-distribution tasks at test time. Our method is based on a simple insight: we recognize that dynamics models can be adapted efficiently and consistently with off-policy data, more easily than policies and value functions. These dynamics models can then be used to continue training policies and value functions for out-of-distribution tasks without using meta-reinforcement learning at all, by generating synthetic experience for the new task.",0

"Actor-critic (AC) methods have exhibited great empirical success compared with other reinforcement learning algorithms, where the actor uses the policy gradient to improve the learning policy and the critic uses temporal difference learning to estimate the policy gradient. Under the two time-scale learning rate schedule, the asymptotic convergence of AC has been well studied in the literature. However, the non-asymptotic convergence and finite sample complexity of actor-critic methods are largely open. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis for two time-scale actor-critic methods under non-i.i.d. setting. We prove that the actor-critic method is guaranteed to find a first-order stationary point (i.e., $\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta})\|_2^2 \le \epsilon$) of the non-concave performance function $J(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, with $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity.

"The high sample complexity of reinforcement learning challenges its use in practice. A promising approach is to quickly adapt pre-trained policies to new environments.

We propose new model-based mechanisms that are able to make online adaptation in unseen target environments, by combining ideas from no-regret online learning and adaptive control. We prove that the approach learns policies in the target environment that can quickly recover trajectories from the source environment, and establish the rate of convergence in general settings.

"When multiple agents learn in a decentralized manner, the environment appears non-stationary from the perspective of an individual agent due to the exploration and learning of the other agents. Recently proposed deep multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have tried to mitigate this non-stationarity by attempting to determine which samples are from other agent exploration or suboptimality and take them less into account during learning. Based on the same philosophy, this paper introduces a decentralized quantile estimator, which aims to improve performance by distinguishing non-stationary samples based on the likelihood of returns. In particular, each agent considers the likelihood that other agent exploration and policy changes are occurring, essentially utilizing the agent's own estimations to weigh the learning rate that should be applied towards the given samples. We introduce a formal method of calculating differences of our return distribution representations and methods for utilizing it to guide updates. We also explore the effect of risk-seeking strategies for adjusting learning over time and propose adaptive risk distortion functions which guides risk sensitivity. Our experiments, on traditional benchmarks and new domains, show our methods are more stable, sample efficient and more likely to converge to a joint optimal policy than previous methods.",0

"Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies. Hard attention mechanisms are typically non-differentiable. They can be trained with reinforcement learning but the high-variance training this entails hinders more widespread application. We show how hard attention for image classification can be framed as a Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) problem. From this perspective, the optimal locations to attend to are those which provide the greatest expected reduction in the entropy of the classification distribution. We introduce methodology from the BOED literature to approximate this optimal behaviour, and use it to generate `near-optimal' sequences of attention locations. We then show how to use such sequences to partially supervise, and therefore speed up, the training of a hard attention mechanism. Although generating these sequences is computationally expensive, they can be reused by any other networks later trained on the same task.",0

"Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges for detecting adversarial attacks at an early stage. We propose attack-agnostic detection on reinforcement learning-based interactive recommendation systems.

Finally, we study the attack strength and frequency of adversarial examples and evaluate our model on standard datasets with multiple crafting methods. Our extensive experiments show that most adversarial attacks are effective, and both attack strength and attack frequency impact the attack performance.

"Reinforcement learning has achieved great success in various applications. To learn an effective policy for the agent, it usually requires a huge amount of data by interacting with the environment, which could be computational costly and time consuming. To overcome this challenge, the framework called Reinforcement Learning with Expert Demonstrations (RLED) was proposed to exploit the supervision from expert demonstrations. Although the RLED methods can reduce the number of learning iterations, they usually assume the demonstrations are perfect, and thus may be seriously misled by the noisy demonstrations in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to adaptively learn the policy by jointly interacting with the environment and exploiting the expert demonstrations. Specifically, for each step of the demonstration trajectory, we form an instance, and define a joint loss function to simultaneously maximize the expected reward and minimize the difference between agent behaviors and demonstrations. Most importantly, by calculating the expected gain of the value function, we assign each instance with a weight to estimate its potential utility, and thus can emphasize the more helpful demonstrations while filter out noisy ones. Experimental results in various environments with multiple popular reinforcement learning algorithms show that the proposed approach can learn robustly with noisy demonstrations, and achieve higher performance in fewer iterations.",0

"Conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms usually have one single agent learning to solve the task independently. As a result, the agent can only explore a limited part of the state-action space while the learned behavior is highly correlated to the agent's previous experience, making the training prone to a local minimum. In this work, we empower RL with the capability of teamwork and propose a novel non-local policy optimization framework called Diversity-regularized Collaborative Exploration (DiCE). DiCE utilizes a group of heterogeneous agents to explore the environment simultaneously and share the collected experiences. A regularization mechanism is further designed to maintain the diversity of the team and modulate the exploration. We implement the framework in both on-policy and off-policy settings and the experimental results show that DiCE can achieve substantial improvement over the baselines in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general framework for adaptive control, which has proven to be efficient in many domains, e.g., board games, video games or autonomous vehicles. In such problems, an agent faces a sequential decision-making problem where, at every time step, it observes its state, performs an action, receives a reward and moves to a new state. An RL agent learns by trial and error a good policy (or controller) based on observations and numeric reward feedback on the previously performed action. In this chapter, we present the basic framework of RL and recall the two main families of approaches that have been developed to learn a good policy. The first one, which is value-based, consists in estimating the value of an optimal policy, value from which a policy can be recovered, while the other, called policy search, directly works in a policy space. Actor-critic methods can be seen as a policy search technique where the policy value that is learned guides the policy improvement. Besides, we give an overview of some extensions of the standard RL framework, notably when risk-averse behavior needs to be taken into account or when rewards are not available or not known.",0
"RL is a widely applicable adaptive control framework that has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of domains, including board games, video games, and autonomous vehicles. In these scenarios, an agent is faced with a sequential decision-making challenge, whereby it observes its state, takes action, receives a reward, and transitions to a new state at each time step. Through trial and error, an RL agent learns a good policy by leveraging feedback on the rewards obtained from previous actions. In this chapter, we outline the fundamental framework of RL and describe the two main approaches for learning a good policy. The first, referred to as value-based, involves estimating the optimal policy value, from which a policy can be derived. The second, known as policy search, operates directly in the policy space. Actor-critic methods can be viewed as a policy search technique, where the learned policy value guides policy improvement. Additionally, we provide a summary of some extensions to the standard RL framework, such as those that address risk-averse behavior or unknown or unavailable rewards.",1
"Several works have addressed the problem of incorporating constraints in the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, however majority of them can only guarantee the satisfaction of soft constraints. In this work, we address the problem of satisfying hard state constraints in a model-free RL setting with the deterministic system dynamics. The proposed algorithm is developed for the discrete state and action space and utilizes a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) to represent the policy. The state constraints are incorporated in the SVM optimization framework to derive an analytical solution for determining the policy parameters. This final policy converges to a solution which is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints. Additionally, the proposed formulation adheres to the Q-learning framework and thus, also guarantees convergence to the optimal solution. The algorithm is demonstrated with multiple example problems.",0

"In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to reach a set of goals by means of an external reward signal. In the natural world, intelligent organisms learn from internal drives, bypassing the need for external signals, which is beneficial for a wide range of tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose to formulate an intrinsic objective as the mutual information between the goal states and the controllable states. This objective encourages the agent to take control of its environment. Subsequently, we derive a surrogate objective of the proposed reward function, which can be optimized efficiently. Lastly, we evaluate the developed framework in different robotic manipulation and navigation tasks and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A video showing experimental results is available at https://youtu.be/CT4CKMWBYz0",0
"The concept of reinforcement learning involves an agent acquiring the ability to achieve a specific set of objectives through an external reward system. However, in nature, intelligent organisms are capable of learning from their own internal drives, thereby eliminating the need for external signals. This is useful for a multitude of tasks. Building on this notion, we suggest creating an intrinsic objective that measures the mutual information between the controllable states and the goal states. This objective encourages the agent to take control of its surroundings. We then establish a replacement objective for the proposed reward function, which can be optimized with ease. Finally, we evaluate our framework on various robotic navigation and manipulation scenarios and exhibit the effectiveness of our approach in a video available at https://youtu.be/CT4CKMWBYz0.",1
"We introduce an algorithm for model-based hierarchical reinforcement learning to acquire self-contained transition and reward models suitable for probabilistic planning at multiple levels of abstraction. We call this framework Planning with Abstract Learned Models (PALM). By representing subtasks symbolically using a new formal structure, the lifted abstract Markov decision process (L-AMDP), PALM learns models that are independent and modular. Through our experiments, we show how PALM integrates planning and execution, facilitating a rapid and efficient learning of abstract, hierarchical models. We also demonstrate the increased potential for learned models to be transferred to new and related tasks.",0

"Molecular geometry prediction of flexible molecules, or conformer search, is a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry. This task is of great importance for predicting structure-activity relationships for a wide variety of substances ranging from biomolecules to ubiquitous materials. Substantial computational resources are invested in Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics methods to generate diverse and representative conformer sets for medium to large molecules, which are yet intractable to chemoinformatic conformer search methods. We present TorsionNet, an efficient sequential conformer search technique based on reinforcement learning under the rigid rotor approximation. The model is trained via curriculum learning, whose theoretical benefit is explored in detail, to maximize a novel metric grounded in thermodynamics called the Gibbs Score. Our experimental results show that TorsionNet outperforms the highest scoring chemoinformatics method by 4x on large branched alkanes, and by several orders of magnitude on the previously unexplored biopolymer lignin, with applications in renewable energy.",0

"In this paper, we propose SAMBA, a novel framework for safe reinforcement learning that combines aspects from probabilistic modelling, information theory, and statistics. Our method builds upon PILCO to enable active exploration using novel(semi-)metrics for out-of-sample Gaussian process evaluation optimised through a multi-objective problem that supports conditional-value-at-risk constraints. We evaluate our algorithm on a variety of safe dynamical system benchmarks involving both low and high-dimensional state representations. Our results show orders of magnitude reductions in samples and violations compared to state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we provide intuition as to the effectiveness of the framework by a detailed analysis of our active metrics and safety constraints.",0

"In the real world, linguistic agents are also embodied agents: they perceive and act in the physical world. The notion of Language Grounding questions the interactions between language and embodiment: how do learning agents connect or ground linguistic representations to the physical world ? This question has recently been approached by the Reinforcement Learning community under the framework of instruction-following agents. In these agents, behavioral policies or reward functions are conditioned on the embedding of an instruction expressed in natural language. This paper proposes another approach: using language to condition goal generators. Given any goal-conditioned policy, one could train a language-conditioned goal generator to generate language-agnostic goals for the agent. This method allows to decouple sensorimotor learning from language acquisition and enable agents to demonstrate a diversity of behaviors for any given instruction. We propose a particular instantiation of this approach and demonstrate its benefits.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved great success on a wide variety of sequential decision-making tasks. However, many of these algorithms suffer from high sample complexity when learning from scratch using environmental rewards, due to issues such as credit-assignment and high-variance gradients, among others. Transfer learning, in which knowledge gained on a source task is applied to more efficiently learn a different but related target task, is a promising approach to improve the sample complexity in RL. Prior work has considered using pre-trained teacher policies to enhance the learning of the student policy, albeit with the constraint that the teacher and the student MDPs share the state-space or the action-space. In this paper, we propose a new framework for transfer learning where the teacher and the student can have arbitrarily different state- and action-spaces. To handle this mismatch, we produce embeddings which can systematically extract knowledge from the teacher policy and value networks, and blend it into the student networks. To train the embeddings, we use a task-aligned loss and show that the representations could be enriched further by adding a mutual information loss. Using a set of challenging simulated robotic locomotion tasks involving many-legged centipedes, we demonstrate successful transfer learning in situations when the teacher and student have different state- and action-spaces.",0

"Q-learning with value function approximation may have the poor performance because of overestimation bias and imprecise estimate. Specifically, overestimation bias is from the maximum operator over noise estimate, which is exaggerated using the estimate of a subsequent state. Inspired by the recent advance of deep reinforcement learning and Double Q-learning, we introduce the decorrelated double Q-learning (D2Q). Specifically, we introduce the decorrelated regularization item to reduce the correlation between value function approximators, which can lead to less biased estimation and low variance. The experimental results on a suite of MuJoCo continuous control tasks demonstrate that our decorrelated double Q-learning can effectively improve the performance.",0

"Optimization of parameterized policies for reinforcement learning (RL) is an important and challenging problem in artificial intelligence. Among the most common approaches are algorithms based on gradient ascent of a score function representing discounted return. In this paper, we examine the role of these policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms in partially-observable multiagent environments. We show several candidate policy update rules and relate them to a foundation of regret minimization and multiagent learning techniques for the one-shot and tabular cases, leading to previously unknown convergence guarantees. We apply our method to model-free multiagent reinforcement learning in adversarial sequential decision problems (zero-sum imperfect information games), using RL-style function approximation. We evaluate on commonly used benchmark Poker domains, showing performance against fixed policies and empirical convergence to approximate Nash equilibria in self-play with rates similar to or better than a baseline model-free algorithm for zero sum games, without any domain-specific state space reductions.",0

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown impressive performance on domains with visual inputs, in particular various games. However, the agent is usually trained on a fixed environment, e.g. a fixed number of levels. A growing mass of evidence suggests that these trained models fail to generalize to even slight variations of the environments they were trained on. This paper advances the hypothesis that the lack of generalization is partly due to the input representation, and explores how rotation, cropping and translation could increase generality. We show that a cropped, translated and rotated observation can get better generalization on unseen levels of two-dimensional arcade games from the GVGAI framework. The generality of the agents is evaluated on both human-designed and procedurally generated levels.",0

"In this paper, we consider the problem of actor-critic reinforcement learning. Firstly, we extend the actor-critic architecture to actor-critic-N architecture by introducing more critics beyond rewards. Secondly, we combine the reward-based critic with a potential-field-based critic to formulate the proposed potential field guided actor-critic reinforcement learning approach (actor-critic-2). This can be seen as a combination of the model-based gradients and the model-free gradients in policy improvement. State with large potential field often contains a strong prior information, such as pointing to the target at a long distance or avoiding collision by the side of an obstacle. In this situation, we should trust potential-field-based critic more as policy evaluation to accelerate policy improvement, where action policy tends to be guided. For example, in practical application, learning to avoid obstacles should be guided rather than learned by trial and error. State with small potential filed is often lack of information, for example, at the local minimum point or around the moving target. At this time, we should trust reward-based critic as policy evaluation more to evaluate the long-term return. In this case, action policy tends to explore. In addition, potential field evaluation can be combined with planning to estimate a better state value function. In this way, reward design can focus more on the final stage of reward, rather than reward shaping or phased reward. Furthermore, potential field evaluation can make up for the lack of communication in multi-agent cooperation problem, i.e., multi-agent each has a reward-based critic and a relative unified potential-field-based critic with prior information. Thirdly, simplified experiments on predator-prey game demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0
"The paper discusses the actor-critic reinforcement learning problem and proposes an extension to the actor-critic architecture by introducing additional critics beyond rewards. This new approach, called potential field guided actor-critic reinforcement learning (actor-critic-2), combines a reward-based critic with a potential-field-based critic to improve policy evaluation. The potential field-based critic is particularly useful in states with large potential fields, where it provides strong prior information to guide action policy. On the other hand, the reward-based critic is more useful in states with small potential fields, where it can better evaluate long-term returns and encourage exploration. The proposed approach also allows for better reward design and can be applied to multi-agent cooperation problems. Experiments on a predator-prey game demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",1
"Combinatorial optimization algorithms for graph problems are usually designed afresh for each new problem with careful attention by an expert to the problem structure. In this work, we develop a new framework to solve any combinatorial optimization problem over graphs that can be formulated as a single player game defined by states, actions, and rewards, including minimum spanning tree, shortest paths, traveling salesman problem, and vehicle routing problem, without expert knowledge. Our method trains a graph neural network using reinforcement learning on an unlabeled training set of graphs. The trained network then outputs approximate solutions to new graph instances in linear running time. In contrast, previous approximation algorithms or heuristics tailored to NP-hard problems on graphs generally have at least quadratic running time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on both polynomial and NP-hard problems with optimality gaps close to 1, and show that our method is able to generalize well: (i) from training on small graphs to testing on large graphs; (ii) from training on random graphs of one type to testing on random graphs of another type; and (iii) from training on random graphs to running on real world graphs.",0

"In this paper, we demonstrate how to do automated theorem proving in the presence of a large knowledge base of potential premises without learning from human proofs. We suggest an exploration mechanism that mixes in additional premises selected by a tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) based lookup in a deep reinforcement learning scenario. This helps with exploring and learning which premises are relevant for proving a new theorem. Our experiments show that the theorem prover trained with this exploration mechanism outperforms provers that are trained only on human proofs. It approaches the performance of a prover trained by a combination of imitation and reinforcement learning. We perform multiple experiments to understand the importance of the underlying assumptions that make our exploration approach work, thus explaining our design choices.",0

"We consider the challenge of automated steering angle prediction for self driving cars using egocentric road images. In this work, we explore the use of feudal networks, used in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), to devise a vehicle agent to predict steering angles from first person, dash-cam images of the Udacity driving dataset. Our method, Feudal Steering, is inspired by recent work in HRL consisting of a manager network and a worker network that operate on different temporal scales and have different goals. The manager works at a temporal scale that is relatively coarse compared to the worker and has a higher level, task-oriented goal space. Using feudal learning to divide the task into manager and worker sub-networks provides more accurate and robust prediction. Temporal abstraction in driving allows more complex primitives than the steering angle at a single time instance. Composite actions comprise a subroutine or skill that can be re-used throughout the driving sequence. The associated subroutine id is the manager network's goal, so that the manager seeks to succeed at the high level task (e.g. a sharp right turn, a slight right turn, moving straight in traffic, or moving straight unencumbered by traffic). The steering angle at a particular time instance is the worker network output which is regulated by the manager's high level task. We demonstrate state-of-the art steering angle prediction results on the Udacity dataset.",0

The manager network sets high-level goals, while the worker network outputs the steering angle at a specific time instance. Our method outperforms other existing methods in predicting steering angles on the Udacity dataset.",1
"Generalization across environments is critical to the successful application of reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world challenges. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning abstractions that generalize in block MDPs, families of environments with a shared latent state space and dynamics structure over that latent space, but varying observations. We leverage tools from causal inference to propose a method of invariant prediction to learn model-irrelevance state abstractions (MISA) that generalize to novel observations in the multi-environment setting. We prove that for certain classes of environments, this approach outputs with high probability a state abstraction corresponding to the causal feature set with respect to the return. We further provide more general bounds on model error and generalization error in the multi-environment setting, in the process showing a connection between causal variable selection and the state abstraction framework for MDPs. We give empirical evidence that our methods work in both linear and nonlinear settings, attaining improved generalization over single- and multi-task baselines.",0

"Many cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning environments provide agents with a sparse team-based reward, as well as a dense agent-specific reward that incentivizes learning basic skills. Training policies solely on the team-based reward is often difficult due to its sparsity. Furthermore, relying solely on the agent-specific reward is sub-optimal because it usually does not capture the team coordination objective. A common approach is to use reward shaping to construct a proxy reward by combining the individual rewards. However, this requires manual tuning for each environment. We introduce Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL), a split-level training platform that handles the two objectives separately through two optimization processes. An evolutionary algorithm maximizes the sparse team-based objective through neuroevolution on a population of teams. Concurrently, a gradient-based optimizer trains policies to only maximize the dense agent-specific rewards. The gradient-based policies are periodically added to the evolutionary population as a way of information transfer between the two optimization processes. This enables the evolutionary algorithm to use skills learned via the agent-specific rewards toward optimizing the global objective. Results demonstrate that MERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as MADDPG, on a number of difficult coordination benchmarks.",0
"In many cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning situations, agents are rewarded with a sparse team-based reward in addition to a dense agent-specific reward that encourages the learning of essential skills. However, relying solely on the team-based reward is challenging due to its scarcity, while relying solely on the agent-specific reward is not optimal since it does not always capture the team coordination objective. One common solution is to create a proxy reward by combining individual rewards using reward shaping, but this requires manual tuning for each environment. We propose Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL), a training platform that separates the two objectives into two optimization processes. A neuroevolution algorithm maximizes the sparse team-based objective by evolving a population of teams, while a gradient-based optimizer trains policies to maximize the dense agent-specific rewards. The gradient-based policies are periodically added to the evolutionary population, facilitating information transfer between the two processes, allowing the evolutionary algorithm to optimize the global objective using skills acquired via the agent-specific rewards.

"In session-based or sequential recommendation, it is important to consider a number of factors like long-term user engagement, multiple types of user-item interactions such as clicks, purchases etc. The current state-of-the-art supervised approaches fail to model them appropriately. Casting sequential recommendation task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem is a promising direction. A major component of RL approaches is to train the agent through interactions with the environment. However, it is often problematic to train a recommender in an on-line fashion due to the requirement to expose users to irrelevant recommendations. As a result, learning the policy from logged implicit feedback is of vital importance, which is challenging due to the pure off-policy setting and lack of negative rewards (feedback). In this paper, we propose self-supervised reinforcement learning for sequential recommendation tasks. Our approach augments standard recommendation models with two output layers: one for self-supervised learning and the other for RL. The RL part acts as a regularizer to drive the supervised layer focusing on specific rewards(e.g., recommending items which may lead to purchases rather than clicks) while the self-supervised layer with cross-entropy loss provides strong gradient signals for parameter updates. Based on such an approach, we propose two frameworks namely Self-Supervised Q-learning(SQN) and Self-Supervised Actor-Critic(SAC). We integrate the proposed frameworks with four state-of-the-art recommendation models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"When it comes to session-based or sequential recommendation, several factors must be taken into consideration, such as long-term user engagement and various types of user-item interactions. However, current supervised methods do not accurately model these factors. As a result, transforming sequential recommendation into a reinforcement learning problem is a promising direction. Nonetheless, training recommenders online can be problematic due to the need to expose users to irrelevant recommendations. Consequently, self-supervised reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper for sequential recommendation tasks. This approach involves augmenting standard recommendation models with two output layers: one for self-supervised learning and the other for RL. The RL portion serves as a regularizer to direct the supervised layer toward specific rewards, while the self-supervised layer, with cross-entropy loss, supplies strong gradient signals for parameter adjustments. As a result of this approach, two frameworks, Self-Supervised Q-learning(SQN) and Self-Supervised Actor-Critic(SAC), are proposed, which are integrated with four state-of-the-art recommendation models.

"Heretofore, neural networks with external memory are restricted to single memory with lossy representations of memory interactions. A rich representation of relationships between memory pieces urges a high-order and segregated relational memory. In this paper, we propose to separate the storage of individual experiences (item memory) and their occurring relationships (relational memory). The idea is implemented through a novel Self-attentive Associative Memory (SAM) operator. Found upon outer product, SAM forms a set of associative memories that represent the hypothetical high-order relationships between arbitrary pairs of memory elements, through which a relational memory is constructed from an item memory. The two memories are wired into a single sequential model capable of both memorization and relational reasoning. We achieve competitive results with our proposed two-memory model in a diversity of machine learning tasks, from challenging synthetic problems to practical testbeds such as geometry, graph, reinforcement learning, and question answering.",0

"In this paper, we present a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called Distributional Soft Actor Critic (DSAC), which exploits the distributional information of accumulated rewards to achieve better performance. Seamlessly integrating SAC (which uses entropy to encourage exploration) with a principled distributional view of the underlying objective, DSAC takes into consideration the randomness in both action and rewards, and beats the state-of-the-art baselines in several continuous control benchmarks. Moreover, with the distributional information of rewards, we propose a unified framework for risk-sensitive learning, one that goes beyond maximizing only expected accumulated rewards. Under this framework we discuss three specific risk-related metrics: percentile, mean-variance and distorted expectation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that with distribution modeling in RL, the agent performs better for both risk-averse and risk-seeking control tasks.",0

"This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for autonomous robot navigation using semantic observations. The objective is to infer a cost function that explains demonstrated behavior while relying only on the expert's observations and state-control trajectory. We develop a map encoder, which infers semantic class probabilities from the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined as deep neural network over the semantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly observable, the representation parameters can only be optimized by differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost estimate. The error is optimized using a closed-form subgradient computed only over a subset of promising states via a motion planning algorithm. We show that our approach learns to follow traffic rules in the autonomous driving CARLA simulator by relying on semantic observations of cars, sidewalks and road lanes.",0

"We consider the question of learning $Q$-function in a sample efficient manner for reinforcement learning with continuous state and action spaces under a generative model. If $Q$-function is Lipschitz continuous, then the minimal sample complexity for estimating $\epsilon$-optimal $Q$-function is known to scale as ${\Omega}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{d_1+d_2 +2}})$ per classical non-parametric learning theory, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ denote the dimensions of the state and action spaces respectively. The $Q$-function, when viewed as a kernel, induces a Hilbert-Schmidt operator and hence possesses square-summable spectrum. This motivates us to consider a parametric class of $Q$-functions parameterized by its ""rank"" $r$, which contains all Lipschitz $Q$-functions as $r \to \infty$. As our key contribution, we develop a simple, iterative learning algorithm that finds $\epsilon$-optimal $Q$-function with sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{\max(d_1, d_2)+2}})$ when the optimal $Q$-function has low rank $r$ and the discounting factor $\gamma$ is below a certain threshold. Thus, this provides an exponential improvement in sample complexity. To enable our result, we develop a novel Matrix Estimation algorithm that faithfully estimates an unknown low-rank matrix in the $\ell_\infty$ sense even in the presence of arbitrary bounded noise, which might be of interest in its own right. Empirical results on several stochastic control tasks confirm the efficacy of our ""low-rank"" algorithms.",0

"In recent years, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to many different continuous control tasks. While RL algorithms are often conceptually simple, their state-of-the-art implementations take numerous low- and high-level design decisions that strongly affect the performance of the resulting agents. Those choices are usually not extensively discussed in the literature, leading to discrepancy between published descriptions of algorithms and their implementations. This makes it hard to attribute progress in RL and slows down overall progress [Engstrom'20]. As a step towards filling that gap, we implement >50 such ``choices'' in a unified on-policy RL framework, allowing us to investigate their impact in a large-scale empirical study. We train over 250'000 agents in five continuous control environments of different complexity and provide insights and practical recommendations for on-policy training of RL agents.",0

Nevertheless, to fully exploit the potentials of neural networks, we propose an automated searching approach for the optimal training strategy with reinforcement learning. The proposed approach can be utilized for tuning hyper-parameters, and selecting necessary data augmentation with certain probabilities.

"Individuality is essential in human society, which induces the division of labor and thus improves the efficiency and productivity. Similarly, it should also be the key to multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by that individuality is of being an individual separate from others, we propose a simple yet efficient method for the emergence of individuality (EOI) in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). EOI learns a probabilistic classifier that predicts a probability distribution over agents given their observation and gives each agent an intrinsic reward of being correctly predicted by the classifier. The intrinsic reward encourages the agents to visit their own familiar observations, and learning the classifier by such observations makes the intrinsic reward signals stronger and the agents more identifiable. To further enhance the intrinsic reward and promote the emergence of individuality, two regularizers are proposed to increase the discriminability of the classifier. We implement EOI on top of popular MARL algorithms. Empirically, we show that EOI significantly outperforms existing methods in a variety of multi-agent cooperative scenarios.",0

"In reinforcement learning, agents that consider the context, or current state, when selecting source policies for transfer have been shown to outperform context-free approaches. However, none of the existing approaches transfer knowledge contextually from model-based learners to a model-free learner. This could be useful, for instance, when source policies are intentionally learned on diverse simulations with plentiful data but transferred to a real-world setting with limited data. In this paper, we assume knowledge of estimated source task dynamics and policies, and common sub-goals but different dynamics. We introduce a novel deep mixture-of-experts formulation for learning state-dependent beliefs over source task dynamics that match the target dynamics using state trajectories collected from the target task. The mixture model is easy to interpret, demonstrates robustness to estimation errors in dynamics, and is compatible with most learning algorithms. We then show how this model can be incorporated into standard policy reuse frameworks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from OpenAI-Gym.",0

"Discovering causal structure among a set of variables is a fundamental problem in many domains. However, state-of-the-art methods seldom consider the possibility that the observational data has missing values (incomplete data), which is ubiquitous in many real-world situations. The missing value will significantly impair the performance and even make the causal discovery algorithms fail. In this paper, we propose an approach to discover causal structures from incomplete data by using a novel encoder and reinforcement learning (RL). The encoder is designed for missing data imputation as well as feature extraction. In particular, it learns to encode the currently available information (with missing values) into a robust feature representation which is then used to determine where to search the best graph. The encoder is integrated into a RL framework that can be optimized using the actor-critic algorithm. Our method takes the incomplete observational data as input and generates a causal structure graph. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method can robustly generate causal structures from incomplete data. Compared with the direct combination of data imputation and causal discovery methods, our method performs generally better and can even obtain a performance gain as much as 43.2%.",0
"The identification of causal relationships among variables is a fundamental challenge in various fields.

"We consider model selection in stochastic bandit and reinforcement learning problems. Given a set of base learning algorithms, an effective model selection strategy adapts to the best learning algorithm in an online fashion. We show that by estimating the regret of each algorithm and playing the algorithms such that all empirical regrets are ensured to be of the same order, the overall regret balancing strategy achieves a regret that is close to the regret of the optimal base algorithm. Our strategy requires an upper bound on the optimal base regret as input, and the performance of the strategy depends on the tightness of the upper bound. We show that having this prior knowledge is necessary in order to achieve a near-optimal regret. Further, we show that any near-optimal model selection strategy implicitly performs a form of regret balancing.",0

"Model-free deep reinforcement learning is sample inefficient. One hypothesis -- speculated, but not confirmed -- is that catastrophic interference within an environment inhibits learning. We test this hypothesis through a large-scale empirical study in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and, indeed, find supporting evidence. We show that interference causes performance to plateau; the network cannot train on segments beyond the plateau without degrading the policy used to reach there. By synthetically controlling for interference, we demonstrate performance boosts across architectures, learning algorithms and environments. A more refined analysis shows that learning one segment of a game often increases prediction errors elsewhere. Our study provides a clear empirical link between catastrophic interference and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning.",0
"The efficiency of model-free deep reinforcement learning is limited due to its inability to effectively utilize samples. One possible explanation for this limitation is the occurrence of catastrophic interference within the learning environment, which hinders the learning process. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive study in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and discovered evidence to support this claim. Our findings indicate that interference causes performance to level off, preventing the network from learning beyond this point without sacrificing the quality of the policy used to reach that level. By artificially controlling for interference, we observed improved performance across various learning algorithms, architectures, and environments. Additionally, we discovered that learning one segment of a game can lead to prediction errors in other parts of the game. Our study establishes a concrete link between catastrophic interference and the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning.",1
"We consider a distributed system, consisting of a heterogeneous set of devices, ranging from low-end to high-end. These devices have different profiles, e.g., different energy budgets, or different hardware specifications, determining their capabilities on performing certain learning tasks. We propose the first approach that enables distributed learning in such a heterogeneous system. Applying our approach, each device employs a neural network (NN) with a topology that fits its capabilities; however, part of these NNs share the same topology, so that their parameters can be jointly learned. This differs from current approaches, such as federated learning, which require all devices to employ the same NN, enforcing a trade-off between achievable accuracy and computational overhead of training. We evaluate heterogeneous distributed learning for reinforcement learning (RL) and observe that it greatly improves the achievable reward on more powerful devices, compared to current approaches, while still maintaining a high reward on the weaker devices. We also explore supervised learning, observing similar gains.",0

"With reinforcement learning, an agent could learn complex behaviors from high-level abstractions of the task. However, exploration and reward shaping remained challenging for existing methods, especially in scenarios where the extrinsic feedback was sparse. Expert demonstrations have been investigated to solve these difficulties, but a tremendous number of high-quality demonstrations were usually required. In this work, an integrated policy gradient algorithm was proposed to boost exploration and facilitate intrinsic reward learning from only limited number of demonstrations. We achieved this by reformulating the original reward function with two additional terms, where the first term measured the Jensen-Shannon divergence between current policy and the expert, and the second term estimated the agent's uncertainty about the environment. The presented algorithm was evaluated on a range of simulated tasks with sparse extrinsic reward signals where only one single demonstrated trajectory was provided to each task, superior exploration efficiency and high average return were demonstrated in all tasks. Furthermore, it was found that the agent could imitate the expert's behavior and meanwhile sustain high return.",0

"Continual learning with neural networks is an important learning framework in AI that aims to learn a sequence of tasks well. However, it is often confronted with three challenges: (1) overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem, (2) adapt the current network to new tasks, and meanwhile (3) control its model complexity. To reach these goals, we propose a novel approach named as Continual Learning with Efficient Architecture Search, or CLEAS in short. CLEAS works closely with neural architecture search (NAS) which leverages reinforcement learning techniques to search for the best neural architecture that fits a new task. In particular, we design a neuron-level NAS controller that decides which old neurons from previous tasks should be reused (knowledge transfer), and which new neurons should be added (to learn new knowledge). Such a fine-grained controller allows one to find a very concise architecture that can fit each new task well. Meanwhile, since we do not alter the weights of the reused neurons, we perfectly memorize the knowledge learned from previous tasks. We evaluate CLEAS on numerous sequential classification tasks, and the results demonstrate that CLEAS outperforms other state-of-the-art alternative methods, achieving higher classification accuracy while using simpler neural architectures.",0

"Temporal-difference and Q-learning play a key role in deep reinforcement learning, where they are empowered by expressive nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. At the core of their empirical successes is the learned feature representation, which embeds rich observations, e.g., images and texts, into the latent space that encodes semantic structures. Meanwhile, the evolution of such a feature representation is crucial to the convergence of temporal-difference and Q-learning.   In particular, temporal-difference learning converges when the function approximator is linear in a feature representation, which is fixed throughout learning, and possibly diverges otherwise. We aim to answer the following questions: When the function approximator is a neural network, how does the associated feature representation evolve? If it converges, does it converge to the optimal one?   We prove that, utilizing an overparameterized two-layer neural network, temporal-difference and Q-learning globally minimize the mean-squared projected Bellman error at a sublinear rate. Moreover, the associated feature representation converges to the optimal one, generalizing the previous analysis of Cai et al. (2019) in the neural tangent kernel regime, where the associated feature representation stabilizes at the initial one. The key to our analysis is a mean-field perspective, which connects the evolution of a finite-dimensional parameter to its limiting counterpart over an infinite-dimensional Wasserstein space. Our analysis generalizes to soft Q-learning, which is further connected to policy gradient.",0

"Discovering causal structure among a set of variables is a fundamental problem in many empirical sciences. Traditional score-based casual discovery methods rely on various local heuristics to search for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) according to a predefined score function. While these methods, e.g., greedy equivalence search, may have attractive results with infinite samples and certain model assumptions, they are usually less satisfactory in practice due to finite data and possible violation of assumptions. Motivated by recent advances in neural combinatorial optimization, we propose to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to search for the DAG with the best scoring. Our encoder-decoder model takes observable data as input and generates graph adjacency matrices that are used to compute rewards. The reward incorporates both the predefined score function and two penalty terms for enforcing acyclicity. In contrast with typical RL applications where the goal is to learn a policy, we use RL as a search strategy and our final output would be the graph, among all graphs generated during training, that achieves the best reward. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, and show that the proposed approach not only has an improved search ability but also allows a flexible score function under the acyclicity constraint.",0
"In various empirical sciences, identifying the causal structure among a group of variables is a crucial task.

Our encoder-decoder model takes input from observable data and creates graph adjacency matrices that calculate rewards. The reward encompasses both the pre-defined score function and two penalty terms to ensure acyclicity. Unlike conventional RL applications that aim to learn a policy, we employ RL as a search strategy, and our ultimate output will be the graph that attains the best reward among all graphs generated during training. We conduct experiments on both artificial and real datasets, demonstrating that our proposed approach not only improves search capability but also enables flexibility in the score function while adhering to the acyclicity constraint.",1
"Dyna-style reinforcement learning (RL) agents improve sample efficiency over model-free RL agents by updating the value function with simulated experience generated by an environment model. However, it is often difficult to learn accurate models of environment dynamics, and even small errors may result in failure of Dyna agents. In this paper, we investigate one type of model error: hallucinated states. These are states generated by the model, but that are not real states of the environment. We present the Hallucinated Value Hypothesis (HVH): updating values of real states towards values of hallucinated states results in misleading state-action values which adversely affect the control policy. We discuss and evaluate four Dyna variants; three which update real states toward simulated -- and therefore potentially hallucinated -- states and one which does not. The experimental results provide evidence for the HVH thus suggesting a fruitful direction toward developing Dyna algorithms robust to model error.",0

"We consider the problem of reinforcement learning (RL) with unbounded state space motivated by the classical problem of scheduling in a queueing network. Traditional policies as well as error metric that are designed for finite, bounded or compact state space, require infinite samples for providing any meaningful performance guarantee (e.g. $\ell_\infty$ error) for unbounded state space. That is, we need a new notion of performance metric. As the main contribution of this work, inspired by the literature in queuing systems and control theory, we propose stability as the notion of ""goodness"": the state dynamics under the policy should remain in a bounded region with high probability. As a proof of concept, we propose an RL policy using Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle and argue that it satisfies the stability property as long as the system dynamics under the optimal policy respects a Lyapunov function. The assumption of existence of a Lyapunov function is not restrictive as it is equivalent to the positive recurrence or stability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can stabilize the system then it must possess a Lyapunov function. And, our policy does not utilize the knowledge of the specific Lyapunov function. To make our method sample efficient, we provide an improved, sample efficient Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle with Lipschitz value function that may be of interest in its own right. Furthermore, we design an adaptive version of the algorithm, based on carefully constructed statistical tests, which finds the correct tuning parameter automatically.",0

"Recent work in the behavioural sciences has begun to overturn the long-held belief that human decision making is irrational, suboptimal and subject to biases. This turn to the rational suggests that human decision making may be a better source of ideas for constraining how machine learning problems are defined than would otherwise be the case. One promising idea concerns human decision making that is dependent on apparently irrelevant aspects of the choice context. Previous work has shown that by taking into account choice context and making relational observations, people can maximize expected value. Other work has shown that Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a useful way to formulate human-like decision problems. Here, we propose a novel POMDP model for contextual choice tasks and show that, despite the apparent irrationalities, a reinforcement learner can take advantage of the way that humans make decisions. We suggest that human irrationalities may offer a productive source of inspiration for improving the design of AI architectures and machine learning methods.",0

"Policy distillation, which transfers a teacher policy to a student policy has achieved great success in challenging tasks of deep reinforcement learning. This teacher-student framework requires a well-trained teacher model which is computationally expensive. Moreover, the performance of the student model could be limited by the teacher model if the teacher model is not optimal. In the light of collaborative learning, we study the feasibility of involving joint intellectual efforts from diverse perspectives of student models. In this work, we introduce dual policy distillation(DPD), a student-student framework in which two learners operate on the same environment to explore different perspectives of the environment and extract knowledge from each other to enhance their learning. The key challenge in developing this dual learning framework is to identify the beneficial knowledge from the peer learner for contemporary learning-based reinforcement learning algorithms, since it is unclear whether the knowledge distilled from an imperfect and noisy peer learner would be helpful. To address the challenge, we theoretically justify that distilling knowledge from a peer learner will lead to policy improvement and propose a disadvantageous distillation strategy based on the theoretical results. The conducted experiments on several continuous control tasks show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance with a learning-based agent and function approximation without the use of expensive teacher models.",0

However, this framework relies on a well-trained teacher model, which can be computationally expensive, and may limit the performance of the student model if the teacher is not optimal. To address this, we propose dual policy distillation (DPD), a student-student framework where two learners operate on the same environment to extract knowledge from each other, enhancing their learning. The key challenge is identifying beneficial knowledge from a peer learner, given that it may be imperfect and noisy. We justify distilling knowledge from a peer learner, proposing a disadvantageous distillation strategy based on theoretical results. Experiments show that DPD achieves superior performance without expensive teacher models in several continuous control tasks.",1
"Driver distraction a significant risk to driving safety. Apart from spatial domain, research on temporal inattention is also necessary. This paper aims to figure out the pattern of drivers' temporal attention allocation. In this paper, we propose an actor-critic method - Attention-based Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (ATD3) algorithm to approximate a driver' s action according to observations and measure the driver' s attention allocation for consecutive time steps in car-following model. Considering reaction time, we construct the attention mechanism in the actor network to capture temporal dependencies of consecutive observations. In the critic network, we employ Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) to address overestimated value estimates persisting in the actor-critic algorithm. We conduct experiments on real-world vehicle trajectory datasets and show that the accuracy of our proposed approach outperforms seven baseline algorithms. Moreover, the results reveal that the attention of the drivers in smooth vehicles is uniformly distributed in previous observations while they keep their attention to recent observations when sudden decreases of relative speeds occur. This study is the first contribution to drivers' temporal attention and provides scientific support for safety measures in transportation systems from the perspective of data mining.",0

"This paper describes the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to multi-product inventory management in supply chains. The problem description and solution are both adapted from a real-world business solution. The novelty of this problem with respect to supply chain literature is (i) we consider concurrent inventory management of a large number (50 to 1000) of products with shared capacity, (ii) we consider a multi-node supply chain consisting of a warehouse which supplies three stores, (iii) the warehouse, stores, and transportation from warehouse to stores have finite capacities, (iv) warehouse and store replenishment happen at different time scales and with realistic time lags, and (v) demand for products at the stores is stochastic. We describe a novel formulation in a multi-agent (hierarchical) reinforcement learning framework that can be used for parallelised decision-making, and use the advantage actor critic (A2C) algorithm with quantised action spaces to solve the problem. Experiments show that the proposed approach is able to handle a multi-objective reward comprised of maximising product sales and minimising wastage of perishable products.",0

"Policy evaluation algorithms are essential to reinforcement learning due to their ability to predict the performance of a policy. However, there are two long-standing issues lying in this prediction problem that need to be tackled: off-policy stability and on-policy efficiency. The conventional temporal difference (TD) algorithm is known to perform very well in the on-policy setting, yet is not off-policy stable. On the other hand, the gradient TD and emphatic TD algorithms are off-policy stable, but are not on-policy efficient. This paper introduces novel algorithms that are both off-policy stable and on-policy efficient by using the oblique projection method. The empirical experimental results on various domains validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0

"In this paper, we introduce proximal gradient temporal difference learning, which provides a principled way of designing and analyzing true stochastic gradient temporal difference learning algorithms. We show how gradient TD (GTD) reinforcement learning methods can be formally derived, not by starting from their original objective functions, as previously attempted, but rather from a primal-dual saddle-point objective function. We also conduct a saddle-point error analysis to obtain finite-sample bounds on their performance. Previous analyses of this class of algorithms use stochastic approximation techniques to prove asymptotic convergence, and do not provide any finite-sample analysis. We also propose an accelerated algorithm, called GTD2-MP, that uses proximal ``mirror maps'' to yield an improved convergence rate. The results of our theoretical analysis imply that the GTD family of algorithms are comparable and may indeed be preferred over existing least squares TD methods for off-policy learning, due to their linear complexity.

"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) considers settings in which a set of coexisting agents interact with one another and their environment. The adaptation and learning of other agents induces non-stationarity in the environment dynamics. This poses a great challenge for value function-based algorithms whose convergence usually relies on the assumption of a stationary environment. Policy search algorithms also struggle in multi-agent settings as the partial observability resulting from an opponent's actions not being known introduces high variance to policy training. Modelling an agent's opponent(s) is often pursued as a means of resolving the issues arising from the coexistence of learning opponents. An opponent model provides an agent with some ability to reason about other agents to aid its own decision making. Most prior works learn an opponent model by assuming the opponent is employing a stationary policy or switching between a set of stationary policies. Such an approach can reduce the variance of training signals for policy search algorithms. However, in the multi-agent setting, agents have an incentive to continually adapt and learn. This means that the assumptions concerning opponent stationarity are unrealistic. In this work, we develop a novel approach to modelling an opponent's learning dynamics which we term Learning to Model Opponent Learning (LeMOL). We show our structured opponent model is more accurate and stable than naive behaviour cloning baselines. We further show that opponent modelling can improve the performance of algorithmic agents in multi-agent settings.",0

"Offline reinforcement learning, wherein one uses off-policy data logged by a fixed behavior policy to evaluate and learn new policies, is crucial in applications where experimentation is limited such as medicine. We study the estimation of policy value and gradient of a deterministic policy from off-policy data when actions are continuous. Targeting deterministic policies, for which action is a deterministic function of state, is crucial since optimal policies are always deterministic (up to ties). In this setting, standard importance sampling and doubly robust estimators for policy value and gradient fail because the density ratio does not exist. To circumvent this issue, we propose several new doubly robust estimators based on different kernelization approaches. We analyze the asymptotic mean-squared error of each of these under mild rate conditions for nuisance estimators. Specifically, we demonstrate how to obtain a rate that is independent of the horizon length.",0

"We study reinforcement learning in non-episodic factored Markov decision processes (FMDPs). We propose two near-optimal and oracle-efficient algorithms for FMDPs.

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) based methods have seen their paramount successes in solving serial decision-making and control problems in recent years. For conventional RL formulations, Markov Decision Process (MDP) and state-action-value function are the basis for the problem modeling and policy evaluation. However, several challenging issues still remain. Among most cited issues, the enormity of state/action space is an important factor that causes inefficiency in accurately approximating the state-action-value function. We observe that although actions directly define the agents' behaviors, for many problems the next state after a state transition matters more than the action taken, in determining the return of such a state transition. In this regard, we propose a new learning paradigm, State Action Separable Reinforcement Learning (sasRL), wherein the action space is decoupled from the value function learning process for higher efficiency. Then, a light-weight transition model is learned to assist the agent to determine the action that triggers the associated state transition. In addition, our convergence analysis reveals that under certain conditions, the convergence time of sasRL is $O(T^{1/k})$, where $T$ is the convergence time for updating the value function in the MDP-based formulation and $k$ is a weighting factor. Experiments on several gaming scenarios show that sasRL outperforms state-of-the-art MDP-based RL algorithms by up to $75\%$.",0

"We discuss the problem of learning collaborative behaviour through communication in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. A connectivity-driven communication (CDC) algorithm is proposed to address three key aspects: what agents to involve in the communication, what information content to share, and how often to share it. The multi-agent system is modelled as a weighted graph with nodes representing agents. The unknown edge weights reflect the degree of communication between pairs of agents, which depends on a diffusion process on the graph - the heat kernel. An optimal communication strategy, tightly coupled with overall graph topology, is learned end-to-end concurrently with the agents' policy so as to maximise future expected returns. Empirical results show that CDC is capable of superior performance over alternative algorithms for a range of cooperative navigation tasks, and that the learned graph structures can be interpretable.",0

Our approach models the multi-agent system as a weighted graph consisting of nodes that represent agents. The edge weights are unknown and reflect the level of communication between agent pairs, which is determined by a diffusion process known as the heat kernel. By concurrently learning an optimal communication strategy and the agents' policy, we aim to maximize future expected returns, taking into account the overall graph topology. Our experimental results demonstrate that CDC outperforms alternative algorithms in various cooperative navigation tasks and that the learned graph structures are interpretable.",1
"Entropy augmented to reward is known to soften the greedy argmax policy to softmax policy. Entropy augmentation is reformulated and leads to a motivation to introduce an additional entropy term to the objective function in the form of KL-divergence to regularize optimization process. It results in a policy which monotonically improves while interpolating from the current policy to the softmax greedy policy. This policy is used to build a continuously parameterized algorithm which optimize policy and Q-function simultaneously and whose extreme limits correspond to policy gradient and Q-learning, respectively. Experiments show that there can be a performance gain using an intermediate algorithm.",0

"Enterprise Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) consist of multiple Access Points (APs) covering a given area. Finding a suitable network configuration able to maximize the performance of enterprise WLANs is a challenging task given the complex dependencies between APs and stations. Recently, in wireless networking, the use of reinforcement learning techniques has emerged as an effective solution to efficiently explore the impact of different network configurations in the system performance, identifying those that provide better performance. In this paper, we study if Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) are able to offer a feasible solution to the decentralized channel allocation and AP selection problems in Enterprise WLAN scenarios. To do so, we empower APs and stations with agents that, by means of implementing the Thompson sampling algorithm, explore and learn which is the best channel to use, and which is the best AP to associate, respectively. Our evaluation is performed over randomly generated scenarios, which enclose different network topologies and traffic loads. The presented results show that the proposed adaptive framework using MABs outperform the static approach (i.e., using always the initial default configuration, usually random) regardless of the network density and the traffic requirements. Moreover, we show that the use of the proposed framework reduces the performance variability between different scenarios. Results also show that we achieve the same performance (or better) than static strategies with less APs for the same number of stations. Finally, special attention is placed on how the agents interact. Even if the agents operate in a completely independent manner, their decisions have interrelated effects, as they take actions over the same set of channel resources.",0

"Current deep learning based autonomous driving approaches yield impressive results also leading to in-production deployment in certain controlled scenarios. One of the most popular and fascinating approaches relies on learning vehicle controls directly from data perceived by sensors. This end-to-end learning paradigm can be applied both in classical supervised settings and using reinforcement learning. Nonetheless the main drawback of this approach as also in other learning problems is the lack of explainability. Indeed, a deep network will act as a black-box outputting predictions depending on previously seen driving patterns without giving any feedback on why such decisions were taken. While to obtain optimal performance it is not critical to obtain explainable outputs from a learned agent, especially in such a safety critical field, it is of paramount importance to understand how the network behaves. This is particularly relevant to interpret failures of such systems. In this work we propose to train an imitation learning based agent equipped with an attention model. The attention model allows us to understand what part of the image has been deemed most important. Interestingly, the use of attention also leads to superior performance in a standard benchmark using the CARLA driving simulator.",0

"Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning allows one to evaluate novel decision policies without needing to conduct exploration, which is often costly or otherwise infeasible. We consider for the first time the semiparametric efficiency limits of OPE in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where actions, rewards, and states are memoryless. We show existing OPE estimators may fail to be efficient in this setting. We develop a new estimator based on cross-fold estimation of $q$-functions and marginalized density ratios, which we term double reinforcement learning (DRL). We show that DRL is efficient when both components are estimated at fourth-root rates and is also doubly robust when only one component is consistent. We investigate these properties empirically and demonstrate the performance benefits due to harnessing memorylessness.",0

"In this paper, we propose enhancing actor-critic reinforcement learning agents by parameterising the final actor layer which produces the actions in order to accommodate the behaviour discrepancy of different actuators, under different load conditions during interaction with the environment. We propose branching the action producing layer in the actor to learn the tuning parameter controlling the activation layer (e.g. Tanh and Sigmoid). The learned parameters are then used to create tailored activation functions for each actuator. We ran experiments on three OpenAI Gym environments, i.e. Pendulum-v0, LunarLanderContinuous-v2 and BipedalWalker-v2. Results have shown an average of 23.15% and 33.80% increase in total episode reward of the LunarLanderContinuous-v2 and BipedalWalker-v2 environments, respectively. There was no significant improvement in Pendulum-v0 environment but the proposed method produces a more stable actuation signal compared to the state-of-the-art method. The proposed method allows the reinforcement learning actor to produce more robust actions that accommodate the discrepancy in the actuators' response functions. This is particularly useful for real life scenarios where actuators exhibit different response functions depending on the load and the interaction with the environment. This also simplifies the transfer learning problem by fine tuning the parameterised activation layers instead of retraining the entire policy every time an actuator is replaced. Finally, the proposed method would allow better accommodation to biological actuators (e.g. muscles) in biomechanical systems.",0

"Dynamic real-time optimization (DRTO) is a challenging task due to the fact that optimal operating conditions must be computed in real time. The main bottleneck in the industrial application of DRTO is the presence of uncertainty. Many stochastic systems present the following obstacles: 1) plant-model mismatch, 2) process disturbances, 3) risks in violation of process constraints. To accommodate these difficulties, we present a constrained reinforcement learning (RL) based approach. RL naturally handles the process uncertainty by computing an optimal feedback policy. However, no state constraints can be introduced intuitively. To address this problem, we present a chance-constrained RL methodology. We use chance constraints to guarantee the probabilistic satisfaction of process constraints, which is accomplished by introducing backoffs, such that the optimal policy and backoffs are computed simultaneously. Backoffs are adjusted using the empirical cumulative distribution function to guarantee the satisfaction of a joint chance constraint. The advantage and performance of this strategy are illustrated through a stochastic dynamic bioprocess optimization problem, to produce sustainable high-value bioproducts.",0

"Graphs neural networks (GNNs) learn node features by aggregating and combining neighbor information, which have achieved promising performance on many graph tasks. However, GNNs are mostly treated as black-boxes and lack human intelligible explanations. Thus, they cannot be fully trusted and used in certain application domains if GNN models cannot be explained. In this work, we propose a novel approach, known as XGNN, to interpret GNNs at the model-level. Our approach can provide high-level insights and generic understanding of how GNNs work. In particular, we propose to explain GNNs by training a graph generator so that the generated graph patterns maximize a certain prediction of the model.We formulate the graph generation as a reinforcement learning task, where for each step, the graph generator predicts how to add an edge into the current graph. The graph generator is trained via a policy gradient method based on information from the trained GNNs. In addition, we incorporate several graph rules to encourage the generated graphs to be valid. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed methods help understand and verify the trained GNNs.

"Reinforcement learning algorithms have had tremendous successes in online learning settings. However, these successes have relied on low-stakes interactions between the algorithmic agent and its environment. In many settings where RL could be of use, such as health care and autonomous driving, the mistakes made by most online RL algorithms during early training come with unacceptable costs. These settings require developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can operate in the so-called batch setting, where the algorithms must learn from set of data that is fixed, finite, and generated from some (possibly unknown) policy. Evaluating policies different from the one that collected the data is called off-policy evaluation, and naturally poses counter-factual questions. In this project we show how off-policy evaluation and the estimation of treatment effects in causal inference are two approaches to the same problem, and compare recent progress in these two areas.",0
"Online learning settings have seen remarkable achievements through reinforcement learning algorithms, but their efficacy has been limited to situations where the algorithmic agent and its environment engage in low-stakes interactions.

Thus, it becomes essential to develop reinforcement learning algorithms that can function in the batch setting, where the algorithms learn from a fixed, finite set of data generated from some unknown policy. This requires off-policy evaluation, which raises counterfactual questions. Our project demonstrates how off-policy evaluation and the estimation of treatment effects in causal inference are two methods to address this issue, and we compare the latest advancements in these two fields.",1
"Machine learning approaches have seen considerable applications in human movement modeling, but remain limited for motor learning. Motor learning requires accounting for motor variability, and poses new challenges as the algorithms need to be able to differentiate between new movements and variation of known ones. In this short review, we outline existing machine learning models for motor learning and their adaptation capabilities. We identify and describe three types of adaptation: Parameter adaptation in probabilistic models, Transfer and meta-learning in deep neural networks, and Planning adaptation by reinforcement learning. To conclude, we discuss challenges for applying these models in the domain of motor learning support systems.",0
"Although machine learning methods have been widely utilized in modeling human movement, their usefulness in motor learning is somewhat restricted. This is due to the need to factor in motor variability during motor learning, which presents fresh challenges as the algorithms must differentiate between novel movements and variations on established ones. In this brief overview, we examine the current machine learning models for motor learning and their flexibility in adaptation. We recognize and explain three types of adaptation: probabilistic models' parameter adaptation, deep neural networks' transfer and meta-learning, and reinforcement learning's planning adaptation. Finally, we address the difficulties associated with implementing these models in the field of motor learning support systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning can interact with the environment and is suitable for applications in decision control systems. Therefore, we used the reinforcement learning method to establish a foreign exchange transaction, avoiding the long-standing problem of unstable trends in deep learning predictions. In the system design, we optimized the Sure-Fire statistical arbitrage policy, set three different actions, encoded the continuous price over a period of time into a heat-map view of the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and compared the Deep Q Learning (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms. To test feasibility, we analyzed three currency pairs, namely EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and AUD/USD. We trained the data in units of four hours from 1 August 2018 to 30 November 2018 and tested model performance using data between 1 December 2018 and 31 December 2018. The test results of the various models indicated that favorable investment performance was achieved as long as the model was able to handle complex and random processes and the state was able to describe the environment, validating the feasibility of reinforcement learning in the development of trading strategies.",0

"Recent work on exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) has led to a series of increasingly complex solutions to the problem. This increase in complexity often comes at the expense of generality. Recent empirical studies suggest that, when applied to a broader set of domains, some sophisticated exploration methods are outperformed by simpler counterparts, such as {\epsilon}-greedy. In this paper we propose an exploration algorithm that retains the simplicity of {\epsilon}-greedy while reducing dithering. We build on a simple hypothesis: the main limitation of {\epsilon}-greedy exploration is its lack of temporal persistence, which limits its ability to escape local optima. We propose a temporally extended form of {\epsilon}-greedy that simply repeats the sampled action for a random duration. It turns out that, for many duration distributions, this suffices to improve exploration on a large set of domains. Interestingly, a class of distributions inspired by ecological models of animal foraging behaviour yields particularly strong performance.",0

"Goal-conditioned policies are used in order to break down complex reinforcement learning (RL) problems by using subgoals, which can be defined either in state space or in a latent feature space. This can increase the efficiency of learning by using a curriculum, and also enables simultaneous learning and generalization across goals. A crucial requirement of goal-conditioned policies is to be able to determine whether the goal has been achieved. Having a notion of distance to a goal is thus a crucial component of this approach. However, it is not straightforward to come up with an appropriate distance, and in some tasks, the goal space may not even be known a priori. In this work we learn a distance-to-goal estimate which is computed in terms of the number of actions that would need to be carried out in a self-supervised approach. Our method solves complex tasks without prior domain knowledge in the online setting in three different scenarios in the context of goal-conditioned policies a) the goal space is the same as the state space b) the goal space is given but an appropriate distance is unknown and c) the state space is accessible, but only a subset of the state space represents desired goals, and this subset is known a priori. We also propose a goal-generation mechanism as a secondary contribution.",0

"This paper studies model-based reinforcement learning (RL) for regret minimization. We focus on finite-horizon episodic RL where the transition model $P$ belongs to a known family of models $\mathcal{P}$, a special case of which is when models in $\mathcal{P}$ take the form of linear mixtures: $P_{\theta} = \sum_{i=1}^{d} \theta_{i}P_{i}$. We propose a model based RL algorithm that is based on optimism principle: In each episode, the set of models that are `consistent' with the data collected is constructed. The criterion of consistency is based on the total squared error of that the model incurs on the task of predicting \emph{values} as determined by the last value estimate along the transitions. The next value function is then chosen by solving the optimistic planning problem with the constructed set of models. We derive a bound on the regret, which, in the special case of linear mixtures, the regret bound takes the form $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}T})$, where $H$, $T$ and $d$ are the horizon, total number of steps and dimension of $\theta$, respectively. In particular, this regret bound is independent of the total number of states or actions, and is close to a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{HdT})$. For a general model family $\mathcal{P}$, the regret bound is derived using the notion of the so-called Eluder dimension proposed by Russo & Van Roy (2014).",0

"Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) using therapeutic drug/biomarker monitoring offers the opportunity to significantly improve the efficacy and safety of drug therapies. Current strategies comprise model-informed dosing tables or are based on maximum a-posteriori estimates. These approaches, however, lack a quantification of uncertainty and/or consider only part of the available patient-specific information. We propose three novel approaches for MIPD employing Bayesian data assimilation (DA) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) to control neutropenia, the major dose-limiting side effect in anticancer chemotherapy. These approaches have the potential to substantially reduce the incidence of life-threatening grade 4 and subtherapeutic grade 0 neutropenia compared to existing approaches. We further show that RL allows to gain further insights by identifying patient factors that drive dose decisions. Due to its flexibility, the proposed combined DA-RL approach can easily be extended to integrate multiple endpoints or patient-reported outcomes, thereby promising important benefits for future personalized therapies.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning has led to many recent-and groundbreaking-advancements.

To address this, we introduce Acme, a tool to simplify the development of novel RL algorithms that is specifically designed to enable simple agent implementations that can be run at various scales of execution. Our aim is also to make the results of various RL algorithms developed in academia and industrial labs easier to reproduce and extend. To this end we are releasing baseline implementations of various algorithms, created using our framework.

"Robust Reinforcement Learning aims to find the optimal policy with some extent of robustness to environmental dynamics. Existing learning algorithms usually enable the robustness through disturbing the current state or simulating environmental parameters in a heuristic way, which lack quantified robustness to the system dynamics (i.e. transition probability). To overcome this issue, we leverage Wasserstein distance to measure the disturbance to the reference transition kernel. With Wasserstein distance, we are able to connect transition kernel disturbance to the state disturbance, i.e. reduce an infinite-dimensional optimization problem to a finite-dimensional risk-aware problem. Through the derived risk-aware optimal Bellman equation, we show the existence of optimal robust policies, provide a sensitivity analysis for the perturbations, and then design a novel robust learning algorithm--Wasserstein Robust Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm (WRAAC). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified in the Cart-Pole environment.",0

By connecting the disturbance to the state through this metric, we simplify an infinite-dimensional optimization problem to a finite-dimensional risk-aware one.

"Learning with sparse rewards remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially when the aim is to train a policy capable of achieving multiple different goals. To date, the most successful approaches for dealing with multi-goal, sparse reward environments have been model-free RL algorithms. In this work we propose PlanGAN, a model-based algorithm specifically designed for solving multi-goal tasks in environments with sparse rewards. Our method builds on the fact that any trajectory of experience collected by an agent contains useful information about how to achieve the goals observed during that trajectory. We use this to train an ensemble of conditional generative models (GANs) to generate plausible trajectories that lead the agent from its current state towards a specified goal. We then combine these imagined trajectories into a novel planning algorithm in order to achieve the desired goal as efficiently as possible. The performance of PlanGAN has been tested on a number of robotic navigation/manipulation tasks in comparison with a range of model-free reinforcement learning baselines, including Hindsight Experience Replay. Our studies indicate that PlanGAN can achieve comparable performance whilst being around 4-8 times more sample efficient.",0

"Adversarial examples are firstly investigated in the area of computer vision: by adding some carefully designed ''noise'' to the original input image, the perturbed image that cannot be distinguished from the original one by human, can fool a well-trained classifier easily. In recent years, researchers also demonstrated that adversarial examples can mislead deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents on playing video games using image inputs with similar methods. However, although DRL has been more and more popular in the area of intelligent transportation systems, there is little research investigating the impacts of adversarial attacks on them, especially for algorithms that do not take images as inputs. In this work, we investigated several fast methods to generate adversarial examples to significantly degrade the performance of a well-trained DRL- based energy management system of an extended range electric delivery vehicle. The perturbed inputs are low-dimensional state representations and close to the original inputs quantified by different kinds of norms. Our work shows that, to apply DRL agents on real-world transportation systems, adversarial examples in the form of cyber-attack should be considered carefully, especially for applications that may lead to serious safety issues.",0

"When function approximation is deployed in reinforcement learning (RL), the same problem may be formulated in different ways, often by treating a pre-processing step as a part of the environment or as part of the agent. As a consequence, fundamental concepts in RL, such as (optimal) value functions, are not uniquely defined as they depend on where we draw this agent-environment boundary, causing problems in theoretical analyses that provide optimality guarantees. We address this issue via a simple and novel boundary-invariant analysis of Fitted Q-Iteration, a representative RL algorithm, where the assumptions and the guarantees are invariant to the choice of boundary. We also discuss closely related issues on state resetting and Monte-Carlo Tree Search, deterministic vs stochastic systems, imitation learning, and the verifiability of theoretical assumptions from data.",0

"Coverage path planning is a well-studied problem in robotics in which a robot must plan a path that passes through every point in a given area repeatedly, usually with a uniform frequency. To address the scenario in which some points need to be visited more frequently than others, this problem has been extended to non-uniform coverage planning. This paper considers the variant of non-uniform coverage in which the robot does not know the distribution of relevant events beforehand and must nevertheless learn to maximize the rate of detecting events of interest. This continual area sweeping problem has been previously formalized in a way that makes strong assumptions about the environment, and to date only a greedy approach has been proposed. We generalize the continual area sweeping formulation to include fewer environmental constraints, and propose a novel approach based on reinforcement learning in a Semi-Markov Decision Process. This approach is evaluated in an abstract simulation and in a high fidelity Gazebo simulation. These evaluations show significant improvement upon the existing approach in general settings, which is especially relevant in the growing area of service robotics.",0

"There has been an increasing surge of interest on development of advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems as intelligent approaches to learn optimal control policies directly from smart agents' interactions with the environment. Objectives: In a model-free RL method with continuous state-space, typically, the value function of the states needs to be approximated. In this regard, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide an attractive modeling mechanism to approximate the value function using sample transitions. DNN-based solutions, however, suffer from high sensitivity to parameter selection, are prone to overfitting, and are not very sample efficient. A Kalman-based methodology, on the other hand, could be used as an efficient alternative. Such an approach, however, commonly requires a-priori information about the system (such as noise statistics) to perform efficiently. The main objective of this paper is to address this issue. Methods: As a remedy to the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes an innovative Multiple Model Kalman Temporal Difference (MM-KTD) framework, which adapts the parameters of the filter using the observed states and rewards. Moreover, an active learning method is proposed to enhance the sampling efficiency of the system. More specifically, the estimated uncertainty of the value functions are exploited to form the behaviour policy leading to more visits to less certain values, therefore, improving the overall learning sample efficiency. As a result, the proposed MM-KTD framework can learn the optimal policy with significantly reduced number of samples as compared to its DNN-based counterparts. Results: To evaluate performance of the proposed MM-KTD framework, we have performed a comprehensive set of experiments based on three RL benchmarks. Experimental results show superiority of the MM-KTD framework in comparison to its state-of-the-art counterparts.",0

"With advances in reinforcement learning (RL), agents are now being developed in high-stakes application domains such as healthcare and transportation. Explaining the behavior of these agents is challenging, as the environments in which they act have large state spaces, and their decision-making can be affected by delayed rewards, making it difficult to analyze their behavior. To address this problem, several approaches have been developed. Some approaches attempt to convey the $\textit{global}$ behavior of the agent, describing the actions it takes in different states. Other approaches devised $\textit{local}$ explanations which provide information regarding the agent's decision-making in a particular state. In this paper, we combine global and local explanation methods, and evaluate their joint and separate contributions, providing (to the best of our knowledge) the first user study of combined local and global explanations for RL agents. Specifically, we augment strategy summaries that extract important trajectories of states from simulations of the agent with saliency maps which show what information the agent attends to. Our results show that the choice of what states to include in the summary (global information) strongly affects people's understanding of agents: participants shown summaries that included important states significantly outperformed participants who were presented with agent behavior in a randomly set of chosen world-states. We find mixed results with respect to augmenting demonstrations with saliency maps (local information), as the addition of saliency maps did not significantly improve performance in most cases. However, we do find some evidence that saliency maps can help users better understand what information the agent relies on in its decision making, suggesting avenues for future work that can further improve explanations of RL agents.",0

"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn an effective policy directly from repeated interactions with a black-box environment. However in practice, the algorithms often require large amounts of training experience to learn and generalize well. In addition, classic model-free learning ignores the domain information contained in the state transition tuples. Model-based RL, on the other hand, attempts to learn a model of the environment from experience and is substantially more sample efficient, but suffers from significantly large asymptotic bias owing to the imperfect dynamics model. In this paper, we propose a gradient matching algorithm to improve sample efficiency by utilizing target slope information from the dynamics predictor to aid the model-free learner. We demonstrate this by presenting a technique for matching the gradient information from the model-based learner with the model-free component in an abstract low-dimensional space and validate the proposed technique through experimental results that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.",0

Furthermore, we show that with appropriately tuned curriculum learning on the task and rewards, policies are capable of developing multi-modal styles, specifically forehand and backhand stroke, whilst achieving 80\% return rate on a wide range of ball throws. We observe that multi-modality does not require any architectural priors, such as multi-head architectures or hierarchical policies.",0

"Recent work has studied the emergence of language among deep reinforcement learning agents that must collaborate to solve a task. Of particular interest are the factors that cause language to be compositional -- i.e., express meaning by combining words which themselves have meaning. Evolutionary linguists have found that in addition to structural priors like those already studied in deep learning, the dynamics of transmitting language from generation to generation contribute significantly to the emergence of compositionality. In this paper, we introduce these cultural evolutionary dynamics into language emergence by periodically replacing agents in a population to create a knowledge gap, implicitly inducing cultural transmission of language. We show that this implicit cultural transmission encourages the resulting languages to exhibit better compositional generalization.",0

In this study, we introduce cultural evolutionary dynamics by periodically replacing agents in a population to create a knowledge gap. This encourages implicit cultural transmission of language and results in better compositional generalization.",1
"Orthogonal Monte Carlo (OMC) is a very effective sampling algorithm imposing structural geometric conditions (orthogonality) on samples for variance reduction. Due to its simplicity and superior performance as compared to its Quasi Monte Carlo counterparts, OMC is used in a wide spectrum of challenging machine learning applications ranging from scalable kernel methods to predictive recurrent neural networks, generative models and reinforcement learning. However theoretical understanding of the method remains very limited. In this paper we shed new light on the theoretical principles behind OMC, applying theory of negatively dependent random variables to obtain several new concentration results. We also propose a novel extensions of the method leveraging number theory techniques and particle algorithms, called Near-Orthogonal Monte Carlo (NOMC). We show that NOMC is the first algorithm consistently outperforming OMC in applications ranging from kernel methods to approximating distances in probabilistic metric spaces.",0

"In this work we present a novel approach for transfer-guided exploration in reinforcement learning that is inspired by the human tendency to leverage experiences from similar encounters in the past while navigating a new task. Given an optimal policy in a related task-environment, we show that its bisimulation distance from the current task-environment gives a lower bound on the optimal advantage of state-action pairs in the current task-environment. Transfer-guided Exploration (ExTra) samples actions from a Softmax distribution over these lower bounds. In this way, actions with potentially higher optimum advantage are sampled more frequently. In our experiments on gridworld environments, we demonstrate that given access to an optimal policy in a related task-environment, ExTra can outperform popular domain-specific exploration strategies viz. epsilon greedy, Model-Based Interval Estimation - Exploration Bonus (MBIE-EB), Pursuit and Boltzmann in rate of convergence. We further show that ExTra is robust to choices of source task and shows a graceful degradation of performance as the dissimilarity of the source task increases. We also demonstrate that ExTra, when used alongside traditional exploration algorithms, improves their rate of convergence. Thus it is capable of complementing the efficacy of traditional exploration algorithms.",0

"Designing rewards for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is challenging because it needs to convey the desired task, be efficient to optimize, and be easy to compute. The latter is particularly problematic when applying RL to robotics, where detecting whether the desired configuration is reached might require considerable supervision and instrumentation. Furthermore, we are often interested in being able to reach a wide range of configurations, hence setting up a different reward every time might be unpractical. Methods like Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have recently shown promise to learn policies able to reach many goals, without the need of a reward. Unfortunately, without tricks like resetting to points along the trajectory, HER might require many samples to discover how to reach certain areas of the state-space. In this work we investigate different approaches to incorporate demonstrations to drastically speed up the convergence to a policy able to reach any goal, also surpassing the performance of an agent trained with other Imitation Learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show our method can also be used when the available expert trajectories do not contain the actions, which can leverage kinesthetic or third person demonstration. The code is available at https://sites.google.com/view/goalconditioned-il/.",0

"Interventions are central to causal learning and reasoning. Yet ultimately an intervention is an abstraction: an agent embedded in a physical environment (perhaps modeled as a Markov decision process) does not typically come equipped with the notion of an intervention -- its action space is typically ego-centric, without actions of the form `intervene on X'. Such a correspondence between ego-centric actions and interventions would be challenging to hard-code. It would instead be better if an agent learnt which sequence of actions allow it to make targeted manipulations of the environment, and learnt corresponding representations that permitted learning from observation. Here we show how a meta-learning approach can be used to perform causal learning in this challenging setting, where the action-space is not a set of interventions and the observation space is a high-dimensional space with a latent causal structure. A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is used to learn relationships that transfer on observational causal learning tasks. This work shows how advances in deep reinforcement learning and meta-learning can provide intervention-centric causal learning in high-dimensional environments with a latent causal structure.",0
"Causal learning and reasoning depend heavily on interventions. However, interventions themselves are abstract concepts. In a physical environment, an agent may not have the ability to intervene, as their actions are typically self-centered and do not include interventions. It would be difficult to program an agent to understand the connection between ego-centric actions and interventions. Instead, it would be more effective for an agent to learn which actions allow for targeted manipulation of the environment and develop corresponding representations for observational learning. Our study demonstrates how a meta-learning approach can overcome the challenge of learning causality in high-dimensional environments with latent causal structures, where the action-space does not include interventions. Utilizing a meta-reinforcement learning algorithm, we establish relationships that transfer to observational causal learning tasks. This research showcases the potential of deep reinforcement learning and meta-learning to enable intervention-centric causal learning in complex environments.",1
"In this paper, the design of an optimal trajectory for an energy-constrained drone operating in dynamic network environments is studied. In the considered model, a drone base station (DBS) is dispatched to provide uplink connectivity to ground users whose demand is dynamic and unpredictable. In this case, the DBS's trajectory must be adaptively adjusted to satisfy the dynamic user access requests. To this end, a meta-learning algorithm is proposed in order to adapt the DBS's trajectory when it encounters novel environments, by tuning a reinforcement learning (RL) solution. The meta-learning algorithm provides a solution that adapts the DBS in novel environments quickly based on limited former experiences. The meta-tuned RL is shown to yield a faster convergence to the optimal coverage in unseen environments with a considerably low computation complexity, compared to the baseline policy gradient algorithm. Simulation results show that, the proposed meta-learning solution yields a 25% improvement in the convergence speed, and about 10% improvement in the DBS' communication performance, compared to a baseline policy gradient algorithm. Meanwhile, the probability that the DBS serves over 50% of user requests increases about 27%, compared to the baseline policy gradient algorithm.",0

"Training deep reinforcement learning agents on environments with multiple levels / scenes / conditions from the same task, has become essential for many applications aiming to achieve generalization and domain transfer from simulation to the real world. While such a strategy is helpful with generalization, the use of multiple scenes significantly increases the variance of samples collected for policy gradient computations. Current methods continue to view this collection of scenes as a single Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a common value function; however, we argue that it is better to treat the collection as a single environment with multiple underlying MDPs. To this end, we propose a dynamic value estimation (DVE) technique for these multiple-MDP environments, motivated by the clustering effect observed in the value function distribution across different scenes. The resulting agent is able to learn a more accurate and scene-specific value function estimate (and hence the advantage function), leading to a lower sample variance. Our proposed approach is simple to accommodate with several existing implementations (like PPO, A3C) and results in consistent improvements for a range of ProcGen environments and the AI2-THOR framework based visual navigation task.",0

"The slate re-ranking problem considers the mutual influences between items to improve user satisfaction in e-commerce, compared with the point-wise ranking. Previous works either directly rank items by an end to end model, or rank items by a score function that trades-off the point-wise score and the diversity between items. However, there are two main existing challenges that are not well studied: (1) the evaluation of the slate is hard due to the complex mutual influences between items of one slate; (2) even given the optimal evaluation, searching the optimal slate is challenging as the action space is exponentially large. In this paper, we present a novel Generator and Critic slate re-ranking approach, where the Critic evaluates the slate and the Generator ranks the items by the reinforcement learning approach. We propose a Full Slate Critic (FSC) model that considers the real impressed items and avoids the impressed bias of existing models. For the Generator, to tackle the problem of large action space, we propose a new exploration reinforcement learning algorithm, called PPO-Exploration. Experimental results show that the FSC model significantly outperforms the state of the art slate evaluation methods, and the PPO-Exploration algorithm outperforms the existing reinforcement learning methods substantially. The Generator and Critic approach improves both the slate efficiency(4% gmv and 5% number of orders) and diversity in live experiments on one of the largest e-commerce websites in the world.",0

"We present DRLViz, a visual analytics interface to interpret the internal memory of an agent (e.g. a robot) trained using deep reinforcement learning. This memory is composed of large temporal vectors updated when the agent moves in an environment and is not trivial to understand due to the number of dimensions, dependencies to past vectors, spatial/temporal correlations, and co-correlation between dimensions. It is often referred to as a black box as only inputs (images) and outputs (actions) are intelligible for humans. Using DRLViz, experts are assisted to interpret decisions using memory reduction interactions, and to investigate the role of parts of the memory when errors have been made (e.g. wrong direction). We report on DRLViz applied in the context of video games simulators (ViZDoom) for a navigation scenario with item gathering tasks.

"This paper presents a novel neural network training approach for faster convergence and better generalization abilities in deep reinforcement learning. Particularly, we focus on the enhancement of training and evaluation performance in reinforcement learning algorithms by systematically reducing gradient's variance and thereby providing a more targeted learning process. The proposed method which we term as Gradient Monitoring(GM), is an approach to steer the learning in the weight parameters of a neural network based on the dynamic development and feedback from the training process itself. We propose different variants of the GM methodology which have been proven to increase the underlying performance of the model. The one of the proposed variant, Momentum with Gradient Monitoring (M-WGM), allows for a continuous adjustment of the quantum of back-propagated gradients in the network based on certain learning parameters. We further enhance the method with Adaptive Momentum with Gradient Monitoring (AM-WGM) method which allows for automatic adjustment between focused learning of certain weights versus a more dispersed learning depending on the feedback from the rewards collected. As a by-product, it also allows for automatic derivation of the required deep network sizes during training as the algorithm automatically freezes trained weights. The approach is applied to two discrete (Multi-Robot Co-ordination problem and Atari games) and one continuous control task (MuJoCo) using Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) respectively.

"One critical prerequisite for the deployment of reinforcement learning systems in the real world is the ability to reliably detect situations on which the agent was not trained.

"Transfer Learning (TL) has shown great potential to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) by leveraging prior knowledge from past learned policies of relevant tasks. Existing transfer approaches either explicitly computes the similarity between tasks or select appropriate source policies to provide guided explorations for the target task. However, how to directly optimize the target policy by alternatively utilizing knowledge from appropriate source policies without explicitly measuring the similarity is currently missing. In this paper, we propose a novel Policy Transfer Framework (PTF) to accelerate RL by taking advantage of this idea. Our framework learns when and which source policy is the best to reuse for the target policy and when to terminate it by modeling multi-policy transfer as the option learning problem. PTF can be easily combined with existing deep RL approaches. Experimental results show it significantly accelerates the learning process and surpasses state-of-the-art policy transfer methods in terms of learning efficiency and final performance in both discrete and continuous action spaces.",0

"Transferring as fast as possible the functioning of our brain to artificial intelligence is an ambitious goal that would help advance the state of the art in AI and robotics. It is in this perspective that we propose to start from hypotheses derived from an empirical study in a human-robot interaction and to verify if they are validated in the same way for children as for a basic reinforcement learning algorithm. Thus, we check whether receiving help from an expert when solving a simple close-ended task (the Towers of Hano\""i) allows to accelerate or not the learning of this task, depending on whether the intervention is canonical or requested by the player. Our experiences have allowed us to conclude that, whether requested or not, a Q-learning algorithm benefits in the same way from expert help as children do.",0

"With widespread applications of artificial intelligence (AI), the capabilities of the perception, understanding, decision-making and control for autonomous systems have improved significantly in the past years. When autonomous systems consider the performance of accuracy and transferability, several AI methods, like adversarial learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and meta-learning, show their powerful performance. Here, we review the learning-based approaches in autonomous systems from the perspectives of accuracy and transferability. Accuracy means that a well-trained model shows good results during the testing phase, in which the testing set shares a same task or a data distribution with the training set. Transferability means that when a well-trained model is transferred to other testing domains, the accuracy is still good.

"Policy gradient is a generic and flexible reinforcement learning approach that generally enjoys simplicity in analysis, implementation, and deployment. In the last few decades, this approach has been extensively advanced for fully observable environments. In this paper, we generalize a variety of these advances to partially observable settings, and similar to the fully observable case, we keep our focus on the class of Markovian policies. We propose a series of technical tools, including a novel notion of advantage function, to develop policy gradient algorithms and study their convergence properties in such environments. Deploying these tools, we generalize a variety of existing theoretical guarantees, such as policy gradient and convergence theorems, to partially observable domains, those which also could be carried to more settings of interest. This study also sheds light on the understanding of policy gradient approaches in real-world applications which tend to be partially observable.",0

"In Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning, an agent learns to achieve multiple goals with a goal-conditioned policy. During learning, the agent first collects the trajectories into a replay buffer, and later these trajectories are selected randomly for replay. However, the achieved goals in the replay buffer are often biased towards the behavior policies. From a Bayesian perspective, when there is no prior knowledge about the target goal distribution, the agent should learn uniformly from diverse achieved goals. Therefore, we first propose a novel multi-goal RL objective based on weighted entropy. This objective encourages the agent to maximize the expected return, as well as to achieve more diverse goals. Secondly, we developed a maximum entropy-based prioritization framework to optimize the proposed objective. For evaluation of this framework, we combine it with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, both with or without Hindsight Experience Replay.

However, in previous work, the experience was replayed at random, without considering which episode might be the most valuable for learning. In this paper, we develop an energy-based framework for prioritizing hindsight experience in robotic manipulation tasks. Our approach is inspired by the work-energy principle in physics. We define a trajectory energy function as the sum of the transition energy of the target object over the trajectory. We hypothesize that replaying episodes that have high trajectory energy is more effective for reinforcement learning in robotics. To verify our hypothesis, we designed a framework for hindsight experience prioritization based on the trajectory energy of goal states. The trajectory energy function takes the potential, kinetic, and rotational energy into consideration. We evaluate our Energy-Based Prioritization (EBP) approach on four challenging robotic manipulation tasks in simulation. Our empirical results show that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both performance and sample-efficiency on all four tasks, without increasing computational time.

"Robotic insertion tasks are characterized by contact and friction mechanics, making them challenging for conventional feedback control methods due to unmodeled physical effects. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for learning control policies in such settings. However, RL can be unsafe during exploration and might require a large amount of real-world training data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, we study how to use meta-reinforcement learning to solve the bulk of the problem in simulation by solving a family of simulated industrial insertion tasks and then adapt policies quickly in the real world. We demonstrate our approach by training an agent to successfully perform challenging real-world insertion tasks using less than 20 trials of real-world experience.

"In the physical design of integrated circuits, global and detailed routing are critical stages involving the determination of the interconnected paths of each net on a circuit while satisfying the design constraints. Existing actual routers as well as routability predictors either have to resort to expensive approaches that lead to high computational times, or use heuristics that do not generalize well. Even though new, learning-based routing methods have been proposed to address this need, requirements on labelled data and difficulties in addressing complex design rule constraints have limited their adoption in advanced technology node physical design problems. In this work, we propose a new router: attention router, which is the first attempt to solve the track-assignment detailed routing problem using reinforcement learning. Complex design rule constraints are encoded into the routing algorithm and an attention-model-based REINFORCE algorithm is applied to solve the most critical step in routing: sequencing device pairs to be routed. The attention router and its baseline genetic router are applied to solve different commercial advanced technologies analog circuits problem sets. The attention router demonstrates generalization ability to unseen problems and is also able to achieve more than 100 times acceleration over the genetic router without significantly compromising the routing solution quality. We also discover a similarity between the attention router and the baseline genetic router in terms of positive correlations in cost and routing patterns, which demonstrate the attention router's ability to be utilized not only as a detailed router but also as a predictor for routability and congestion.",0

"The kind of closed-loop verification likely to be required for autonomous vehicle (AV) safety testing is beyond the reach of traditional test methodologies and discrete verification. Validation puts the autonomous vehicle system to the test in scenarios or situations that the system would likely encounter in everyday driving after its release. These scenarios can either be controlled directly in a physical (closed-course proving ground) or virtual (simulation of predefined scenarios) environment, or they can arise spontaneously during operation in the real world (open-road testing or simulation of randomly generated scenarios).   In AV testing, simulation serves primarily two purposes: to assist the development of a robust autonomous vehicle and to test and validate the AV before release. A challenge arises from the sheer number of scenario variations that can be constructed from each of the above sources due to the high number of variables involved (most of which are continuous). Even with continuous variables discretized, the possible number of combinations becomes practically infeasible to test. To overcome this challenge we propose using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate failure examples and unexpected traffic situations for the AV software implementation. Although reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved notable results in games and some robotic manipulations, this technique has not been widely scaled up to the more challenging real world applications like autonomous driving.",0

"Automatic search of neural architectures for various vision and natural language tasks is becoming a prominent tool as it allows to discover high-performing structures on any dataset of interest. Nevertheless, on more difficult domains, such as dense per-pixel classification, current automatic approaches are limited in their scope - due to their strong reliance on existing image classifiers they tend to search only for a handful of additional layers with discovered architectures still containing a large number of parameters. In contrast, in this work we propose a novel solution able to find light-weight and accurate segmentation architectures starting from only few blocks of a pre-trained classification network. To this end, we progressively build up a methodology that relies on templates of sets of operations, predicts which template and how many times should be applied at each step, while also generating the connectivity structure and downsampling factors. All these decisions are being made by a recurrent neural network that is rewarded based on the score of the emitted architecture on the holdout set and trained using reinforcement learning.

"Lane-change maneuvers are commonly executed by drivers to follow a certain routing plan, overtake a slower vehicle, adapt to a merging lane ahead, etc. However, improper lane change behaviors can be a major cause of traffic flow disruptions and even crashes. While many rule-based methods have been proposed to solve lane change problems for autonomous driving, they tend to exhibit limited performance due to the uncertainty and complexity of the driving environment. Machine learning-based methods offer an alternative approach, as Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising success in many application domains including robotic manipulation, navigation, and playing video games. However, applying DRL to autonomous driving still faces many practical challenges in terms of slow learning rates, sample inefficiency, and safety concerns. In this study, we propose an automated lane change strategy using proximal policy optimization-based deep reinforcement learning, which shows great advantages in learning efficiency while still maintaining stable performance. The trained agent is able to learn a smooth, safe, and efficient driving policy to make lane-change decisions (i.e. when and how) in a challenging situation such as dense traffic scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed policy is validated by using metrics of task success rate and collision rate. The simulation results demonstrate the lane change maneuvers can be efficiently learned and executed in a safe, smooth, and efficient manner.",0

"Greedy-GQ is an off-policy two timescale algorithm for optimal control in reinforcement learning. This paper develops the first finite-sample analysis for the Greedy-GQ algorithm with linear function approximation under Markovian noise. Our finite-sample analysis provides theoretical justification for choosing stepsizes for this two timescale algorithm for faster convergence in practice, and suggests a trade-off between the convergence rate and the quality of the obtained policy. Our paper extends the finite-sample analyses of two timescale reinforcement learning algorithms from policy evaluation to optimal control, which is of more practical interest. Specifically, in contrast to existing finite-sample analyses for two timescale methods, e.g., GTD, GTD2 and TDC, where their objective functions are convex, the objective function of the Greedy-GQ algorithm is non-convex. Moreover, the Greedy-GQ algorithm is also not a linear two-timescale stochastic approximation algorithm.

Since searching an optimal BPE is extremely time-consuming as it requires to train a large number of networks for evaluation, we propose a Minimum Importance Pruning (MIP) approach. Given a dataset and a BPE search space, MIP estimates the importance of hyper-parameters using random forest and subsequently prunes the minimum one from the next iteration. In this way, MIP effectively prunes less important hyper-parameters to allocate more computational resource on more important ones, thus achieving an effective exploration.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn optimal decisions in the presence of a stationary environment. However, the stationary assumption on the environment is very restrictive. In many real world problems like traffic signal control, robotic applications, one often encounters situations with non-stationary environments and in these scenarios, RL methods yield sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we thus consider the problem of developing RL methods that obtain optimal decisions in a non-stationary environment. The goal of this problem is to maximize the long-term discounted reward achieved when the underlying model of the environment changes over time. To achieve this, we first adapt a change point algorithm to detect change in the statistics of the environment and then develop an RL algorithm that maximizes the long-run reward accrued. We illustrate that our change point method detects change in the model of the environment effectively and thus facilitates the RL algorithm in maximizing the long-run reward. We further validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on non-stationary random Markov decision processes, a sensor energy management problem and a traffic signal control problem.",0

The aim of these methods is to enable autonomous agents to adapt to varying conditions by minimizing lost rewards or by finding a suitable policy for efficient system operation. This paper presents a survey of such RL techniques, categorized by their relative merits and demerits. Additionally, we review works tailored to specific application domains and discuss future directions for this field.",1
"Using privileged information during training can improve the sample efficiency and performance of machine learning systems. This paradigm has been applied to reinforcement learning (RL), primarily in the form of distillation or auxiliary tasks, and less commonly in the form of augmenting the inputs of agents. In this work, we investigate Privileged Information Dropout (\pid) for achieving the latter which can be applied equally to value-based and policy-based RL algorithms. Within a simple partially-observed environment, we demonstrate that \pid outperforms alternatives for leveraging privileged information, including distillation and auxiliary tasks, and can successfully utilise different types of privileged information. Finally, we analyse its effect on the learned representations.",0

"Instance segmentation is one of the actively studied research topics in computer vision in which many objects of interest should be separated individually. While many feed-forward networks produce high-quality segmentation on different types of images, their results often suffer from topological errors (merging or splitting) for segmentation of many objects, requiring post-processing. Existing iterative methods, on the other hand, extract a single object at a time using discriminative knowledge-based properties (shapes, boundaries, etc.) without relying on post-processing, but they do not scale well. To exploit the advantages of conventional single-object-per-step segmentation methods without impairing the scalability, we propose a novel iterative deep reinforcement learning agent that learns how to differentiate multiple objects in parallel. Our reward function for the trainable agent is designed to favor grouping pixels belonging to the same object using a graph coloring algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently perform instance segmentation of many objects without heavy post-processing.",0

"Although the challenge of the device connection is much relieved in 5G networks, the training latency is still an obstacle preventing Federated Learning (FL) from being largely adopted. One of the most fundamental problems that lead to large latency is the bad candidate-selection for FL. In the dynamic environment, the mobile devices selected by the existing reactive candidate-selection algorithms very possibly fail to complete the training and reporting phases of FL, because the FL parameter server only knows the currently-observed resources of all candidates. To this end, we study the proactive candidate-selection for FL in this paper. We first let each candidate device predict the qualities of both its training and reporting phases locally using LSTM. Then, the proposed candidateselection algorithm is implemented by the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. Finally, the real-world trace-driven experiments prove that the proposed approach outperforms the existing reactive algorithms",0
"Although 5G networks have made device connection less challenging, the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) is still hindered by training latency. This is primarily due to poor candidate-selection for FL which results in selected mobile devices failing to complete the training and reporting phases.

In this paper, we propose a proactive candidate-selection approach that employs LSTM to enable each candidate device to predict the qualities of both its training and reporting phases locally. The Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework is then used to implement the proposed candidate-selection algorithm. Our real-world trace-driven experiments demonstrate that the proactive approach outperforms existing reactive algorithms.",1
"Intelligent agents need a physical understanding of the world to predict the impact of their actions in the future. While learning-based models of the environment dynamics have contributed to significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, they typically fail to generalize to system states beyond the training data, while often grounding their predictions on non-interpretable latent variables.   We introduce Interactive Differentiable Simulation (IDS), a differentiable physics engine, that allows for efficient, accurate inference of physical properties of rigid-body systems. Integrated into deep learning architectures, our model is able to accomplish system identification using visual input, leading to an interpretable model of the world whose parameters have physical meaning. We present experiments showing automatic task-based robot design and parameter estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems by automatically calculating gradients in IDS. When integrated into an adaptive model-predictive control algorithm, our approach exhibits orders of magnitude improvements in sample efficiency over model-free reinforcement learning algorithms on challenging nonlinear control domains.",0

"We consider un-discounted reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov decision processes (MDPs) under temporal drifts, ie, both the reward and state transition distributions are allowed to evolve over time, as long as their respective total variations, quantified by suitable metrics, do not exceed certain variation budgets. This setting captures the endogeneity, exogeneity, uncertainty, and partial feedback in sequential decision-making scenarios, and finds applications in vehicle remarketing and real-time bidding. We first develop the Sliding Window Upper-Confidence bound for Reinforcement Learning with Confidence Widening (SWUCRL2-CW) algorithm, and establish its dynamic regret bound when the variation budgets are known. In addition, we propose the Bandit-over-Reinforcement Learning (BORL) algorithm to adaptively tune the SWUCRL2-CW algorithm to achieve the same dynamic regret bound, but in a parameter-free manner, ie, without knowing the variation budgets. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to show that our proposed algorithms achieve superior empirical performance compared to existing algorithms.   Notably, the interplay between endogeneity and exogeneity presents a unique challenge, absent in existing (stationary and non-stationary) stochastic online learning settings, when we apply the conventional Optimism in Face of Uncertainty principle to design algorithms with provably low dynamic regret for RL in drifting MDPs. We overcome the challenge by a novel confidence widening technique that incorporates additional optimism into our learning algorithms to ensure low dynamic regret bounds. To extend our theoretical findings, we apply our framework to inventory control problems, and demonstrate how one can alternatively leverage special structures on the state transition distributions to bypass the difficulty in exploring time-varying environments.",0

"Extending the capabilities of robotics to real-world complex, unstructured environments requires the need of developing better perception systems while maintaining low sample complexity. When dealing with high-dimensional state spaces, current methods are either model-free or model-based based on reconstruction objectives. The sample inefficiency of the former constitutes a major barrier for applying them to the real-world. The later, while they present low sample complexity, they learn latent spaces that need to reconstruct every single detail of the scene. In real environments, the task typically just represents a small fraction of the scene. Reconstruction objectives suffer in such scenarios as they capture all the unnecessary components. In this work, we present MIRO, an information theoretic representational learning algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning. We design a latent space that maximizes the mutual information with the future information while being able to capture all the information needed for planning. We show that our approach is more robust than reconstruction objectives in the presence of distractors and cluttered scenes",0

In this paper, we show how to make more effective use of the model by exploiting its differentiability. We construct a policy optimization algorithm that uses the pathwise derivative of the learned model and policy across future timesteps. Instabilities of learning across many timesteps are prevented by using a terminal value function, learning the policy in an actor-critic fashion. Furthermore, we present a derivation on the monotonic improvement of our objective in terms of the gradient error in the model and value function.

"In many settings (e.g., robotics) demonstrations provide a natural way to specify tasks; however, most methods for learning from demonstrations either do not provide guarantees that the artifacts learned for the tasks, such as rewards or policies, can be safely composed and/or do not explicitly capture history dependencies. Motivated by this deficit, recent works have proposed learning Boolean task specifications, a class of Boolean non-Markovian rewards which admit well-defined composition and explicitly handle historical dependencies. This work continues this line of research by adapting maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning to estimate the posteriori probability of a specification given a multi-set of demonstrations. The key algorithmic insight is to leverage the extensive literature and tooling on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams to efficiently encode a time unrolled Markov Decision Process. This enables transforming a naive exponential time algorithm into a polynomial time algorithm.",0

"Temporal-Difference (TD) learning is a standard and very successful reinforcement learning approach, at the core of both algorithms that learn the value of a given policy, as well as algorithms which learn how to improve policies. TD-learning with eligibility traces provides a way to boost sample efficiency by temporal credit assignment, i.e. deciding which portion of a reward should be assigned to predecessor states that occurred at different previous times, controlled by a parameter $\lambda$. However, tuning this parameter can be time-consuming, and not tuning it can lead to inefficient learning. For better sample efficiency of TD-learning, we propose a meta-learning method for adjusting the eligibility trace parameter, in a state-dependent manner. The adaptation is achieved with the help of auxiliary learners that learn distributional information about the update targets online, incurring roughly the same computational complexity per step as the usual value learner. Our approach can be used both in on-policy and off-policy learning. We prove that, under some assumptions, the proposed method improves the overall quality of the update targets, by minimizing the overall target error. This method can be viewed as a plugin to assist prediction with function approximation by meta-learning feature (observation)-based $\lambda$ online, or even in the control case to assist policy improvement. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements, as well as improved robustness of the proposed algorithm to learning rate variation.",0

"Fatigue is the most vital factor of road fatalities and one manifestation of fatigue during driving is drowsiness. In this paper, we propose using deep Q-learning to analyze an electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset captured during a simulated endurance driving test.

We adapt the terminologies in the driving test to fit the reinforcement learning framework, thus formulate the drowsiness estimation problem as an optimization of a Q-learning task. By referring to the latest deep Q-Learning technologies and attending to the characteristics of EEG data, we tailor a deep Q-network for action proposition that can indirectly estimate drowsiness. Our results show that the trained model can trace the variations of mind state in a satisfactory way against the testing EEG data, which demonstrates the feasibility and practicability of this new computation paradigm.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics is challenging due to the difficulty in hand-engineering a dense cost function, which can lead to unintended behavior, and dynamical uncertainty, which makes exploration and constraint satisfaction challenging. We address these issues with a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, Safety Augmented Value Estimation from Demonstrations (SAVED), which uses supervision that only identifies task completion and a modest set of suboptimal demonstrations to constrain exploration and learn efficiently while handling complex constraints. We then compare SAVED with 3 state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms on 6 standard simulation benchmarks involving navigation and manipulation and a physical knot-tying task on the da Vinci surgical robot. Results suggest that SAVED outperforms prior methods in terms of success rate, constraint satisfaction, and sample efficiency, making it feasible to safely learn a control policy directly on a real robot in less than an hour. For tasks on the robot, baselines succeed less than 5% of the time while SAVED has a success rate of over 75% in the first 50 training iterations.

"Existing on-policy imitation learning algorithms, such as DAgger, assume access to a fixed supervisor. However, there are many settings where the supervisor may evolve during policy learning, such as a human performing a novel task or an improving algorithmic controller. We formalize imitation learning from a ""converging supervisor"" and provide sublinear static and dynamic regret guarantees against the best policy in hindsight with labels from the converged supervisor, even when labels during learning are only from intermediate supervisors. We then show that this framework is closely connected to a class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms known as dual policy iteration (DPI), which alternate between training a reactive learner with imitation learning and a model-based supervisor with data from the learner.

"Modern reinforcement learning algorithms can learn solutions to increasingly difficult control problems while at the same time reduce the amount of prior knowledge needed for their application. One of the remaining challenges is the definition of reward schemes that appropriately facilitate exploration without biasing the solution in undesirable ways, and that can be implemented on real robotic systems without expensive instrumentation. In this paper we focus on a setting in which goal tasks are defined via simple sparse rewards, and exploration is facilitated via agent-internal auxiliary tasks. We introduce the idea of simple sensor intentions (SSIs) as a generic way to define auxiliary tasks. SSIs reduce the amount of prior knowledge that is required to define suitable rewards. They can further be computed directly from raw sensor streams and thus do not require expensive and possibly brittle state estimation on real systems. We demonstrate that a learning system based on these rewards can solve complex robotic tasks in simulation and in real world settings. In particular, we show that a real robotic arm can learn to grasp and lift and solve a Ball-in-a-Cup task from scratch, when only raw sensor streams are used for both controller input and in the auxiliary reward definition.",0
"Reinforcement learning algorithms in modern times have the ability to solve control problems that are increasingly difficult, while also decreasing the need for prior knowledge during application. Nonetheless, the challenge that remains is devising reward systems that enable exploration without causing any undue bias in the solution, and can be implemented on robotic systems without requiring expensive instrumentation. This paper concentrates on a scenario where simple sparse rewards are used to define goal tasks, and the exploration is encouraged by auxiliary tasks that are internal to the agent. Simple sensor intentions (SSIs) are proposed as a universal way to define auxiliary tasks, which helps decrease the requirement for prior knowledge to define appropriate rewards. Additionally, they can be directly computed from raw sensor streams, making state estimation redundant and costly for actual systems. We demonstrate that a learning system based on these rewards can successfully complete complicated robotic tasks in both simulation and real-world settings. Specifically, we prove that a real robotic arm can learn to grasp and lift, and solve the Ball-in-a-Cup task from the ground up, while employing raw sensor streams for both controller input and in the auxiliary reward definition.",1
"Many real-world problems require trading off multiple competing objectives.

We propose to learn an action distribution for each objective, and we use supervised learning to fit a parametric policy to a combination of these distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging high-dimensional real and simulated robotics tasks, and show that setting different preferences in our framework allows us to trace out the space of nondominated solutions.",0

"Traditional distributed deep reinforcement learning (RL) commonly relies on exchanging the experience replay memory (RM) of each agent. Since the RM contains all state observations and action policy history, it may incur huge communication overhead while violating the privacy of each agent. Alternatively, this article presents a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving distributed RL framework, coined federated reinforcement distillation (FRD). In FRD, each agent exchanges its proxy experience replay memory (ProxRM), in which policies are locally averaged with respect to proxy states clustering actual states. To provide FRD design insights, we present ablation studies on the impact of ProxRM structures, neural network architectures, and communication intervals. Furthermore, we propose an improved version of FRD, coined mixup augmented FRD (MixFRD), in which ProxRM is interpolated using the mixup data augmentation algorithm. Simulations in a Cartpole environment validate the effectiveness of MixFRD in reducing the variance of mission completion time and communication cost, compared to the benchmark schemes, vanilla FRD, federated reinforcement learning (FRL), and policy distillation (PD).",0

"Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising approach to tackle long-horizon decision-making problems with sparse rewards. Unfortunately, most methods still decouple the lower-level skill acquisition process and the training of a higher level that controls the skills in a new task. Leaving the skills fixed can lead to significant sub-optimality in the transfer setting. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to discover a set of skills, and continuously adapt them along with the higher level even when training on a new task. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we derive a new hierarchical policy gradient with an unbiased latent-dependent baseline, and we introduce Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HiPPO), an on-policy method to efficiently train all levels of the hierarchy jointly. Second, we propose a method for training time-abstractions that improves the robustness of the obtained skills to environment changes.

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), i.e., the development of more transparent and interpretable AI models, has gained increased traction over the last few years. This is due to the fact that, in conjunction with their growth into powerful and ubiquitous tools, AI models exhibit one detrimential characteristic: a performance-transparency trade-off. This describes the fact that the more complex a model's inner workings, the less clear it is how its predictions or decisions were achieved. But, especially considering Machine Learning (ML) methods like Reinforcement Learning (RL) where the system learns autonomously, the necessity to understand the underlying reasoning for their decisions becomes apparent. Since, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no single work offering an overview of Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) methods, this survey attempts to address this gap. We give a short summary of the problem, a definition of important terms, and offer a classification and assessment of current XRL methods. We found that a) the majority of XRL methods function by mimicking and simplifying a complex model instead of designing an inherently simple one, and b) XRL (and XAI) methods often neglect to consider the human side of the equation, not taking into account research from related fields like psychology or philosophy. Thus, an interdisciplinary effort is needed to adapt the generated explanations to a (non-expert) human user in order to effectively progress in the field of XRL and XAI in general.",0

"Neurons in the brain communicate with each other through discrete action spikes as opposed to continuous signal transmission in artificial neural networks. Therefore, the traditional techniques for optimization of parameters in neural networks which rely on the assumption of differentiability of activation functions are no longer applicable to modeling the learning processes in the brain. In this project, we propose biologically-plausible alternatives to backpropagation to facilitate the training of spiking neural networks. We primarily focus on investigating the candidacy of reinforcement learning (RL) rules in solving the spatial and temporal credit assignment problems to enable decision-making in complex tasks. In one approach, we consider each neuron in a multi-layer neural network as an independent RL agent forming a different representation of the feature space while the network as a whole forms the representation of the complex policy to solve the task at hand. In other approach, we apply the reparameterization trick to enable differentiation through stochastic transformations in spiking neural networks. We compare and contrast the two approaches by applying them to traditional RL domains such as gridworld, cartpole and mountain car. Further we also suggest variations and enhancements to enable future research in this area.",0

The network as a whole, however, represents the complex policy required to solve the given task. In another approach, we use the reparameterization trick to facilitate differentiation through stochastic transformations in spiking neural networks. To compare and contrast the two methods, we apply them to classic RL domains such as gridworld, cartpole, and mountain car. Additionally, we suggest variations and enhancements to enable further research in this field.",1
"The control of nonlinear dynamical systems remains a major challenge for autonomous agents. Current trends in reinforcement learning (RL) focus on complex representations of dynamics and policies, which have yielded impressive results in solving a variety of hard control tasks. However, this new sophistication and extremely over-parameterized models have come with the cost of an overall reduction in our ability to interpret the resulting policies. In this paper, we take inspiration from the control community and apply the principles of hybrid switching systems in order to break down complex dynamics into simpler components. We exploit the rich representational power of probabilistic graphical models and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for learning a sequence model to capture the temporal structure of the data and automatically decompose nonlinear dynamics into stochastic switching linear dynamical systems. Moreover, we show how this framework of switching models enables extracting hierarchies of Markovian and auto-regressive locally linear controllers from nonlinear experts in an imitation learning scenario.",0

"Our brain receives a dynamically changing stream of sensorimotor data. Yet, we perceive a rather organized world, which we segment into and perceive as events. Computational theories of cognitive science on event-predictive cognition suggest that our brain forms generative, event-predictive models by segmenting sensorimotor data into suitable chunks of contextual experiences. Here, we introduce a hierarchical, surprise-gated recurrent neural network architecture, which models this process and develops compact compressions of distinct event-like contexts. The architecture contains a contextual LSTM layer, which develops generative compressions of ongoing and subsequent contexts. These compressions are passed into a GRU-like layer, which uses surprise signals to update its recurrent latent state. The latent state is passed forward into another LSTM layer, which processes actual dynamic sensory flow in the light of the provided latent, contextual compression signals. Our model shows to develop distinct event compressions and achieves the best performance on multiple event processing tasks. The architecture may be very useful for the further development of resource-efficient learning, hierarchical model-based reinforcement learning, as well as the development of artificial event-predictive cognition and intelligence.",0

"In recent years deep neural networks have been successfully applied to the domains of reinforcement learning \cite{bengio2009learning,krizhevsky2012imagenet,hinton2006reducing}. Deep reinforcement learning \cite{mnih2015human} is reported to have the advantage of learning effective policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs over traditional agents. However, within the scope of the literature, there is no fundamental change or improvement on the existing training framework. Here we propose a novel training framework that is conceptually comprehensible and potentially easy to be generalized to all feasible algorithms for reinforcement learning. We employ Monte-carlo sampling to achieve raw data inputs, and train them in batch to achieve Markov decision process sequences and synchronously update the network parameters instead of experience replay. This training framework proves to optimize the unbiased approximation of loss function whose estimation exactly matches the real probability distribution data inputs follow, and thus have overwhelming advantages of sample efficiency and convergence rate over existing deep reinforcement learning after evaluating it on both discrete action spaces and continuous control problems. Besides, we propose several algorithms embedded with our new framework to deal with typical discrete and continuous scenarios.

"Fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) addresses the problem of retrieving a particular photo instance given a user's query sketch. Its widespread applicability is however hindered by the fact that drawing a sketch takes time, and most people struggle to draw a complete and faithful sketch. In this paper, we reformulate the conventional FG-SBIR framework to tackle these challenges, with the ultimate goal of retrieving the target photo with the least number of strokes possible. We further propose an on-the-fly design that starts retrieving as soon as the user starts drawing. To accomplish this, we devise a reinforcement learning-based cross-modal retrieval framework that directly optimizes rank of the ground-truth photo over a complete sketch drawing episode. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward scheme that circumvents the problems related to irrelevant sketch strokes, and thus provides us with a more consistent rank list during the retrieval. We achieve superior early-retrieval efficiency over state-of-the-art methods and alternative baselines on two publicly available fine-grained sketch retrieval datasets.",0

"Human players in professional team sports achieve high level coordination by dynamically choosing complementary skills and executing primitive actions to perform these skills. As a step toward creating intelligent agents with this capability for fully cooperative multi-agent settings, we propose a two-level hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm with unsupervised skill discovery. Agents learn useful and distinct skills at the low level via independent Q-learning, while they learn to select complementary latent skill variables at the high level via centralized multi-agent training with an extrinsic team reward. The set of low-level skills emerges from an intrinsic reward that solely promotes the decodability of latent skill variables from the trajectory of a low-level skill, without the need for hand-crafted rewards for each skill. For scalable decentralized execution, each agent independently chooses latent skill variables and primitive actions based on local observations. Our overall method enables the use of general cooperative MARL algorithms for training high level policies and single-agent RL for training low level skills. Experiments on a stochastic high dimensional team game show the emergence of useful skills and cooperative team play. The interpretability of the learned skills show the promise of the proposed method for achieving human-AI cooperation in team sports games.",0

"As an important type of reinforcement learning algorithms, actor-critic (AC) and natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithms are often executed in two ways for finding optimal policies. In the first nested-loop design, actor's one update of policy is followed by an entire loop of critic's updates of the value function, and the finite-sample analysis of such AC and NAC algorithms have been recently well established. The second two time-scale design, in which actor and critic update simultaneously but with different learning rates, has much fewer tuning parameters than the nested-loop design and is hence substantially easier to implement. Although two time-scale AC and NAC have been shown to converge in the literature, the finite-sample convergence rate has not been established. In this paper, we provide the first such non-asymptotic convergence rate for two time-scale AC and NAC under Markovian sampling and with actor having general policy class approximation. We show that two time-scale AC requires the overall sample complexity at the order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5}\log^3(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary point, and two time-scale NAC requires the overall sample complexity at the order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4}\log^2(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate global optimal point. We develop novel techniques for bounding the bias error of the actor due to dynamically changing Markovian sampling and for analyzing the convergence rate of the linear critic with dynamically changing base functions and transition kernel.",0

"We study episodic reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes when the agent receives additional feedback per step in the form of several transition observations. Such additional observations are available in a range of tasks through extended sensors or prior knowledge about the environment (e.g., when certain actions yield similar outcome). We formalize this setting using a feedback graph over state-action pairs and show that model-based algorithms can leverage the additional feedback for more sample-efficient learning. We give a regret bound that, ignoring logarithmic factors and lower-order terms, depends only on the size of the maximum acyclic subgraph of the feedback graph, in contrast with a polynomial dependency on the number of states and actions in the absence of a feedback graph. Finally, we highlight challenges when leveraging a small dominating set of the feedback graph as compared to the bandit setting and propose a new algorithm that can use knowledge of such a dominating set for more sample-efficient learning of a near-optimal policy.",0

Such within-writer variation throws a challenge for automatic writer inspection, where the state-of-the-art methods do not perform well. To deal with intra-variability, we analyze the idiosyncrasy in individual handwriting. We identify/verify the writer from highly idiosyncratic text-patches. Such patches are detected using a deep recurrent reinforcement learning-based architecture. An idiosyncratic score is assigned to every patch, which is predicted by employing deep regression analysis. For writer identification, we propose a deep neural architecture, which makes the final decision by the idiosyncratic score-induced weighted average of patch-based decisions.

"We focus on the challenge of finding a diverse collection of quality solutions on complex continuous domains. While quality diver-sity (QD) algorithms like Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) and MAP-Elites are designed to generate a diverse range of solutions, these algorithms require a large number of evaluations for exploration of continuous spaces. Meanwhile, variants of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are among the best-performing derivative-free optimizers in single-objective continuous domains. This paper proposes a new QD algorithm called Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME). Our new algorithm combines the self-adaptation techniques of CMA-ES with archiving and mapping techniques for maintaining diversity in QD. Results from experiments based on standard continuous optimization benchmarks show that CMA-ME finds better-quality solutions than MAP-Elites; similarly, results on the strategic game Hearthstone show that CMA-ME finds both a higher overall quality and broader diversity of strategies than both CMA-ES and MAP-Elites. Overall, CMA-ME more than doubles the performance of MAP-Elites using standard QD performance metrics. These results suggest that QD algorithms augmented by operators from state-of-the-art optimization algorithms can yield high-performing methods for simultaneously exploring and optimizing continuous search spaces, with significant applications to design, testing, and reinforcement learning among other domains.",0

"An important goal in reinforcement learning is to create agents that can quickly adapt to new goals while avoiding situations that might cause damage to themselves or their environments. One way agents learn is through exploration mechanisms, which are needed to discover new policies. However, in deep reinforcement learning, exploration is normally done by injecting noise in the action space. While performing well in many domains, this setup has the inherent risk that the noisy actions performed by the agent lead to unsafe states in the environment. Here we introduce a novel approach called Meta-Learned Instinctual Networks (MLIN) that allows agents to safely learn during their lifetime while avoiding potentially hazardous states. At the core of the approach is a plastic network trained through reinforcement learning and an evolved ""instinctual"" network, which does not change during the agent's lifetime but can modulate the noisy output of the plastic network. We test our idea on a simple 2D navigation task with no-go zones, in which the agent has to learn to approach new targets during deployment. MLIN outperforms standard meta-trained networks and allows agents to learn to navigate to new targets without colliding with any of the no-go zones. These results suggest that meta-learning augmented with an instinctual network is a promising new approach for safe AI, which may enable progress in this area on a variety of different domains.",0

"This paper tests the hypothesis that modeling a scene in terms of entities and their local interactions, as opposed to modeling the scene globally, provides a significant benefit in generalizing to physical tasks in a combinatorial space the learner has not encountered before. We present object-centric perception, prediction, and planning (OP3), which to the best of our knowledge is the first fully probabilistic entity-centric dynamic latent variable framework for model-based reinforcement learning that acquires entity representations from raw visual observations without supervision and uses them to predict and plan. OP3 enforces entity-abstraction -- symmetric processing of each entity representation with the same locally-scoped function -- which enables it to scale to model different numbers and configurations of objects from those in training. Our approach to solving the key technical challenge of grounding these entity representations to actual objects in the environment is to frame this variable binding problem as an inference problem, and we develop an interactive inference algorithm that uses temporal continuity and interactive feedback to bind information about object properties to the entity variables. On block-stacking tasks, OP3 generalizes to novel block configurations and more objects than observed during training, outperforming an oracle model that assumes access to object supervision and achieving two to three times better accuracy than a state-of-the-art video prediction model that does not exhibit entity abstraction.",0

"Deep learning inference is increasingly run at the edge. As the programming and system stack support becomes mature, it enables acceleration opportunities within a mobile system, where the system performance envelope is scaled up with a plethora of programmable co-processors. Thus, intelligent services designed for mobile users can choose between running inference on the CPU or any of the co-processors on the mobile system, or exploiting connected systems, such as the cloud or a nearby, locally connected system. By doing so, the services can scale out the performance and increase the energy efficiency of edge mobile systems. This gives rise to a new challenge - deciding when inference should run where. Such execution scaling decision becomes more complicated with the stochastic nature of mobile-cloud execution, where signal strength variations of the wireless networks and resource interference can significantly affect real-time inference performance and system energy efficiency. To enable accurate, energy-efficient deep learning inference at the edge, this paper proposes AutoScale. AutoScale is an adaptive and light-weight execution scaling engine built upon the custom-designed reinforcement learning algorithm. It continuously learns and selects the most energy-efficient inference execution target by taking into account characteristics of neural networks and available systems in the collaborative cloud-edge execution environment while adapting to the stochastic runtime variance. Real system implementation and evaluation, considering realistic execution scenarios, demonstrate an average of 9.8 and 1.6 times energy efficiency improvement for DNN edge inference over the baseline mobile CPU and cloud offloading, while meeting the real-time performance and accuracy requirement.",0

"Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) works well when experience can be collected cheaply and model-based RL is effective when system dynamics can be modeled accurately. However, both assumptions can be violated in real world problems such as robotics, where querying the system can be expensive and real-world dynamics can be difficult to model. In contrast to RL, Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms use a simulator to optimize a simple policy class online, constructing a closed-loop controller that can effectively contend with real-world dynamics. MPC performance is usually limited by factors such as model bias and the limited horizon of optimization. In this work, we present a novel theoretical connection between information theoretic MPC and entropy regularized RL and develop a Q-learning algorithm that can leverage biased models. We validate the proposed algorithm on sim-to-sim control tasks to demonstrate the improvements over optimal control and reinforcement learning from scratch.

"Neural networks are effective function approximators, but hard to train in the reinforcement learning (RL) context mainly because samples are correlated. For years, scholars have got around this by employing experience replay or an asynchronous parallel-agent system. This paper proposes Discrete-to-Deep Supervised Policy Learning (D2D-SPL) for training neural networks in RL. D2D-SPL discretises the continuous state space into discrete states and uses actor-critic to learn a policy. It then selects from each discrete state an input value and the action with the highest numerical preference as an input/target pair. Finally it uses input/target pairs from all discrete states to train a classifier. D2D-SPL uses a single agent, needs no experience replay and learns much faster than state-of-the-art methods. We test our method with two RL environments, the Cartpole and an aircraft manoeuvring simulator.",0

"We consider the problem of demand-side energy management, where each household is equipped with a smart meter that is able to schedule home appliances online. The goal is to minimise the overall cost under a real-time pricing scheme. While previous works have introduced centralised approaches, we formulate the smart grid environment as a Markov game, where each household is a decentralised agent, and the grid operator produces a price signal that adapts to the energy demand. The main challenge addressed in our approach is partial observability and perceived non-stationarity of the environment from the viewpoint of each agent. We propose a multi-agent extension of a deep actor-critic algorithm that shows success in learning in this environment. This algorithm learns a centralised critic that coordinates training of all agents. Our approach thus uses centralised learning but decentralised execution. Simulation results show that our online deep reinforcement learning method can reduce both the peak-to-average ratio of total energy consumed and the cost of electricity for all households based purely on instantaneous observations and a price signal.",0

The algorithm learns a centralized critic that coordinates training for all agents, while decentralizing execution. Our simulation results demonstrate that our online deep reinforcement learning method can reduce both the peak-to-average ratio of energy consumption and the cost of electricity for all households based solely on instantaneous observations and a price signal.",1
"Combinatorial optimization is frequently used in computer vision. For instance, in applications like semantic segmentation, human pose estimation and action recognition, programs are formulated for solving inference in Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to produce a structured output that is consistent with visual features of the image. However, solving inference in CRFs is in general intractable, and approximation methods are computationally demanding and limited to unary, pairwise and hand-crafted forms of higher order potentials. In this paper, we show that we can learn program heuristics, i.e., policies, for solving inference in higher order CRFs for the task of semantic segmentation, using reinforcement learning. Our method solves inference tasks efficiently without imposing any constraints on the form of the potentials. We show compelling results on the Pascal VOC and MOTS datasets.",0

"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been shown to be valuable for constructing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for network data. They allow determining if a flow is malicious or not already before it is over, making it possible to take action immediately. However, considering the large number of packets that has to be inspected, for example in cloud/fog and edge computing, the question of computational efficiency arises. We show that by using a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach called SparseIDS, we can reduce the number of consumed packets by more than three fourths while keeping classification accuracy high. To minimize the computational expenses of the RL-based sampling we show that a shared neural network can be used for both the classifier and the RL logic. Thus, no additional resources are consumed by the sampling in deployment. Comparing to various other sampling techniques, SparseIDS consistently achieves higher classification accuracy by learning to sample only relevant packets. A major novelty of our RL-based approach is that it can not only skip up to a predefined maximum number of samples like other approaches proposed in the domain of Natural Language Processing but can even skip arbitrarily many packets in one step. This enables saving even more computational resources for long sequences. Inspecting SparseIDS's behavior of choosing packets shows that it adopts different sampling strategies for different attack types and network flows. Finally we build an automatic steering mechanism that can guide SparseIDS in deployment to achieve a desired level of sparsity.",0

"We present a generic and flexible Reinforcement Learning (RL) based meta-learning framework for the problem of few-shot learning.

"Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a class of algorithms in Reinforcement learning (RL), which tries to imitate an expert without taking any reward from the environment and does not provide expert behavior directly to the policy training. Rather, an agent learns a policy distribution that minimizes the difference from expert behavior in an adversarial setting. Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) leverages the idea of AIL, integrates a reward function approximation along with learning the policy, and shows the utility of IRL in the transfer learning setting. But the reward function approximator that enables transfer learning does not perform well in imitation tasks. We propose an Off-Policy Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Off-policy-AIRL) algorithm which is sample efficient as well as gives good imitation performance compared to the state-of-the-art AIL algorithm in the continuous control tasks. For the same reward function approximator, we show the utility of learning our algorithm over AIL by using the learned reward function to retrain the policy over a task under significant variation where expert demonstrations are absent.",0
"AIL is a type of algorithm in RL that seeks to replicate the behavior of an expert, without relying on external rewards or providing direct guidance to policy training.

However, the reward function approximator is not effective for imitation tasks. To address this issue, we propose an Off-Policy Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithm that is both efficient and produces better imitation performance than the current state-of-the-art AIL algorithm for continuous control tasks. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by training the algorithm to learn a reward function that can be used to retrain the policy for tasks with significant variation in the absence of expert demonstrations.",1

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with continuous action spaces is often approached by directly training parametric policies along the direction of estimated policy gradients (PGs). Previous research revealed that the performance of these PG algorithms depends heavily on the bias-variance tradeoffs involved in estimating and using PGs. A notable approach towards balancing this tradeoff is to merge both on-policy and off-policy gradient estimations. However existing PG merging methods can be sample inefficient and are not suitable to train deterministic policies directly. To address these issues, this paper introduces elite PGs and strengthens their variance reduction effect by adopting elitism and policy consolidation techniques to regularize policy training based on policy behavioral knowledge extracted from elite trajectories. Meanwhile, we propose a two-step method to merge elite PGs and conventional PGs as a new extension of the conventional interpolation merging method. At both the theoretical and experimental levels, we show that both two-step merging and interpolation merging can induce varied bias-variance tradeoffs during policy training. They enable us to effectively use elite PGs and mitigate their performance impact on trained policies. Our experiments also show that two-step merging can outperform interpolation merging and several state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark control tasks.",0

"We propose expected policy gradients (EPG), which unify stochastic policy gradients (SPG) and deterministic policy gradients (DPG) for reinforcement learning. Inspired by expected sarsa, EPG integrates (or sums) across actions when estimating the gradient, instead of relying only on the action in the sampled trajectory. For continuous action spaces, we first derive a practical result for Gaussian policies and quadratic critics and then extend it to a universal analytical method, covering a broad class of actors and critics, including Gaussian, exponential families, and policies with bounded support. For Gaussian policies, we introduce an exploration method that uses covariance proportional to the matrix exponential of the scaled Hessian of the critic with respect to the actions. For discrete action spaces, we derive a variant of EPG based on softmax policies. We also establish a new general policy gradient theorem, of which the stochastic and deterministic policy gradient theorems are special cases. Furthermore, we prove that EPG reduces the variance of the gradient estimates without requiring deterministic policies and with little computational overhead. Finally, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation of EPG and show that it outperforms existing approaches on multiple challenging control domains.",0

"One major obstacle that precludes the success of reinforcement learning in real-world applications is the lack of robustness, either to model uncertainties or external disturbances, of the trained policies. Robustness is critical when the policies are trained in simulations instead of real world environment. In this work, we propose a risk-aware algorithm to learn robust policies in order to bridge the gap between simulation training and real-world implementation. Our algorithm is based on recently discovered distributional RL framework.

"The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem has reemerged as an important theoretical benchmark for reinforcement learning-based control of complex dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. In contrast with nearly all recent work in this area, we consider multiplicative noise models, which are increasingly relevant because they explicitly incorporate inherent uncertainty and variation in the system dynamics and thereby improve robustness properties of the controller. Robustness is a critical and poorly understood issue in reinforcement learning; existing methods which do not account for uncertainty can converge to fragile policies or fail to converge at all. Additionally, intentional injection of multiplicative noise into learning algorithms can enhance robustness of policies, as observed in ad hoc work on domain randomization. Although policy gradient algorithms require optimization of a non-convex cost function, we show that the multiplicative noise LQR cost has a special property called gradient domination, which is exploited to prove global convergence of policy gradient algorithms to the globally optimum control policy with polynomial dependence on problem parameters. Results are provided both in the model-known and model-unknown settings where samples of system trajectories are used to estimate policy gradients.",0

"Blockchain-enabled Federated Learning (BFL) enables mobile devices to collaboratively train neural network models required by a Machine Learning Model Owner (MLMO) while keeping data on the mobile devices. Then, the model updates are stored in the blockchain in a decentralized and reliable manner. However, the issue of BFL is that the mobile devices have energy and CPU constraints that may reduce the system lifetime and training efficiency. The other issue is that the training latency may increase due to the blockchain mining process. To address these issues, the MLMO needs to (i) decide how much data and energy that the mobile devices use for the training and (ii) determine the block generation rate to minimize the system latency, energy consumption, and incentive cost while achieving the target accuracy for the model. Under the uncertainty of the BFL environment, it is challenging for the MLMO to determine the optimal decisions.

"Meta-learning algorithms use past experience to learn to quickly solve new tasks. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms acquire reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more efficiently by utilizing experience from prior tasks. The performance of meta-learning algorithms depends on the tasks available for meta-training: in the same way that supervised learning generalizes best to test points drawn from the same distribution as the training points, meta-learning methods generalize best to tasks from the same distribution as the meta-training tasks. In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from algorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process of task design as well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated. In this work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We motivate and describe a general recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and present an instantiation of this approach. Our conceptual and theoretical contributions consist of formulating the unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning problem and describing how task proposals based on mutual information can be used to train optimal meta-learners. Our experimental results indicate that unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning effectively acquires accelerated reinforcement learning procedures without the need for manual task design and these procedures exceed the performance of learning from scratch.",0

As a self-imitate approach, ESPD enables a target policy to learn from a series of its stochastic variants through the technique of policy distillation (PD). The learning mechanism of ESPD can be considered as an Evolution Strategy (ES) that applies perturbations upon policy directly on the action space, with a SELECT function to check the superiority of stochastic variants and then use PD to update the policy. The experiments based on the MuJoCo robotics control suite show the high learning efficiency of the proposed method.",0

"Learning a good representation is an essential component for deep reinforcement learning (RL). Representation learning is especially important in multitask and partially observable settings where building a representation of the unknown environment is crucial to solve the tasks. Here we introduce Prediction of Bootstrap Latents (PBL), a simple and flexible self-supervised representation learning algorithm for multitask deep RL. PBL builds on multistep predictive representations of future observations, and focuses on capturing structured information about environment dynamics. Specifically, PBL trains its representation by predicting latent embeddings of future observations. These latent embeddings are themselves trained to be predictive of the aforementioned representations. These predictions form a bootstrapping effect, allowing the agent to learn more about the key aspects of the environment dynamics. In addition, by defining prediction tasks completely in latent space, PBL provides the flexibility of using multimodal observations involving pixel images, language instructions, rewards and more. We show in our experiments that PBL delivers across-the-board improved performance over state of the art deep RL agents in the DMLab-30 and Atari-57 multitask setting.",0

"In the last decade convolutional neural networks have become gargantuan. Pre-trained models, when used as initializers are able to fine-tune ever larger networks on small datasets. Consequently, not all the convolutional features that these fine-tuned models detect are requisite for the end-task. Several works of channel pruning have been proposed to prune away compute and memory from models that were trained already. Typically, these involve policies that decide which and how many channels to remove from each layer leading to channel-wise and/or layer-wise pruning profiles, respectively. In this paper, we conduct several baseline experiments and establish that profiles from random channel-wise pruning policies are as good as metric-based ones. We also establish that there may exist profiles from some layer-wise pruning policies that are measurably better than common baselines. We then demonstrate that the top layer-wise pruning profiles found using an exhaustive random search from one datatset are also among the top profiles for other datasets. This implies that we could identify out-of-the-box layer-wise pruning profiles using benchmark datasets and use these directly for new datasets. Furthermore, we develop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy-based search algorithm with a direct objective of finding transferable layer-wise pruning profiles using many models for the same architecture. We use a novel reward formulation that drives this RL search towards an expected compression while maximizing accuracy. Our results show that our transferred RL-based profiles are as good or better than best profiles found on the original dataset via exhaustive search. We then demonstrate that if we found the profiles using a mid-sized dataset such as Cifar10/100, we are able to transfer them to even a large dataset such as Imagenet.",0

"Robot control problems are often structured with a policy function that maps state values into control values, but in many dynamic problems the observed state can have a difficult to characterize relationship with useful policy actions. In this paper we present a new method for learning state embeddings from plans or other forms of demonstrations such that the embedding space has a specified geometric relationship with the demonstrations. We present a novel variational framework for learning these embeddings that attempts to optimize trajectory linearity in the learned embedding space. We show how these embedding spaces can then be used as an augmentation to the robot state in reinforcement learning problems. We use kinodynamic planning to generate training trajectories for some example environments, and then train embedding spaces for these environments. We show empirically that observing a system in the learned embedding space improves the performance of policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly by reducing the variance between training runs. Our technique is limited to environments where demonstration data is available, but places no limits on how that data is collected. Our embedding technique provides a way to transfer domain knowledge from existing technologies such as planning and control algorithms, into more flexible policy learning algorithms, by creating an abstract representation of the robot state with meaningful geometry.",0

"While most approaches to the problem of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) focus on estimating a reward function that best explains an expert agent's policy or demonstrated behavior on a control task, it is often the case that such behavior is more succinctly represented by a simple reward combined with a set of hard constraints. In this setting, the agent is attempting to maximize cumulative rewards subject to these given constraints on their behavior. We reformulate the problem of IRL on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) such that, given a nominal model of the environment and a nominal reward function, we seek to estimate state, action, and feature constraints in the environment that motivate an agent's behavior. Our approach is based on the Maximum Entropy IRL framework, which allows us to reason about the likelihood of an expert agent's demonstrations given our knowledge of an MDP. Using our method, we can infer which constraints can be added to the MDP to most increase the likelihood of observing these demonstrations. We present an algorithm which iteratively infers the Maximum Likelihood Constraint to best explain observed behavior, and we evaluate its efficacy using both simulated behavior and recorded data of humans navigating around an obstacle.",0

"Embodied artificial intelligence (AI) tasks shift from tasks focusing on internet images to active settings involving embodied agents that perceive and act within 3D environments. In this paper, we investigate the target-driven visual navigation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in 3D indoor scenes, whose navigation task aims to train an agent that can intelligently make a series of decisions to arrive at a pre-specified target location from any possible starting positions only based on egocentric views. However, most navigation methods currently struggle against several challenging problems, such as data efficiency, automatic obstacle avoidance, and generalization. Generalization problem means that agent does not have the ability to transfer navigation skills learned from previous experience to unseen targets and scenes. To address these issues, we incorporate two designs into classic DRL framework: attention on 3D knowledge graph (KG) and target skill extension (TSE) module. On the one hand, our proposed method combines visual features and 3D spatial representations to learn navigation policy. On the other hand, TSE module is used to generate sub-targets which allow agent to learn from failures. Specifically, our 3D spatial relationships are encoded through recently popular graph convolutional network (GCN). Considering the real world settings, our work also considers open action and adds actionable targets into conventional navigation situations. Those more difficult settings are applied to test whether DRL agent really understand its task, navigating environment, and can carry out reasoning.

Moreover, we introduce a novel contribution of computing a soft planner policy and further updating a model-free policy yielding a less computationally expensive model-free agent as good as the model-based one. This model-based architecture serves as a foundation that can be extended to other human-computer interactive tasks allowing further advances in this direction.",0

Additionally, we introduce a novel feature that involves computing a soft planner policy and updating a model-free policy, resulting in a less computationally expensive model-free agent that performs as well as the model-based one. This model-based framework can be extended to other human-computer interactive tasks, paving the way for further advancements in this area.",1
"The purpose of this paper is to outline a generalised model for representing hybrids of relational-categorical, symbolic, perceptual-sensory and perceptual-latent data, so as to embody, in the same architectural data layer, representations for the input, output and latent tensors. This variety of representation is currently used by various machine-learning models in computer vision, NLP/NLU, reinforcement learning which allows for direct application of cross-domain queries and functions. This is achieved by endowing a directed Tensor-Typed Multi-Graph with at least some edge attributes which represent the embeddings from various latent spaces, so as to define, construct and compute new similarity and distance relationships between and across tensorial forms, including visual, linguistic, auditory latent representations, thus stitching the logical-categorical view of the observed universe to the Bayesian/statistical view.",0

"Standard gradient descent methods are susceptible to a range of issues that can impede training, such as high correlations and different scaling in parameter space.These difficulties can be addressed by second-order approaches that apply a pre-conditioning matrix to the gradient to improve convergence. Unfortunately, such algorithms typically struggle to scale to high-dimensional problems, in part because the calculation of specific preconditioners such as the inverse Hessian or Fisher information matrix is highly expensive. We introduce first-order preconditioning (FOP), a fast, scalable approach that generalizes previous work on hypergradient descent (Almeida et al., 1998; Maclaurin et al., 2015; Baydin et al.,2017) to learn a preconditioning matrix that only makes use of first-order information. Experiments show that FOP is able to improve the performance of standard deep learning optimizers on visual classification and reinforcement learning tasks with minimal computational overhead. We also investigate the properties of the learned preconditioning matrices and perform a preliminary theoretical analysis of the algorithm.",0

"The success of reinforcement learning for real world robotics has been, in many cases limited to instrumented laboratory scenarios, often requiring arduous human effort and oversight to enable continuous learning. In this work, we discuss the elements that are needed for a robotic learning system that can continually and autonomously improve with data collected in the real world. We propose a particular instantiation of such a system, using dexterous manipulation as our case study. Subsequently, we investigate a number of challenges that come up when learning without instrumentation. In such settings, learning must be feasible without manually designed resets, using only on-board perception, and without hand-engineered reward functions. We propose simple and scalable solutions to these challenges, and then demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system on a set of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks, providing an in-depth analysis of the challenges associated with this learning paradigm. We demonstrate that our complete system can learn without any human intervention, acquiring a variety of vision-based skills with a real-world three-fingered hand.

"We study reinforcement learning in settings where sampling an action from the policy must be done concurrently with the time evolution of the controlled system, such as when a robot must decide on the next action while still performing the previous action. Much like a person or an animal, the robot must think and move at the same time, deciding on its next action before the previous one has completed. In order to develop an algorithmic framework for such concurrent control problems, we start with a continuous-time formulation of the Bellman equations, and then discretize them in a way that is aware of system delays. We instantiate this new class of approximate dynamic programming methods via a simple architectural extension to existing value-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We evaluate our methods on simulated benchmark tasks and a large-scale robotic grasping task where the robot must ""think while moving"".",0
"Our focus is on studying reinforcement learning in situations where there is a need to concurrently sample an action from the policy and experience the time evolution of the controlled system. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where a robot must determine its next action while still performing the previous one, similar to how humans or animals think and move simultaneously. To address this, we begin by formulating the Bellman equations as a continuous-time model and then discretize it while accounting for system delays.

"In many applications, it is desirable to extract only the relevant information from complex input data, which involves making a decision about which input features are relevant. The information bottleneck method formalizes this as an information-theoretic optimization problem by maintaining an optimal tradeoff between compression (throwing away irrelevant input information), and predicting the target. In many problem settings, including the reinforcement learning problems we consider in this work, we might prefer to compress only part of the input. This is typically the case when we have a standard conditioning input, such as a state observation, and a ""privileged"" input, which might correspond to the goal of a task, the output of a costly planning algorithm, or communication with another agent. In such cases, we might prefer to compress the privileged input, either to achieve better generalization (e.g., with respect to goals) or to minimize access to costly information (e.g., in the case of communication). Practical implementations of the information bottleneck based on variational inference require access to the privileged input in order to compute the bottleneck variable, so although they perform compression, this compression operation itself needs unrestricted, lossless access. In this work, we propose the variational bandwidth bottleneck, which decides for each example on the estimated value of the privileged information before seeing it, i.e., only based on the standard input, and then accordingly chooses stochastically, whether to access the privileged input or not. We formulate a tractable approximation to this framework and demonstrate in a series of reinforcement learning experiments that it can improve generalization and reduce access to computationally costly information.",0
"The extraction of relevant information from intricate input data is often necessary in various applications, requiring the determination of which input features are pertinent. The information bottleneck approach addresses this by optimizing compression, which involves discarding irrelevant input information, and predicting the target, while maintaining an optimal balance between the two. However, in certain scenarios, such as in reinforcement learning problems, it may be preferable to compress only part of the input, specifically the ""privileged"" input, which pertains to the task's goal, output from a costly planning algorithm, or communication with another agent. This can improve generalization with respect to goals or minimize access to expensive information. While variational inference-based implementations of the information bottleneck perform compression, they require unrestricted, lossless access to the privileged input to compute the bottleneck variable. To address this, we propose the variational bandwidth bottleneck, which estimates the value of the privileged information based solely on the standard input and chooses whether to access it stochastically. We provide a feasible approximation to this approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing generalization and reducing access to costly information in a range of reinforcement learning experiments.",1
"As a subfield of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) aims at empowering one's capabilities in behavioural decision making by using interaction experience with the world and an evaluative feedback. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that usually rely on one-shot, exhaustive and supervised reward signals, RL tackles with sequential decision making problems with sampled, evaluative and delayed feedback simultaneously. Such distinctive features make RL technique a suitable candidate for developing powerful solutions in a variety of healthcare domains, where diagnosing decisions or treatment regimes are usually characterized by a prolonged and sequential procedure.

"We investigate the evolution of the Q values for the implementation of Deep Q Learning (DQL) in the Stable Baselines library. Stable Baselines incorporates the latest Reinforcement Learning techniques and achieves superhuman performance in many game environments. However, for some simple non-game environments, the DQL in Stable Baselines can struggle to find the correct actions. In this paper we aim to understand the types of environment where this suboptimal behavior can happen, and also investigate the corresponding evolution of the Q values for individual states.   We compare a smart TrafficLight environment (where performance is poor) with the AI Gym FrozenLake environment (where performance is perfect). We observe that DQL struggles with TrafficLight because actions are reversible and hence the Q values in a given state are closer than in FrozenLake. We then investigate the evolution of the Q values using a recent decomposition technique of Achiam et al..

"Model quantization is a widely used technique to compress and accelerate deep neural network (DNN) inference, especially when deploying to edge or IoT devices with limited computation capacity and power consumption budget. The uniform bit width quantization across all the layers is usually sub-optimal and the exploration of hybrid quantization for different layers is vital for efficient deep compression. In this paper, we employ the meta learning method to automatically realize low-bit hybrid quantization of neural networks. A MetaQuantNet, together with a Quantization function, are trained to generate the quantized weights for the target DNN. Then, we apply a genetic algorithm to search the best hybrid quantization policy that meets compression constraints. With the best searched quantization policy, we subsequently retrain or finetune to further improve the performance of the quantized target network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of searched hybrid quantization scheme surpass that of uniform bitwidth counterpart. Compared to the existing reinforcement learning (RL) based hybrid quantization search approach that relies on tedious explorations, our meta learning approach is more efficient and effective for any compression requirements since the MetaQuantNet only needs be trained once.",0

"This paper considers multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in networked system control. Specifically, each agent learns a decentralized control policy based on local observations and messages from connected neighbors. We formulate such a networked MARL (NMARL) problem as a spatiotemporal Markov decision process and introduce a spatial discount factor to stabilize the training of each local agent. Further, we propose a new differentiable communication protocol, called NeurComm, to reduce information loss and non-stationarity in NMARL. Based on experiments in realistic NMARL scenarios of adaptive traffic signal control and cooperative adaptive cruise control, an appropriate spatial discount factor effectively enhances the learning curves of non-communicative MARL algorithms, while NeurComm outperforms existing communication protocols in both learning efficiency and control performance.",0

"This paper presents a new neural architecture that combines a modulated Hebbian network (MOHN) with DQN, which we call modulated Hebbian plus Q network architecture (MOHQA). The hypothesis is that such a combination allows MOHQA to solve difficult partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problems which impair temporal difference (TD)-based RL algorithms such as DQN, as the TD error cannot be easily derived from observations. The key idea is to use a Hebbian network with bio-inspired neural traces in order to bridge temporal delays between actions and rewards when confounding observations and sparse rewards result in inaccurate TD errors. In MOHQA, DQN learns low level features and control, while the MOHN contributes to the high-level decisions by associating rewards with past states and actions. Thus the proposed architecture combines two modules with significantly different learning algorithms, a Hebbian associative network and a classical DQN pipeline, exploiting the advantages of both. Simulations on a set of POMDPs and on the MALMO environment show that the proposed algorithm improved DQN's results and even outperformed control tests with A2C, QRDQN+LSTM and REINFORCE algorithms on some POMDPs with confounding stimuli and sparse rewards.",0

The MOHN with bio-inspired neural traces functions as a Hebbian network to connect temporal delays between actions and rewards, while DQN focuses on low-level features and control. By uniting these two modules, MOHQA takes advantage of both learning algorithms and produces better results than A2C, QRDQN+LSTM, and REINFORCE algorithms on some POMDPs with confounding stimuli and sparse rewards according to simulations on a variety of POMDPs and the MALMO setting.",1
"Standard planners for sequential decision making (including Monte Carlo planning, tree search, dynamic programming, etc.) are constrained by an implicit sequential planning assumption: The order in which a plan is constructed is the same in which it is executed. We consider alternatives to this assumption for the class of goal-directed Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. Instead of an environment transition model, we assume an imperfect, goal-directed policy. This low-level policy can be improved by a plan, consisting of an appropriate sequence of sub-goals that guide it from the start to the goal state. We propose a planning algorithm, Divide-and-Conquer Monte Carlo Tree Search (DC-MCTS), for approximating the optimal plan by means of proposing intermediate sub-goals which hierarchically partition the initial tasks into simpler ones that are then solved independently and recursively. The algorithm critically makes use of a learned sub-goal proposal for finding appropriate partitions trees of new tasks based on prior experience. Different strategies for learning sub-goal proposals give rise to different planning strategies that strictly generalize sequential planning. We show that this algorithmic flexibility over planning order leads to improved results in navigation tasks in grid-worlds as well as in challenging continuous control environments.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms frequently require prohibitive interaction experience to ensure the quality of learned policies. The limitation is partly because the agent cannot learn much from the many low-quality trials in early learning phase, which results in low learning rate. Focusing on addressing this limitation, this paper makes a twofold contribution. First, we develop an algorithm, called Experience Grafting (EG), to enable RL agents to reorganize segments of the few high-quality trajectories from the experience pool to generate many synthetic trajectories while retaining the quality. Second, building on EG, we further develop an AutoEG agent that automatically learns to adjust the grafting-based learning strategy. Results collected from a set of six robotic control environments show that, in comparison to a standard deep RL algorithm (DDPG), AutoEG increases the speed of learning process by at least 30%.",0

"This paper presents a preliminary study comparing different observation and action space representations for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the context of Real-time Strategy (RTS) games. Specifically, we compare two representations: (1) a global representation where the observation represents the whole game state, and the RL agent needs to choose which unit to issue actions to, and which actions to execute; and (2) a local representation where the observation is represented from the point of view of an individual unit, and the RL agent picks actions for each unit independently. We evaluate these representations in $\mu$RTS showing that the local representation seems to outperform the global representation when training agents with the task of harvesting resources.",0

"In this work, we present a learning-based approach to chip placement, one of the most complex and time-consuming stages of the chip design process. Unlike prior methods, our approach has the ability to learn from past experience and improve over time. In particular, as we train over a greater number of chip blocks, our method becomes better at rapidly generating optimized placements for previously unseen chip blocks. To achieve these results, we pose placement as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem and train an agent to place the nodes of a chip netlist onto a chip canvas. To enable our RL policy to generalize to unseen blocks, we ground representation learning in the supervised task of predicting placement quality. By designing a neural architecture that can accurately predict reward across a wide variety of netlists and their placements, we are able to generate rich feature embeddings of the input netlists. We then use this architecture as the encoder of our policy and value networks to enable transfer learning. Our objective is to minimize PPA (power, performance, and area), and we show that, in under 6 hours, our method can generate placements that are superhuman or comparable on modern accelerator netlists, whereas existing baselines require human experts in the loop and take several weeks.",0

"One of the most interesting application scenarios in anomaly detection is when sequential data are targeted. For example, in a safety-critical environment, it is crucial to have an automatic detection system to screen the streaming data gathered by monitoring sensors and to report abnormal observations if detected in real-time. Oftentimes, stakes are much higher when these potential anomalies are intentional or goal-oriented. We propose an end-to-end framework for sequential anomaly detection using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), whose objective is to determine the decision-making agent's underlying function which triggers his/her behavior. The proposed method takes the sequence of actions of a target agent (and possibly other meta information) as input. The agent's normal behavior is then understood by the reward function which is inferred via IRL. We use a neural network to represent a reward function. Using a learned reward function, we evaluate whether a new observation from the target agent follows a normal pattern. In order to construct a reliable anomaly detection method and take into consideration the confidence of the predicted anomaly score, we adopt a Bayesian approach for IRL. The empirical study on publicly available real-world data shows that our proposed method is effective in identifying anomalies.",0

"Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) is frequently used to formally specify control objectives such as probabilistic reachability and safety. In this work, we focus on model checking PCTL specifications statistically on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by sampling, e.g., checking whether there exists a feasible policy such that the probability of reaching certain goal states is greater than a threshold. We use reinforcement learning to search for such a feasible policy for PCTL specifications, and then develop a statistical model checking (SMC) method with provable guarantees on its error. Specifically, we first use upper-confidence-bound (UCB) based Q-learning to design an SMC algorithm for bounded-time PCTL specifications, and then extend this algorithm to unbounded-time specifications by identifying a proper truncation time by checking the PCTL specification and its negation at the same time. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on case studies.",0

"Multi-simulator training has contributed to the recent success of Deep Reinforcement Learning by stabilizing learning and allowing for higher training throughputs.

We prove that GALA agents remain within an epsilon-ball of one-another during training when using loosely coupled asynchronous communication. By reducing the amount of synchronization between agents, GALA is more computationally efficient and scalable compared to A2C, its fully-synchronous counterpart. GALA also outperforms A2C, being more robust and sample efficient.

"This paper investigates to what extent one can improve reinforcement learning algorithms. Our study is split in three parts. First, our analysis shows that the classical asymptotic convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ is pessimistic and can be replaced by $O((\log(N)/N)^{\beta})$ with $\frac{1}{2}\leq \beta \leq 1$ and $N$ the number of iterations. Second, we propose a dynamic optimal policy for the choice of the learning rate $(\gamma_k)_{k\geq 0}$ used in stochastic approximation (SA). We decompose our policy into two interacting levels: the inner and the outer level. In the inner level, we present the \nameref{Alg:v_4_s} algorithm (for ""PAst Sign Search"") which, based on a predefined sequence $(\gamma^o_k)_{k\geq 0}$, constructs a new sequence $(\gamma^i_k)_{k\geq 0}$ whose error decreases faster. In the outer level, we propose an optimal methodology for the selection of the predefined sequence $(\gamma^o_k)_{k\geq 0}$. Third, we show empirically that our selection methodology of the learning rate outperforms significantly standard algorithms used in reinforcement learning (RL) in the three following applications: the estimation of a drift, the optimal placement of limit orders and the optimal execution of large number of shares.",0

However, in real world settings, the environment is often non-stationary and subject to unpredictable, frequent changes. In this paper we propose and openly release CRLMaze, a new benchmark for learning continually through reinforcement in a complex 3D non-stationary task based on ViZDoom and subject to several environmental changes. Then, we introduce an end-to-end model-free continual reinforcement learning strategy showing competitive results with respect to four different baselines and not requiring any access to additional supervised signals, previously encountered environmental conditions or observations.",0

"Path planning methods for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in goods delivery have drawn great attention from industry and academics because of its flexibility which is suitable for many situations in the ""Last Kilometer"" between customer and delivery nodes. However, the complicated situation is still a problem for traditional combinatorial optimization methods. Based on the state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL), this paper proposed an improved method to achieve path planning for UAVs in complex surroundings: multiple no-fly zones. The improved approach leverages the attention mechanism and includes the embedding mechanism as the encoder and three different widths of beam search (i.e.,~1, 5, and 10) as the decoders. Policy gradients are utilized to train the RL model for obtaining the optimal strategies during inference. The results show the feasibility and efficiency of the model applying in this kind of complicated situation. Comparing the model with the results obtained by the optimization solver OR-tools, it improves the reliability of the distribution system and has a guiding significance for the broad application of UAVs.",0

"Surveillance camera networks are a useful infrastructure for various visual analytics applications, where high-level inferences and predictions could be made based on target tracking across the network. Most multi-camera tracking works focus on target re-identification and trajectory association problems to track the target. However, since camera networks can generate enormous amount of video data, inefficient schemes for making re-identification or trajectory association queries can incur prohibitively large computational requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of intelligent scheduling of re-identification queries in a multi-camera tracking setting. To this end, we formulate the target tracking problem in a camera network as an MDP and learn a reinforcement learning based policy that selects a camera for making a re-identification query. The proposed approach to camera selection does not assume the knowledge of the camera network topology but the resulting policy implicitly learns it. We have also shown that such a policy can be learnt directly from data. Using the NLPR MCT and the Duke MTMC multi-camera multi-target tracking benchmarks, we empirically show that the proposed approach substantially reduces the number of frames queried.",0

"While high resolution images contain semantically more useful information than their lower resolution counterparts, processing them is computationally more expensive, and in some applications, e.g. remote sensing, they can be much more expensive to acquire. For these reasons, it is desirable to develop an automatic method to selectively use high resolution data when necessary while maintaining accuracy and reducing acquisition/run-time cost. In this direction, we propose PatchDrop a reinforcement learning approach to dynamically identify when and where to use/acquire high resolution data conditioned on the paired, cheap, low resolution images. We conduct experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet and fMoW datasets where we use significantly less high resolution data while maintaining similar accuracy to models which use full high resolution images.",0

"A significant challenge in developing AI that can generalize well is designing agents that learn about their world without being told what to learn, and apply that learning to challenges with sparse rewards. Moreover, most traditional reinforcement learning approaches explicitly separate learning and decision making in a way that does not correspond to biological learning. We implement an architecture founded in principles of experimental neuroscience, by combining computationally efficient abstractions of biological algorithms. Our approach is inspired by research on spike-timing dependent plasticity, the transition between short and long term memory, and the role of various neurotransmitters in rewarding curiosity. The Neurons-in-a-Box architecture can learn in a wholly generalizable manner, and demonstrates an efficient way to build and apply representations without explicitly optimizing over a set of criteria or actions. We find it performs well in many environments including OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car, which has no reward besides touching a hard-to-reach flag on a hill, Inverted Pendulum, where it learns simple strategies to improve the time it holds a pendulum up, a video stream, where it spontaneously learns to distinguish an open and closed hand, as well as other environments like Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game.",0

"Recent works in high-dimensional model-predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning with learned dynamics and reward models have resorted to population-based optimization methods, such as the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), for planning a sequence of actions. To decide on an action to take, CEM conducts a search for the action sequence with the highest return according to the dynamics model and reward. Action sequences are typically randomly sampled from an unconditional Gaussian distribution and evaluated on the environment. This distribution is iteratively updated towards action sequences with higher returns. However, this planning method can be very inefficient, especially for high-dimensional action spaces. An alternative line of approaches optimize action sequences directly via gradient descent, but are prone to local optima. We propose a method to solve this planning problem by interleaving CEM and gradient descent steps in optimizing the action sequence. Our experiments show faster convergence of the proposed hybrid approach, even for high-dimensional action spaces, avoidance of local minima, and better or equal performance to CEM.

"Although recent model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to be capable of mastering complicated decision-making tasks, the sample complexity of these methods has remained a hurdle to utilizing them in many real-world applications. In this regard, model-based reinforcement learning proposes some remedies. Yet, inherently, model-based methods are more computationally expensive and susceptible to sub-optimality. One reason is that model-generated data are always less accurate than real data, and this often leads to inaccurate transition and reward function models. With the aim to mitigate this problem, this work presents the notion of survival by discussing cases in which the agent's goal is to survive and its analogy to maximizing the expected rewards. To that end, a substitute model for the reward function approximator is introduced that learns to avoid terminal states rather than to maximize accumulated rewards from safe states. Focusing on terminal states, as a small fraction of state-space, reduces the training effort drastically. Next, a model-based reinforcement learning method is proposed (Survive) to train an agent to avoid dangerous states through a safety map model built upon temporal credit assignment in the vicinity of terminal states. Finally, the performance of the presented algorithm is investigated, along with a comparison between the proposed and current methods.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) allows to solve complex tasks such as Go often with a stronger performance than humans. However, the learned behaviors are usually fixed to specific tasks and unable to adapt to different contexts. Here we consider the case of adapting RL agents to different time restrictions, such as finishing a task with a given time limit that might change from one task execution to the next. We define such problems as Time Adaptive Markov Decision Processes and introduce two model-free, value-based algorithms: the Independent Gamma-Ensemble and the n-Step Ensemble.

"In this paper, we formulate the adaptive learning problem---the problem of how to find an individualized learning plan (called policy) that chooses the most appropriate learning materials based on learner's latent traits---faced in adaptive learning systems as a Markov decision process (MDP). We assume latent traits to be continuous with an unknown transition model. We apply a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm---the deep Q-learning algorithm---that can effectively find the optimal learning policy from data on learners' learning process without knowing the actual transition model of the learners' continuous latent traits. To efficiently utilize available data, we also develop a transition model estimator that emulates the learner's learning process using neural networks. The transition model estimator can be used in the deep Q-learning algorithm so that it can more efficiently discover the optimal learning policy for a learner. Numerical simulation studies verify that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in finding a good learning policy, especially with the aid of a transition model estimator, it can find the optimal learning policy after training using a small number of learners.",0

This estimator can be integrated into the deep Q-learning algorithm to enhance its ability to identify the optimal learning policy. Our simulations demonstrate that this algorithm is effective in identifying a good learning policy, and that it can quickly identify the optimal policy with a small number of learners when used in conjunction with the transition model estimator.",1
"We propose a novel approach to learn goal-conditioned policies for locomotion in a batch RL setting. The batch data is collected by a policy that is not goal-conditioned. For the locomotion task, this translates to data collection using a policy learnt by the agent for walking straight in one direction, and using that data to learn a goal-conditioned policy that enables the agent to walk in any direction. The data collection policy used should be invariant to the direction the agent is facing i.e. regardless of its initial orientation, the agent should take the same actions to walk forward. We exploit this property to learn a goal-conditioned policy using two key ideas: (1) augmenting data by generating trajectories with the same actions in different directions, and (2) learning an encoder that enforces invariance between these rotated trajectories with a Siamese framework. We show that our approach outperforms existing RL algorithms on 3-D locomotion agents like Ant, Humanoid and Minitaur.",0
"In this study, we present an innovative method for acquiring goal-conditioned policies for locomotion in a batch RL environment.

To achieve locomotion, we utilize the data collected by an agent trained to walk straight in one direction and use it to teach a goal-conditioned policy that allows the agent to move in any direction. The data collection strategy should be unaffected by the agent's orientation, meaning that the agent should perform the same actions to move forward, regardless of its starting position. We make use of this characteristic to develop a goal-conditioned policy by (1) expanding data by producing trajectories with identical actions in varying directions, and (2) teaching an encoder that enforces consistency between these rotated trajectories using a Siamese framework. We demonstrate that our technique outperforms existing RL algorithms on 3-D locomotion agents such as Ant, Humanoid, and Minitaur.",1
"Traditional centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are sometimes unpractical in complicated applications, due to non-interactivity between agents, curse of dimensionality and computation complexity. Hence, several decentralized MARL algorithms are motivated. However, existing decentralized methods only handle the fully cooperative setting where massive information needs to be transmitted in training. The block coordinate gradient descent scheme they used for successive independent actor and critic steps can simplify the calculation, but it causes serious bias. In this paper, we propose a flexible fully decentralized actor-critic MARL framework, which can combine most of actor-critic methods, and handle large-scale general cooperative multi-agent setting. A primal-dual hybrid gradient descent type algorithm framework is designed to learn individual agents separately for decentralization. From the perspective of each agent, policy improvement and value evaluation are jointly optimized, which can stabilize multi-agent policy learning. Furthermore, our framework can achieve scalability and stability for large-scale environment and reduce information transmission, by the parameter sharing mechanism and a novel modeling-other-agents methods based on theory-of-mind and online supervised learning. Sufficient experiments in cooperative Multi-agent Particle Environment and StarCraft II show that our decentralized MARL instantiation algorithms perform competitively against conventional centralized and decentralized methods.",0

"Predictive auxiliary tasks have been shown to improve performance in numerous reinforcement learning works, however, this effect is still not well understood. The primary purpose of the work presented here is to investigate the impact that an auxiliary task's prediction timescale has on the agent's policy performance. We consider auxiliary tasks which learn to make on-policy predictions using temporal difference learning. We test the impact of prediction timescale using a specific form of auxiliary task in which the input image is used as the prediction target, which we refer to as temporal difference autoencoders (TD-AE). We empirically evaluate the effect of TD-AE on the A2C algorithm in the VizDoom environment using different prediction timescales. While we do not observe a clear relationship between the prediction timescale on performance, we make the following observations: 1) using auxiliary tasks allows us to reduce the trajectory length of the A2C algorithm, 2) in some cases temporally extended TD-AE performs better than a straight autoencoder, 3) performance with auxiliary tasks is sensitive to the weight placed on the auxiliary loss, 4) despite this sensitivity, auxiliary tasks improved performance without extensive hyper-parameter tuning. Our overall conclusions are that TD-AE increases the robustness of the A2C algorithm to the trajectory length and while promising, further study is required to fully understand the relationship between auxiliary task prediction timescale and the agent's performance.",0

"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically require massive amount of computation resource in inference tasks for computer vision applications. Quantization can significantly reduce DNN computation and storage by decreasing the bitwidth of network encodings. Recent research affirms that carefully selecting the quantization levels for each layer can preserve the accuracy while pushing the bitwidth below eight bits. However, without arduous manual effort, this deep quantization can lead to significant accuracy loss, leaving it in a position of questionable utility. As such, deep quantization opens a large hyper-parameter space (bitwidth of the layers), the exploration of which is a major challenge. We propose a systematic approach to tackle this problem, by automating the process of discovering the quantization levels through an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework (ReLeQ). We adapt policy optimization methods to the problem of quantization, and focus on finding the best design decisions in choosing the state and action spaces, network architecture and training framework, as well as the tuning of various hyperparamters. We show how ReLeQ can balance speed and quality, and provide an asymmetric general solution for quantization of a large variety of deep networks (AlexNet, CIFAR-10, LeNet, MobileNet-V1, ResNet-20, SVHN, and VGG-11) that virtually preserves the accuracy (=< 0.3% loss) while minimizing the computation and storage cost. With these DNNs, ReLeQ enables conventional hardware to achieve 2.2x speedup over 8-bit execution. Similarly, a custom DNN accelerator achieves 2.0x speedup and energy reduction compared to 8-bit runs. These encouraging results mark ReLeQ as the initial step towards automating the deep quantization of neural networks.",0

"In this paper, the main task we aim to tackle is the multi-instance semi-supervised video object segmentation across a sequence of frames where only the first-frame box-level ground-truth is provided. Detection-based algorithms are widely adopted to handle this task, and the challenges lie in the selection of the matching method to predict the result as well as to decide whether to update the target template using the newly predicted result. The existing methods, however, make these selections in a rough and inflexible way, compromising their performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach which utilizes reinforcement learning to make these two decisions at the same time. Specifically, the reinforcement learning agent learns to decide whether to update the target template according to the quality of the predicted result. The choice of the matching method will be determined at the same time, based on the action history of the reinforcement learning agent. Experiments show that our method is almost 10 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art method with even higher accuracy (region similarity of 69.1% on DAVIS 2017 dataset).",0

The basic MTR buffer comprises a cascade of sub-buffers that accumulate experiences at different timescales, enabling the agent to improve the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of old knowledge. We also combine the MTR framework with invariant risk minimization, with the idea of encouraging the agent to learn a policy that is robust across the various environments it encounters over time. The MTR methods are evaluated in three different continual learning settings on two continuous control tasks and, in many cases, show improvement over the baselines.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been demonstrated to have great potential in many applications of scientific discovery and design. Recent work includes, for example, the design of new structures and compositions of molecules for therapeutic drugs. Much of the existing work related to the application of RL to scientific domains, however, assumes that the available state representation obeys the Markov property. For reasons associated with time, cost, sensor accuracy, and gaps in scientific knowledge, many scientific design and discovery problems do not satisfy the Markov property. Thus, something other than a Markov decision process (MDP) should be used to plan / find the optimal policy. In this paper, we present a physics-inspired semi-Markov RL environment, namely the phase change environment. In addition, we evaluate the performance of value-based RL algorithms for both MDPs and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) on the proposed environment. Our results demonstrate deep recurrent Q-networks (DRQN) significantly outperform deep Q-networks (DQN), and that DRQNs benefit from training with hindsight experience replay.

"Despite success in many real-world tasks (e.g., robotics), reinforcement learning (RL) agents still learn from tabula rasa when facing new and dynamic scenarios. By contrast, humans can offload this burden through textual descriptions. Although recent works have shown the benefits of instructive texts in goal-conditioned RL, few have studied whether descriptive texts help agents to generalize across dynamic environments. To promote research in this direction, we introduce a new platform, BabyAI++, to generate various dynamic environments along with corresponding descriptive texts. Moreover, we benchmark several baselines inherited from the instruction following setting and develop a novel approach towards visually-grounded language learning on our platform. Extensive experiments show strong evidence that using descriptive texts improves the generalization of RL agents across environments with varied dynamics.",0

"Having access to a forward model enables the use of planning algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Rolling Horizon Evolution. Where a model is unavailable, a natural aim is to learn a model that reflects accurately the dynamics of the environment. In many situations it might not be possible and minimal glitches in the model may lead to poor performance and failure. This paper explores the problem of model misspecification through uncertainty-aware reinforcement learning agents. We propose a bootstrapped multi-headed neural network that learns the distribution of future states and rewards. We experiment with a number of schemes to extract the most likely predictions. Moreover, we also introduce a global error correction filter that applies high-level constraints guided by the context provided through the predictive distribution. We illustrate our approach on Minipacman. The evaluation demonstrates that when dealing with imperfect models, our methods exhibit increased performance and stability, both in terms of model accuracy and in its use within a planning algorithm.",0

"Temporal-difference learning (TD), coupled with neural networks, is among the most fundamental building blocks of deep reinforcement learning. However, due to the nonlinearity in value function approximation, such a coupling leads to nonconvexity and even divergence in optimization. As a result, the global convergence of neural TD remains unclear. In this paper, we prove for the first time that neural TD converges at a sublinear rate to the global optimum of the mean-squared projected Bellman error for policy evaluation. In particular, we show how such global convergence is enabled by the overparametrization of neural networks, which also plays a vital role in the empirical success of neural TD. Beyond policy evaluation, we establish the global convergence of neural (soft) Q-learning, which is further connected to that of policy gradient algorithms.",0

"Advances in deep neural networks (DNN) greatly bolster real-time detection of anomalous IoT data. However, IoT devices can hardly afford complex DNN models, and offloading anomaly detection tasks to the cloud incurs long delay. In this paper, we propose and build a demo for an adaptive anomaly detection approach for distributed hierarchical edge computing (HEC) systems to solve this problem, for both univariate and multivariate IoT data. First, we construct multiple anomaly detection DNN models with increasing complexity, and associate each model with a layer in HEC from bottom to top. Then, we design an adaptive scheme to select one of these models on the fly, based on the contextual information extracted from each input data. The model selection is formulated as a contextual bandit problem characterized by a single-step Markov decision process, and is solved using a reinforcement learning policy network. We build an HEC testbed, implement our proposed approach, and evaluate it using real IoT datasets. The demo shows that our proposed approach significantly reduces detection delay (e.g., by 71.4% for univariate dataset) without sacrificing accuracy, as compared to offloading detection tasks to the cloud. We also compare it with other baseline schemes and demonstrate that it achieves the best accuracy-delay tradeoff. Our demo is also available online: https://rebrand.ly/91a71",0

"In the contemporary big data realm, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are evolving towards more complex architectures to achieve higher inference accuracy. Model compression techniques can be leveraged to efficiently deploy such compute-intensive architectures on resource-limited mobile devices. Such methods comprise various hyper-parameters that require per-layer customization to ensure high accuracy. Choosing such hyper-parameters is cumbersome as the pertinent search space grows exponentially with model layers. This paper introduces GeneCAI, a novel optimization method that automatically learns how to tune per-layer compression hyper-parameters. We devise a bijective translation scheme that encodes compressed DNNs to the genotype space. The optimality of each genotype is measured using a multi-objective score based on accuracy and number of floating point operations. We develop customized genetic operations to iteratively evolve the non-dominated solutions towards the optimal Pareto front, thus, capturing the optimal trade-off between model accuracy and complexity. GeneCAI optimization method is highly scalable and can achieve a near-linear performance boost on distributed multi-GPU platforms. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that GeneCAI outperforms existing rule-based and reinforcement learning methods in DNN compression by finding models that lie on a better accuracy-complexity Pareto curve.",0

Instead of directly learning a meta-policy, we develop a Meta-learner with Subtask Graph Inference(MSGI), which infers the latent parameter of the task by interacting with the environment and maximizes the return given the latent parameter. To facilitate learning, we adopt an intrinsic reward inspired by upper confidence bound (UCB) that encourages efficient exploration.

"Fashion is a complex social phenomenon. People follow fashion styles from demonstrations by experts or fashion icons. However, for machine agent, learning to imitate fashion experts from demonstrations can be challenging, especially for complex styles in environments with high-dimensional, multimodal observations. Most existing research regarding fashion outfit composition utilizes supervised learning methods to mimic the behaviors of style icons. These methods suffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates some given outfit demonstrations, it can drift away from one style to another styles given subtle differences. In this work, we propose an adversarial inverse reinforcement learning formulation to recover reward functions based on hierarchical multimodal representation (HM-AIRL) during the imitation process. The hierarchical joint representation can more comprehensively model the expert composited outfit demonstrations to recover the reward function. We demonstrate that the proposed HM-AIRL model is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in multimodal observations, enabling us to learn policies under significant variation between different styles.",0

"We consider finite and infinite horizon dynamic programming problems, where the control at each stage consists of several distinct decisions, each one made by one of several agents. We introduce an approach, whereby at every stage, each agent's decision is made by executing a local rollout algorithm that uses a base policy, together with some coordinating information from the other agents. The amount of local computation required at every stage by each agent is independent of the number of agents, while the amount of total computation (over all agents) grows linearly with the number of agents. By contrast, with the standard rollout algorithm, the amount of total computation grows exponentially with the number of agents. Despite the drastic reduction in required computation, we show that our algorithm has the fundamental cost improvement property of rollout: an improved performance relative to the base policy. We also discuss possibilities to improve further the method's computational efficiency through limited agent coordination and parallelization of the agents' computations. Finally, we explore related approximate policy iteration algorithms for infinite horizon problems, and we prove that the cost improvement property steers the algorithm towards convergence to an agent-by-agent optimal policy.",0

"With the growing attention on learning-to-learn new tasks using only a few examples, meta-learning has been widely used in numerous problems such as few-shot classification, reinforcement learning, and domain generalization. However, meta-learning models are prone to overfitting when there are no sufficient training tasks for the meta-learners to generalize. Although existing approaches such as Dropout are widely used to address the overfitting problem, these methods are typically designed for regularizing models of a single task in supervised training. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective method to alleviate the risk of overfitting for gradient-based meta-learning. Specifically, during the gradient-based adaptation stage, we randomly drop the gradient in the inner-loop optimization of each parameter in deep neural networks, such that the augmented gradients improve generalization to new tasks. We present a general form of the proposed gradient dropout regularization and show that this term can be sampled from either the Bernoulli or Gaussian distribution. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on numerous computer vision tasks, demonstrating that the gradient dropout regularization mitigates the overfitting problem and improves the performance upon various gradient-based meta-learning frameworks.",0

"In distributed reinforcement learning, it is common to exchange the experience memory of each agent and thereby collectively train their local models. The experience memory, however, contains all the preceding state observations and their corresponding policies of the host agent, which may violate the privacy of the agent. To avoid this problem, in this work, we propose a privacy-preserving distributed reinforcement learning (RL) framework, termed federated reinforcement distillation (FRD). The key idea is to exchange a proxy experience memory comprising a pre-arranged set of states and time-averaged policies, thereby preserving the privacy of actual experiences. Based on an advantage actor-critic RL architecture, we numerically evaluate the effectiveness of FRD and investigate how the performance of FRD is affected by the proxy memory structure and different memory exchanging rules.",0

"Demonstration is an appealing way for humans to provide assistance to reinforcement-learning agents. Most approaches in this area view demonstrations primarily as sources of behavioral bias. But in sparse-reward tasks, humans seem to treat demonstrations more as sources of causal knowledge.

In this framework, agents develop causal models through observation, and reason from this knowledge to decompose tasks for effective reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that a basic implementation of Reasoning from Demonstration (RfD) is effective in a range of sparse-reward tasks.",0

"While deep neural networks (DNNs) and Gaussian Processes (GPs) are both popularly utilized to solve problems in reinforcement learning, both approaches feature undesirable drawbacks for challenging problems. DNNs learn complex nonlinear embeddings, but do not naturally quantify uncertainty and are often data-inefficient to train. GPs infer posterior distributions over functions, but popular kernels exhibit limited expressivity on complex and high-dimensional data. Fortunately, recently discovered conjugate and neural tangent kernel functions encode the behavior of overparameterized neural networks in the kernel domain. We demonstrate that these kernels can be efficiently applied to regression and reinforcement learning problems by analyzing a baseline case study. We apply GPs with neural network dual kernels to solve reinforcement learning tasks for the first time. We demonstrate, using the well-understood mountain-car problem, that GPs empowered with dual kernels perform at least as well as those using the conventional radial basis function kernel.

This paper introduces four significant findings. Firstly, it establishes an alternative policy gradient theorem that utilizes weak derivatives instead of the score function. Secondly, it demonstrates that the stochastic gradient estimates produced by this method are unbiased and lead to algorithms that converge almost certainly to stationary points of the reinforcement learning problem's non-convex value function. Thirdly, the algorithm's sample complexity is calculated to be $O(1/\sqrt(k))$. Lastly, it is shown that the expected gradient estimate variance obtained through the weak derivative approach is lower than that of the commonly used score-function method. The proposed algorithm outperforms previous experiments on the OpenAI gym pendulum environment.",1
"We undertake a precise study of the asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties of stochastic approximation procedures with Polyak-Ruppert averaging for solving a linear system $\bar{A} \theta = \bar{b}$. When the matrix $\bar{A}$ is Hurwitz, we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the averaged iterates with fixed step size and number of iterations going to infinity. The CLT characterizes the exact asymptotic covariance matrix, which is the sum of the classical Polyak-Ruppert covariance and a correction term that scales with the step size. Under assumptions on the tail of the noise distribution, we prove a non-asymptotic concentration inequality whose main term matches the covariance in CLT in any direction, up to universal constants. When the matrix $\bar{A}$ is not Hurwitz but only has non-negative real parts in its eigenvalues, we prove that the averaged LSA procedure actually achieves an $O(1/T)$ rate in mean-squared error. Our results provide a more refined understanding of linear stochastic approximation in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We also show various applications of the main results, including the study of momentum-based stochastic gradient methods as well as temporal difference algorithms in reinforcement learning.",0

"Location is key to spatialize internet-of-things (IoT) data. However, it is challenging to use low-cost IoT devices for robust unsupervised localization (i.e., localization without training data that have known location labels). Thus, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based unsupervised wireless-localization method. The main contributions are as follows. (1) This paper proposes an approach to model a continuous wireless-localization process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and process it within a DRL framework. (2) To alleviate the challenge of obtaining rewards when using unlabeled data (e.g., daily-life crowdsourced data), this paper presents a reward-setting mechanism, which extracts robust landmark data from unlabeled wireless received signal strengths (RSS). (3) To ease requirements for model re-training when using DRL for localization, this paper uses RSS measurements together with agent location to construct DRL inputs. The proposed method was tested by using field testing data from multiple Bluetooth 5 smart ear tags in a pasture. Meanwhile, the experimental verification process reflected the advantages and challenges for using DRL in wireless localization.",0

"The ability to learn in dynamic, nonstationary environments without forgetting previous knowledge, also known as Continual Learning (CL), is a key enabler for scalable and trustworthy deployments of adaptive solutions. While the importance of continual learning is largely acknowledged in machine vision and reinforcement learning problems, this is mostly under-documented for sequence processing tasks. This work proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for CL that is able to deal with concept drift in input distribution without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. We also implement and test a popular CL approach, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), on top of two different types of RNNs. Finally, we compare the performances of our enhanced architecture against EWC and RNNs on a set of standard CL benchmarks, adapted to the sequential data processing scenario.

"In the past few years supervised and adversarial learning have been widely adopted in various complex computer vision tasks. It seems natural to wonder whether another branch of artificial intelligence, commonly known as Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit such complex vision tasks. In this study, we explore the plausible usage of RL in super resolution of remote sensing imagery. Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling. We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free environment from theoretical and empirical perspective. Furthermore, we analyze the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote sensing datasets. Based on our experiments, we report considerable improvement over state-of-the-art methods by encapsulating supervised models in a reinforcement learning framework.",0

"We present for the first time an asymptotic convergence analysis of two time-scale stochastic approximation driven by ""controlled"" Markov noise. In particular, the faster and slower recursions have non-additive controlled Markov noise components in addition to martingale difference noise. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of our framework by relating it to limiting differential inclusions in both time scales that are defined in terms of the ergodic occupation measures associated with the controlled Markov processes. Using a special case of our results, we present a solution to the off-policy convergence problem for temporal-difference learning with linear function approximation. We compile several aspects of the dynamics of stochastic approximation algorithms with Markov iterate-dependent noise when the iterates are not known to be stable beforehand. We achieve the same by extending the lock-in probability (i.e. the probability of convergence to a specific attractor of the limiting o.d.e. given that the iterates are in its domain of attraction after a sufficiently large number of iterations (say) n_0) framework to such recursions. We use these results to prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to the specified attractor when the iterates satisfy an ""asymptotic tightness"" condition. This, in turn, is shown to be useful in analyzing the tracking ability of general ""adaptive"" algorithms. Finally, we obtain the first informative error bounds on function approximation for the policy evaluation algorithm proposed by Basu et al. when the aim is to find the risk-sensitive cost represented using exponential utility. We show that this happens due to the absence of difference term in the earlier bound which is always present in all our bounds when the state space is large.",0

"Applying reinforcement learning to robotic systems poses a number of challenging problems. A key requirement is the ability to handle continuous state and action spaces while remaining within a limited time and resource budget. Additionally, for safe operation, the system must make robust decisions under hard constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a model based approach that combines Gaussian Process regression and Receding Horizon Control. Using sparse spectrum Gaussian Processes, we extend previous work by updating the dynamics model incrementally from a stream of sensory data. This results in an agent that can learn and plan in real-time under non-linear constraints. We test our approach on a cart pole swing-up environment and demonstrate the benefits of online learning on an autonomous racing task.

"The demand for more transparency of decision-making processes of deep reinforcement learning agents is greater than ever, due to their increased use in safety critical and ethically challenging domains such as autonomous driving. In this empirical study, we address this lack of transparency following an idea that is inspired by research in the field of neuroscience. We characterize the learned representations of an agent's policy network through its activation space and perform partial network ablations to compare the representations of the healthy and the intentionally damaged networks. We show that the healthy agent's behavior is characterized by a distinct correlation pattern between the network's layer activation and the performed actions during an episode and that network ablations, which cause a strong change of this pattern, lead to the agent failing its trained control task. Furthermore, the learned representation of the healthy agent is characterized by a distinct pattern in its activation space reflecting its different behavioral stages during an episode, which again, when distorted by network ablations, leads to the agent failing its trained control task. Concludingly, we argue in favor of a new perspective on artificial neural networks as objects of empirical investigations, just as biological neural systems in neuroscientific studies, paving the way towards a new standard of scientific falsifiability with respect to research on transparency and interpretability of artificial neural networks.",0

"By moving a depth sensor around a room, we compute a 3D CAD model of the environment, capturing the room shape and contents such as chairs, desks, sofas, and tables. Rather than reconstructing geometry, we match, place, and align each object in the scene to thousands of CAD models of objects. In addition to the fully automatic system, the key technical contribution is a novel approach for aligning CAD models to 3D scans, based on deep reinforcement learning. This approach, which we call Learning-based ICP, outperforms prior ICP methods in the literature, by learning the best points to match and conditioning on object viewpoint. LICP learns to align using only synthetic data and does not require ground truth annotation of object pose or keypoint pair matching in real scene scans. While LICP is trained on synthetic data and without 3D real scene annotations, it outperforms both learned local deep feature matching and geometric based alignment methods in real scenes.

"Traditionally, an object detector is applied to every part of the scene of interest, and its accuracy and computational cost increases with higher resolution images. However, in some application domains such as remote sensing, purchasing high spatial resolution images is expensive. To reduce the large computational and monetary cost associated with using high spatial resolution images, we propose a reinforcement learning agent that adaptively selects the spatial resolution of each image that is provided to the detector. In particular, we train the agent in a dual reward setting to choose low spatial resolution images to be run through a coarse level detector when the image is dominated by large objects, and high spatial resolution images to be run through a fine level detector when it is dominated by small objects. This reduces the dependency on high spatial resolution images for building a robust detector and increases run-time efficiency. We perform experiments on the xView dataset, consisting of large images, where we increase run-time efficiency by 50% and use high resolution images only 30% of the time while maintaining similar accuracy as a detector that uses only high resolution images.",0

"This paper proposes a framework for adaptively learning a feedback linearization-based tracking controller for an unknown system using discrete-time model-free policy-gradient parameter update rules. The primary advantage of the scheme over standard model-reference adaptive control techniques is that it does not require the learned inverse model to be invertible at all instances of time. This enables the use of general function approximators to approximate the linearizing controller for the system without having to worry about singularities. However, the discrete-time and stochastic nature of these algorithms precludes the direct application of standard machinery from the adaptive control literature to provide deterministic stability proofs for the system. Nevertheless, we leverage these techniques alongside tools from the stochastic approximation literature to demonstrate that with high probability the tracking and parameter errors concentrate near zero when a certain persistence of excitation condition is satisfied. A simulated example of a double pendulum demonstrates the utility of the proposed theory. 1",0

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been successfully applied in several research domains such as robot navigation and automated video game playing.

"Visual navigation is a task of training an embodied agent by intelligently navigating to a target object (e.g., television) using only visual observations. A key challenge for current deep reinforcement learning models lies in the requirements for a large amount of training data. It is exceedingly expensive to construct sufficient 3D synthetic environments annotated with the target object information. In this paper, we focus on visual navigation in the low-resource setting, where we have only a few training environments annotated with object information. We propose a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning approach to learn transferable meta-skills (e.g., bypass obstacles, go straight) from unannotated environments without any supervisory signals. The agent can then fast adapt to visual navigation through learning a high-level master policy to combine these meta-skills, when the visual-navigation-specified reward is provided. Evaluation in the AI2-THOR environments shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline by 53.34% relatively on SPL, and further qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method learns transferable motor primitives for visual navigation.",0

"Intrinsic motivation enables reinforcement learning (RL) agents to explore when rewards are very sparse, where traditional exploration heuristics such as Boltzmann or e-greedy would typically fail. However, intrinsic exploration is generally handled in an ad-hoc manner, where exploration is not treated as a core objective of the learning process; this weak formulation leads to sub-optimal exploration performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a framework based on multi-objective RL where both exploration and exploitation are being optimized as separate objectives. This formulation brings the balance between exploration and exploitation at a policy level, resulting in advantages over traditional methods. This also allows for controlling exploration while learning, at no extra cost. Such strategies achieve a degree of control over agent exploration that was previously unattainable with classic or intrinsic rewards. We demonstrate scalability to continuous state-action spaces by presenting a method (EMU-Q) based on our framework, guiding exploration towards regions of higher value-function uncertainty. EMU-Q is experimentally shown to outperform classic exploration techniques and other intrinsic RL methods on a continuous control benchmark and on a robotic manipulator.",0

We demonstrate its effectiveness on a continuous control benchmark and a robotic manipulator.",1
"The trend is to implement intelligent agents capable of analyzing available information and utilize it efficiently. This work presents a number of reinforcement learning (RL) architectures; one of them is designed for intelligent agents. The proposed architectures are called selector-actor-critic (SAC), tuner-actor-critic (TAC), and estimator-selector-actor-critic (ESAC). These architectures are improved models of a well known architecture in RL called actor-critic (AC). In AC, an actor optimizes the used policy, while a critic estimates a value function and evaluate the optimized policy by the actor. SAC is an architecture equipped with an actor, a critic, and a selector. The selector determines the most promising action at the current state based on the last estimate from the critic. TAC consists of a tuner, a model-learner, an actor, and a critic. After receiving the approximated value of the current state-action pair from the critic and the learned model from the model-learner, the tuner uses the Bellman equation to tune the value of the current state-action pair. ESAC is proposed to implement intelligent agents based on two ideas, which are lookahead and intuition. Lookahead appears in estimating the values of the available actions at the next state, while the intuition appears in maximizing the probability of selecting the most promising action. The newly added elements are an underlying model learner, an estimator, and a selector. The model learner is used to approximate the underlying model. The estimator uses the approximated value function, the learned underlying model, and the Bellman equation to estimate the values of all actions at the next state. The selector is used to determine the most promising action at the next state, which will be used by the actor to optimize the used policy. Finally, the results show the superiority of ESAC compared with the other architectures.",0

"The study of unsupervised learning can be generally divided into two categories: imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In imitation learning the machine learns by mimicking the behavior of an expert system whereas in reinforcement learning the machine learns via direct environment feedback.

This paper proposes Augmented Q-Imitation-Learning, a method by which deep reinforcement learning convergence can be accelerated by applying Q-imitation-learning as the initial training process in traditional Deep Q-learning.",0
"Unsupervised learning is typically categorized into two types: imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Imitation learning involves the machine mimicking the actions of an expert system, while reinforcement learning involves the machine learning from direct feedback from the environment. However, traditional deep reinforcement learning can take a significant amount of time to converge to an optimal policy.

"This work considers the sample and computational complexity of obtaining an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP), given only access to a generative model. In this work, we study the effectiveness of the most natural plug-in approach to model-based planning: we build the maximum likelihood estimate of the transition model in the MDP from observations and then find an optimal policy in this empirical MDP. We ask arguably the most basic and unresolved question in model based planning: is the naive ""plug-in"" approach, non-asymptotically, minimax optimal in the quality of the policy it finds, given a fixed sample size? Here, the non-asymptotic regime refers to when the sample size is sublinear in the model size.   With access to a generative model, we resolve this question in the strongest possible sense: our main result shows that \emph{any} high accuracy solution in the plug-in model constructed with $N$ samples, provides an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in the true underlying MDP (where $\epsilon$ is the minimax accuracy with $N$ samples at every state, action pair). In comparison, all prior (non-asymptotically) minimax optimal results use model free approaches, such as the Variance Reduced Q-value iteration algorithm (Sidford et al 2018), while the best known model-based results (e.g. Azar et al 2013) require larger sample sizes in their dependence on the planning horizon or the state space. Notably, we show that the model-based approach allows the use of \emph{any} efficient planning algorithm in the empirical MDP, which simplifies algorithm design as this approach does not tie the algorithm to the sampling procedure. The core of our analysis is avnovel ""absorbing MDP"" construction to address the statistical dependency issues that arise in the analysis of model-based planning approaches, a construction which may be helpful more generally.",0
"This study examines the complexity of obtaining an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP) using a generative model. The most common approach to model-based planning is to create a maximum likelihood estimate of the transition model in the MDP and then determine the optimal policy in this empirical MDP. The question of whether this ""plug-in"" approach is non-asymptotically minimax optimal in terms of policy quality given a fixed sample size is unresolved. The non-asymptotic regime refers to when the sample size is sublinear in the model size. Using a generative model, this study resolves this question by demonstrating that any high accuracy solution in the plug-in model constructed with N samples provides an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in the true underlying MDP. This result is stronger than prior minimax optimal results, which use model-free approaches, and the best known model-based results, which require larger sample sizes.

The study also introduces a novel ""absorbing MDP"" construction to address the statistical dependency issues that arise in the analysis of model-based planning approaches.",1
"We consider a novel application of inverse reinforcement learning with behavioral economics constraints to model, learn and predict the commenting behavior of YouTube viewers. Each group of users is modeled as a rationally inattentive Bayesian agent which solves a contextual bandit problem. Our methodology integrates three key components. First, to identify distinct commenting patterns, we use deep embedded clustering to estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that clusters users into distinct groups.Second, we present an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that uses Bayesian revealed preferences to test for rationality: does there exist a utility function that rationalizes the given data, and if yes, can it be used to predict commenting behavior? Finally, we impose behavioral economics constraints stemming from rational inattention to characterize the attention span of groups of users. The test imposes a R{\'e}nyi mutual information cost constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. After a careful analysis of a massive YouTube dataset, our surprising result is that in most YouTube user groups, the commenting behavior is consistent with optimizing a Bayesian utility with rationally inattentive constraints. The paper also highlights how the rational inattention model can accurately predict commenting behavior. The massive YouTube dataset and analysis used in this paper are available on GitHub and completely reproducible.",0

"This paper introduces Meta-Q-Learning (MQL), a new off-policy algorithm for meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL). MQL builds upon three simple ideas. First, we show that Q-learning is competitive with state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms if given access to a context variable that is a representation of the past trajectory. Second, a multi-task objective to maximize the average reward across the training tasks is an effective method to meta-train RL policies. Third, past data from the meta-training replay buffer can be recycled to adapt the policy on a new task using off-policy updates. MQL draws upon ideas in propensity estimation to do so and thereby amplifies the amount of available data for adaptation. Experiments on standard continuous-control benchmarks suggest that MQL compares favorably with the state of the art in meta-RL.",0

"As deep reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to more tasks, there is a need to visualize and understand the behavior of learned agents. Saliency maps explain agent behavior by highlighting the features of the input state that are most relevant for the agent in taking an action. Existing perturbation-based approaches to compute saliency often highlight regions of the input that are not relevant to the action taken by the agent. Our proposed approach, SARFA (Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution), generates more focused saliency maps by balancing two aspects (specificity and relevance) that capture different desiderata of saliency. The first captures the impact of perturbation on the relative expected reward of the action to be explained. The second downweighs irrelevant features that alter the relative expected rewards of actions other than the action to be explained. We compare SARFA with existing approaches on agents trained to play board games (Chess and Go) and Atari games (Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders). We show through illustrative examples (Chess, Atari, Go), human studies (Chess), and automated evaluation methods (Chess) that SARFA generates saliency maps that are more interpretable for humans than existing approaches. For the code release and demo videos, see https://nikaashpuri.github.io/sarfa-saliency/.",0

"This paper investigates how to efficiently transition and update policies, trained initially with demonstrations, using off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning. It is well-known that techniques based on Learning from Demonstrations, for example behavior cloning, can lead to proficient policies given limited data. However, it is currently unclear how to efficiently update that policy using reinforcement learning as these approaches are inherently optimizing different objective functions. Previous works have used loss functions, which combine behavior cloning losses with reinforcement learning losses to enable this update. However, the components of these loss functions are often set anecdotally, and their individual contributions are not well understood. In this work, we propose the Cycle-of-Learning (CoL) framework that uses an actor-critic architecture with a loss function that combines behavior cloning and 1-step Q-learning losses with an off-policy pre-training step from human demonstrations. This enables transition from behavior cloning to reinforcement learning without performance degradation and improves reinforcement learning in terms of overall performance and training time. Additionally, we carefully study the composition of these combined losses and their impact on overall policy learning. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for combining behavior cloning and reinforcement learning for both dense and sparse reward scenarios. Our results also suggest that directly including the behavior cloning loss on demonstration data helps to ensure stable learning and ground future policy updates.",0

"Air traffic control is an example of a highly challenging operational problem that is readily amenable to human expertise augmentation via decision support technologies. In this paper, we propose a new intelligent decision making framework that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to dynamically suggest adjustments of aircraft speeds in real-time. The goal of the system is to enhance the ability of an air traffic controller to provide effective guidance to aircraft to avoid air traffic congestion, near-miss situations, and to improve arrival timeliness. We develop a novel deep ensemble MARL method that can concisely capture the complexity of the air traffic control problem by learning to efficiently arbitrate between the decisions of a local kernel-based RL model and a wider-reaching deep MARL model. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on an open-source air traffic management simulator developed by Eurocontrol. Extensive empirical results on a real-world dataset including thousands of aircraft demonstrate the feasibility of using multi-agent RL for the problem of en-route air traffic control and show that our proposed deep ensemble MARL method significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art benchmark approaches.",0

"While maximizing expected return is the goal in most reinforcement learning approaches, risk-sensitive objectives such as conditional value at risk (CVaR) are more suitable for many high-stakes applications. However, relatively little is known about how to explore to quickly learn policies with good CVaR. In this paper, we present the first algorithm for sample-efficient learning of CVaR-optimal policies in Markov decision processes based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle. This method relies on a novel optimistic version of the distributional Bellman operator that moves probability mass from the lower to the upper tail of the return distribution. We prove asymptotic convergence and optimism of this operator for the tabular policy evaluation case. We further demonstrate that our algorithm finds CVaR-optimal policies substantially faster than existing baselines in several simulated environments with discrete and continuous state spaces.",0

"Although in recent years reinforcement learning has become very popular the number of successful applications to different kinds of operations research problems is rather scarce. Reinforcement learning is based on the well-studied dynamic programming technique and thus also aims at finding the best stationary policy for a given Markov Decision Process, but in contrast does not require any model knowledge. The policy is assessed solely on consecutive states (or state-action pairs), which are observed while an agent explores the solution space. The contributions of this paper are manifold. First we provide deep theoretical insights to the widely applied standard discounted reinforcement learning framework, which give rise to the understanding of why these algorithms are inappropriate when permanently provided with non-zero rewards, such as costs or profit. Second, we establish a novel near-Blackwell-optimal reinforcement learning algorithm. In contrary to former method it assesses the average reward per step separately and thus prevents the incautious combination of different types of state values. Thereby, the Laurent Series expansion of the discounted state values forms the foundation for this development and also provides the connection between the two approaches. Finally, we prove the viability of our algorithm on a challenging problem set, which includes a well-studied M/M/1 admission control queuing system. In contrast to standard discounted reinforcement learning our algorithm infers the optimal policy on all tested problems. The insights are that in the operations research domain machine learning techniques have to be adapted and advanced to successfully apply these methods in our settings.",0

"We demonstrate the first reinforcement-learning application for robots equipped with an event camera. Because of the considerably lower latency of the event camera, it is possible to achieve much faster control of robots compared with the existing vision-based reinforcement-learning applications using standard cameras. To handle a stream of events for reinforcement learning, we introduced an image-like feature and demonstrated the feasibility of training an agent in a simulator for two tasks: fast collision avoidance and obstacle tracking. Finally, we set up a robot with an event camera in the real world and then transferred the agent trained in the simulator, resulting in successful fast avoidance of randomly thrown objects. Incorporating event camera into reinforcement learning opens new possibilities for various robotics applications that require swift control, such as autonomous vehicles and drones, through end-to-end learning approaches.",0

"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its superiority on many complex sequential decision-making problems. However, heavy dependence on dense rewards and high sample-complexity impedes the wide adoption of these methods in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, imitation learning (IL) learns effectively in sparse-rewarded tasks by leveraging the existing expert demonstrations. In practice, collecting a sufficient amount of expert demonstrations can be prohibitively expensive, and the quality of demonstrations typically limits the performance of the learning policy. In this work, we propose Self-Adaptive Imitation Learning (SAIL) that can achieve (near) optimal performance given only a limited number of sub-optimal demonstrations for highly challenging sparse reward tasks. SAIL bridges the advantages of IL and RL to reduce the sample complexity substantially, by effectively exploiting sup-optimal demonstrations and efficiently exploring the environment to surpass the demonstrated performance. Extensive empirical results show that not only does SAIL significantly improve the sample-efficiency but also leads to much better final performance across different continuous control tasks, comparing to the state-of-the-art.",0

"Motivated by the many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL) that require safe-policy iterations, we consider the problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) -- the problem of evaluating a new policy using the historical data obtained by different behavior policies -- under the model of nonstationary episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with a long horizon and a large action space. Existing importance sampling (IS) methods often suffer from large variance that depends exponentially on the RL horizon $H$. To solve this problem, we consider a marginalized importance sampling (MIS) estimator that recursively estimates the state marginal distribution for the target policy at every step. MIS achieves a mean-squared error of $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum\nolimits_{t=1}^H\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\left[\frac{d_t^\pi(s_t)^2}{d_t^\mu(s_t)^2} \mathrm{Var}_{\mu}\left[\frac{\pi_t(a_t|s_t)}{\mu_t(a_t|s_t)}\big( V_{t+1}^\pi(s_{t+1}) + r_t\big) \middle| s_t\right]\right] + \tilde{O}(n^{-1.5}) $$ where $\mu$ and $\pi$ are the logging and target policies, $d_t^{\mu}(s_t)$ and $d_t^{\pi}(s_t)$ are the marginal distribution of the state at $t$th step, $H$ is the horizon, $n$ is the sample size and $V_{t+1}^\pi$ is the value function of the MDP under $\pi$. The result matches the Cramer-Rao lower bound in \citet{jiang2016doubly} up to a multiplicative factor of $H$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OPE estimation error bound with a polynomial dependence on $H$. Besides theory, we show empirical superiority of our method in time-varying, partially observable, and long-horizon RL environments.",0

"We propose Stochastic Neural Architecture Search (SNAS), an economical end-to-end solution to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that trains neural operation parameters and architecture distribution parameters in same round of back-propagation, while maintaining the completeness and differentiability of the NAS pipeline. In this work, NAS is reformulated as an optimization problem on parameters of a joint distribution for the search space in a cell. To leverage the gradient information in generic differentiable loss for architecture search, a novel search gradient is proposed. We prove that this search gradient optimizes the same objective as reinforcement-learning-based NAS, but assigns credits to structural decisions more efficiently. This credit assignment is further augmented with locally decomposable reward to enforce a resource-efficient constraint. In experiments on CIFAR-10, SNAS takes less epochs to find a cell architecture with state-of-the-art accuracy than non-differentiable evolution-based and reinforcement-learning-based NAS, which is also transferable to ImageNet. It is also shown that child networks of SNAS can maintain the validation accuracy in searching, with which attention-based NAS requires parameter retraining to compete, exhibiting potentials to stride towards efficient NAS on big datasets.

"Maximizing utility with a budget constraint is the primary goal for advertisers in real-time bidding (RTB) systems. The policy maximizing the utility is referred to as the optimal bidding strategy. Earlier works on optimal bidding strategy apply model-based batch reinforcement learning methods which can not generalize to unknown budget and time constraint. Further, the advertiser observes a censored market price which makes direct evaluation infeasible on batch test datasets. Previous works ignore the losing auctions to alleviate the difficulty with censored states; thus significantly modifying the test distribution. We address the challenge of lacking a clear evaluation procedure as well as the error propagated through batch reinforcement learning methods in RTB systems. We exploit two conditional independence structures in the sequential bidding process that allow us to propose a novel practical framework using the maximum entropy principle to imitate the behavior of the true distribution observed in real-time traffic. Moreover, the framework allows us to train a model that can generalize to the unseen budget conditions than limit only to those observed in history. We compare our methods on two real-world RTB datasets with several baselines and demonstrate significantly improved performance under various budget settings.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen great advancements in the past few years. Nevertheless, the consensus among the RL community is that currently used methods, despite all their benefits, suffer from extreme data inefficiency, especially in the rich visual domains like Atari. To circumvent this problem, novel approaches were introduced that often claim to be much more efficient than popular variations of the state-of-the-art DQN algorithm. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that the newly proposed techniques simply used unfair baselines in their experiments. Namely, we show that the actual improvement in the efficiency came from allowing the algorithm for more training updates for each data sample, and not from employing the new methods. By allowing DQN to execute network updates more frequently we manage to reach similar or better results than the recently proposed advancement, often at a fraction of complexity and computational costs. Furthermore, based on the outcomes of the study, we argue that the agent similar to the modified DQN that is presented in this paper should be used as a baseline for any future work aimed at improving sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning.",0

"Incorporating the optimization principle of momentum into reinforcement learning, we view the state-action value functions as equivalents to optimization gradients, and consider momentum as the mean value of consecutive $q$-functions. This leads us to introduce Momentum Value Iteration (MoVI), a modified version of Value Iteration that integrates the momentum concept. Our study demonstrates that MoVI can smooth out errors across iterations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this technique can be effortlessly extended to deep learning, and we suggest a straightforward enhancement to DQN based on MoVI, which we evaluate through experimentation on Atari games.",1
"A common challenge in reinforcement learning is how to convert the agent's interactions with an environment into fast and robust learning. For instance, earlier work makes use of domain knowledge to improve existing reinforcement learning algorithms in complex tasks. While promising, previously acquired knowledge is often costly and challenging to scale up. Instead, we decide to consider problem knowledge with signals from quantities relevant to solve any task, e.g., self-performance assessment and accurate expectations. $\mathcal{V}^{ex}$ is such a quantity. It is the fraction of variance explained by the value function $V$ and measures the discrepancy between $V$ and the returns. Taking advantage of $\mathcal{V}^{ex}$, we propose MERL, a general framework for structuring reinforcement learning by injecting problem knowledge into policy gradient updates. As a result, the agent is not only optimized for a reward but learns using problem-focused quantities provided by MERL, applicable out-of-the-box to any task. In this paper: (a) We introduce and define MERL, the multi-head reinforcement learning framework we use throughout this work. (b) We conduct experiments across a variety of standard benchmark environments, including 9 continuous control tasks, where results show improved performance. (c) We demonstrate that MERL also improves transfer learning on a set of challenging pixel-based tasks. (d) We ponder how MERL tackles the problem of reward sparsity and better conditions the feature space of reinforcement learning agents.",0
"One of the main obstacles in reinforcement learning is finding ways to enable the agent to learn quickly and effectively from its interactions with the environment.

The quantity $\mathcal{V}^{ex}$, which measures the discrepancy between the value function and the returns, is one such quantity that we leverage.

We also discuss how MERL addresses the issue of reward sparsity and conditions the feature space of reinforcement learning agents.",1
"Parameter space exploration methods with black-box optimization have recently been shown to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in continuous control reinforcement learning domains. In this paper, we examine reasons why these methods work better and the situations in which they are worse than traditional action space exploration methods. Through a simple theoretical analysis, we show that when the parametric complexity required to solve the reinforcement learning problem is greater than the product of action space dimensionality and horizon length, exploration in action space is preferred. This is also shown empirically by comparing simple exploration methods on several toy problems.",0
Recent studies have demonstrated that black-box optimization-based parameter space exploration techniques surpass the latest approaches in continuous control reinforcement learning fields. This paper aims to investigate why these methods are more successful and when they are less effective compared to traditional action space exploration methods. Our theoretical analysis indicates that exploration in action space is preferable when the reinforcement learning problem necessitates greater parametric complexity than the product of horizon length and action space dimensionality. This finding is reinforced by our empirical analysis of various toy problems using simple exploration methods.,1
"We present an algorithm based on posterior sampling (aka Thompson sampling) that achieves near-optimal worst-case regret bounds when the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) is communicating with a finite, though unknown, diameter. Our main result is a high probability regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(DS\sqrt{AT})$ for any communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions and diameter $D$. Here, regret compares the total reward achieved by the algorithm to the total expected reward of an optimal infinite-horizon undiscounted average reward policy, in time horizon $T$. This result closely matches the known lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{DSAT})$.

"Epidemics of infectious diseases are an important threat to public health and global economies. Yet, the development of prevention strategies remains a challenging process, as epidemics are non-linear and complex processes. For this reason, we investigate a deep reinforcement learning approach to automatically learn prevention strategies in the context of pandemic influenza. Firstly, we construct a new epidemiological meta-population model, with 379 patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Our model balances complexity and computational efficiency such that the use of reinforcement learning techniques becomes attainable. Secondly, we set up a ground truth such that we can evaluate the performance of the 'Proximal Policy Optimization' algorithm to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, we consider a large-scale problem, by conducting an experiment where we aim to learn a joint policy to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space. Moreover, through this experiment, we demonstrate that there can be an advantage to consider collaboration between districts when designing prevention strategies.",0

"Overestimation of the maximum action-value is a well-known problem that hinders Q-Learning performance, leading to suboptimal policies and unstable learning. Among several Q-Learning variants proposed to address this issue, Weighted Q-Learning (WQL) effectively reduces the bias and shows remarkable results in stochastic environments. WQL uses a weighted sum of the estimated action-values, where the weights correspond to the probability of each action-value being the maximum; however, the computation of these probabilities is only practical in the tabular settings. In this work, we provide the methodological advances to benefit from the WQL properties in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), by using neural networks with Dropout Variational Inference as an effective approximation of deep Gaussian processes. In particular, we adopt the Concrete Dropout variant to obtain calibrated estimates of epistemic uncertainty in DRL. We show that model uncertainty in DRL can be useful not only for action selection, but also action evaluation. We analyze how the novel Weighted Deep Q-Learning algorithm reduces the bias w.r.t. relevant baselines and provide empirical evidence of its advantages on several representative benchmarks.",0

"As Computer Vision moves from a passive analysis of pixels to active analysis of semantics, the breadth of information algorithms need to reason over has expanded significantly. One of the key challenges in this vein is the ability to identify the information required to make a decision, and select an action that will recover it. We propose a reinforcement-learning approach that maintains a distribution over its internal information, thus explicitly representing the ambiguity in what it knows, and needs to know, towards achieving its goal. Potential actions are then generated according to this distribution. For each potential action a distribution of the expected outcomes is calculated, and the value of the potential information gain assessed. The action taken is that which maximizes the potential information gain. We demonstrate this approach applied to two vision-and-language problems that have attracted significant recent interest, visual dialog and visual query generation. In both cases, the method actively selects actions that will best reduce its internal uncertainty and outperforms its competitors in achieving the goal of the challenge.",0

"$ $Let $F$ be a multivariate function from a product set $\Sigma^n$ to an Abelian group $G$.

"A typical domain adaptation approach is to adapt models trained on the annotated data in a source domain (e.g., sunny weather) for achieving high performance on the test data in a target domain (e.g., rainy weather). Whether the target contains a single homogeneous domain or multiple heterogeneous domains, existing works always assume that there exist clear distinctions between the domains, which is often not true in practice (e.g., changes in weather). We study an open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) problem, in which the target is a compound of multiple homogeneous domains without domain labels, reflecting realistic data collection from mixed and novel situations. We propose a new approach based on two technical insights into OCDA: 1) a curriculum domain adaptation strategy to bootstrap generalization across domains in a data-driven self-organizing fashion and 2) a memory module to increase the model's agility towards novel domains. Our experiments on digit classification, facial expression recognition, semantic segmentation, and reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0

"In batch reinforcement learning (RL), one often constrains a learned policy to be close to the behavior (data-generating) policy, e.g., by constraining the learned action distribution to differ from the behavior policy by some maximum degree that is the same at each state. This can cause batch RL to be overly conservative, unable to exploit large policy changes at frequently-visited, high-confidence states without risking poor performance at sparsely-visited states. To remedy this, we propose residual policies, where the allowable deviation of the learned policy is state-action-dependent. We derive a new for RL method, BRPO, which learns both the policy and allowable deviation that jointly maximize a lower bound on policy performance. We show that BRPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a number of tasks.",0
"Batch reinforcement learning (RL) often limits a learned policy to closely resemble the behavior policy by restricting the learned action distribution to have a maximum difference from the behavior policy at every state.

To address this, we suggest residual policies that have state-action-dependent allowances for learned policy deviations. We introduce a new RL method, BRPO, that learns both the policy and allowable deviation, optimizing a lower bound on policy performance. Our results demonstrate that BRPO performs exceptionally well in various tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art performance.",1
"To effect behavior change a successful algorithm must make high-quality decisions in real-time. For example, a mobile health (mHealth) application designed to increase physical activity must make contextually relevant suggestions to motivate users. While machine learning offers solutions for certain stylized settings, such as when batch data can be processed offline, there is a dearth of approaches which can deliver high-quality solutions under the specific constraints of mHealth. We propose an algorithm which provides users with contextualized and personalized physical activity suggestions. This algorithm is able to overcome a challenge critical to mHealth that complex models be trained efficiently.

"Learning visual similarity requires to learn relations, typically between triplets of images. Albeit triplet approaches being powerful, their computational complexity mostly limits training to only a subset of all possible training triplets. Thus, sampling strategies that decide when to use which training sample during learning are crucial. Currently, the prominent paradigm are fixed or curriculum sampling strategies that are predefined before training starts. However, the problem truly calls for a sampling process that adjusts based on the actual state of the similarity representation during training. We, therefore, employ reinforcement learning and have a teacher network adjust the sampling distribution based on the current state of the learner network, which represents visual similarity. Experiments on benchmark datasets using standard triplet-based losses show that our adaptive sampling strategy significantly outperforms fixed sampling strategies. Moreover, although our adaptive sampling is only applied on top of basic triplet-learning frameworks, we reach competitive results to state-of-the-art approaches that employ diverse additional learning signals or strong ensemble architectures.

"Black-box adversarial attacks on video recognition models have been explored. Considering the temporal interactions between frames, a few methods try to select some key frames, and then perform attacks on them. Unfortunately, their selecting strategy is independent with the attacking step, resulting in the limited performance. Instead, we argue the frame selection phase is closely relevant with the attacking phase. The key frames should be adjusted according to the attacking results. For that, we formulate the black-box video attacks into Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Specifically, the environment in RL is set as the threat model, and the agent in RL plays the role of frame selecting. By continuously querying the threat models and receiving the attacking feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its frame selection strategy and adversarial perturbations become smaller and smaller. A series of experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce the adversarial perturbations with efficient query times.",0

"Off-policy estimation for long-horizon problems is important in many real-life applications such as healthcare and robotics, where high-fidelity simulators may not be available and on-policy evaluation is expensive or impossible.

"Adversarial learning has shown its advances in generating natural and diverse descriptions in image captioning. However, the learned reward of existing adversarial methods is vague and ill-defined due to the reward ambiguity problem. In this paper, we propose a refined Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (rAIRL) method to handle the reward ambiguity problem by disentangling reward for each word in a sentence, as well as achieve stable adversarial training by refining the loss function to shift the generator towards Nash equilibrium. In addition, we introduce a conditional term in the loss function to mitigate mode collapse and to increase the diversity of the generated descriptions. Our experiments on MS COCO and Flickr30K show that our method can learn compact reward for image captioning.",0

"Social Reinforcement Learning methods, which model agents in large networks, are useful for fake news mitigation, personalized teaching/healthcare, and viral marketing, but it is challenging to incorporate inter-agent dependencies into the models effectively due to network size and sparse interaction data. Previous social RL approaches either ignore agents dependencies or model them in a computationally intensive manner. In this work, we incorporate agent dependencies efficiently in a compact model by clustering users (based on their payoff and contribution to the goal) and combine this with a method to easily derive personalized agent-level policies from cluster-level policies. We also propose a dynamic clustering approach that captures changing user behavior. Experiments on real-world datasets illustrate that our proposed approach learns more accurate policy estimates and converges more quickly, compared to several baselines that do not use agent correlations or only use static clusters.",0

"In multi-agent games, the complexity of the environment can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases, so it is particularly challenging to learn good policies when the agent population is large. In this paper, we introduce Evolutionary Population Curriculum (EPC), a curriculum learning paradigm that scales up Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by progressively increasing the population of training agents in a stage-wise manner. Furthermore, EPC uses an evolutionary approach to fix an objective misalignment issue throughout the curriculum: agents successfully trained in an early stage with a small population are not necessarily the best candidates for adapting to later stages with scaled populations. Concretely, EPC maintains multiple sets of agents in each stage, performs mix-and-match and fine-tuning over these sets and promotes the sets of agents with the best adaptability to the next stage. We implement EPC on a popular MARL algorithm, MADDPG, and empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin as the number of agents grows exponentially.",0

"Relational Reinforcement Learning (RRL) can offers various desirable features. Most importantly, it allows for incorporating expert knowledge into the learning, and hence leading to much faster learning and better generalization compared to the standard deep reinforcement learning. However, most of the existing RRL approaches are either incapable of incorporating expert background knowledge (e.g., in the form of explicit predicate language) or are not able to learn directly from non-relational data such as image. In this paper, we propose a novel deep RRL based on a differentiable Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that can effectively learn relational information from image and present the state of the environment as first order logic predicates. Additionally, it can take the expert background knowledge and incorporate it into the learning problem using appropriate predicates. The differentiable ILP allows an end to end optimization of the entire framework for learning the policy in RRL. We show the efficacy of this novel RRL framework using environments such as BoxWorld, GridWorld as well as relational reasoning for the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset.",0

"Unmanned Surface Vehicles technology (USVs) is an exciting topic that essentially deploys an algorithm to safely and efficiently performs a mission. Although reinforcement learning is a well-known approach to modeling such a task, instability and divergence may occur when combining off-policy and function approximation. In this work, we used deep reinforcement learning combining Q-learning with a neural representation to avoid instability. Our methodology uses deep q-learning and combines it with a rolling wave planning approach on agile methodology. Our method contains two critical parts in order to perform missions in an unknown environment. The first is a path planner that is responsible for generating a potential effective path to a destination without considering the details of the root. The latter is a decision-making module that is responsible for short-term decisions on avoiding obstacles during the near future steps of USV exploitation within the context of the value function. Simulations were performed using two algorithms: a basic vanilla vessel navigator (VVN) as a baseline and an improved one for the vessel navigator with a planner and local view (VNPLV). Experimental results show that the proposed method enhanced the performance of VVN by 55.31 on average for long-distance missions. Our model successfully demonstrated obstacle avoidance by means of deep reinforcement learning using planning adaptive paths in unknown environments.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning has proven to be successful for learning tasks in simulated environments, but applying same techniques for robots in real-world domain is more challenging, as they require hours of training. To address this, transfer learning can be used to train the policy first in a simulated environment and then transfer it to physical agent. As the simulation never matches reality perfectly, the physics, visuals and action spaces by necessity differ between these environments to some degree. In this work, we study how general video games can be directly used instead of fine-tuned simulations for the sim-to-real transfer. Especially, we study how the agent can learn the new action space autonomously, when the game actions do not match the robot actions. Our results show that the different action space can be learned by re-training only part of neural network and we obtain above 90% mean success rate in simulation and robot experiments.",0

However, since simulations cannot perfectly replicate reality, there are differences in the physics, visuals, and action spaces between the two environments. In this study, we explore the possibility of utilizing general video games instead of customized simulations for the sim-to-real transfer and investigate how the agent can learn a new action space independently, even when the game actions do not match the robot actions. Our findings indicate that by re-training only a portion of the neural network, the agent can effectively learn the different action space, achieving a mean success rate of over 90% in both simulation and robot experiments.",1
"In recent years, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) has gained a notable momentum in the research community. MFO is known for its inherent capability to efficiently address multiple optimization tasks at the same time, while transferring information among such tasks to improve their convergence speed. On the other hand, the quantum leap made by Deep Q Learning (DQL) in the Machine Learning field has allowed facing Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems of unprecedented complexity. Unfortunately, complex DQL models usually find it difficult to converge to optimal policies due to the lack of exploration or sparse rewards. In order to overcome these drawbacks, pre-trained models are widely harnessed via Transfer Learning, extrapolating knowledge acquired in a source task to the target task. Besides, meta-heuristic optimization has been shown to reduce the lack of exploration of DQL models. This work proposes a MFO framework capable of simultaneously evolving several DQL models towards solving interrelated RL tasks. Specifically, our proposed framework blends together the benefits of meta-heuristic optimization, Transfer Learning and DQL to automate the process of knowledge transfer and policy learning of distributed RL agents. A thorough experimentation is presented and discussed so as to assess the performance of the framework, its comparison to the traditional methodology for Transfer Learning in terms of convergence, speed and policy quality , and the intertask relationships found and exploited over the search process.",0

"This paper presents the concept of an adaptive safe padding that forces Reinforcement Learning (RL) to synthesise optimal control policies while ensuring safety during the learning process. Policies are synthesised to satisfy a goal, expressed as a temporal logic formula, with maximal probability. Enforcing the RL agent to stay safe during learning might limit the exploration, however we show that the proposed architecture is able to automatically handle the trade-off between efficient progress in exploration (towards goal satisfaction) and ensuring safety. Theoretical guarantees are available on the optimality of the synthesised policies and on the convergence of the learning algorithm.

"In this paper, we propose the problem of collaborative perception, where robots can combine their local observations with those of neighboring agents in a learnable way to improve accuracy on a perception task. Unlike existing work in robotics and multi-agent reinforcement learning, we formulate the problem as one where learned information must be shared across a set of agents in a bandwidth-sensitive manner to optimize for scene understanding tasks such as semantic segmentation. Inspired by networking communication protocols, we propose a multi-stage handshake communication mechanism where the neural network can learn to compress relevant information needed for each stage. Specifically, a target agent with degraded sensor data sends a compressed request, the other agents respond with matching scores, and the target agent determines who to connect with (i.e., receive information from). We additionally develop the AirSim-CP dataset and metrics based on the AirSim simulator where a group of aerial robots perceive diverse landscapes, such as roads, grasslands, buildings, etc. We show that for the semantic segmentation task, our handshake communication method significantly improves accuracy by approximately 20% over decentralized baselines, and is comparable to centralized ones using a quarter of the bandwidth.",0

"This paper focuses on finding reinforcement learning policies for control systems with hard state and action constraints. Despite its success in many domains, reinforcement learning is challenging to apply to problems with hard constraints, especially if both the state variables and actions are constrained. Previous works seeking to ensure constraint satisfaction, or safety, have focused on adding a projection step to a learned policy. Yet, this approach requires solving an optimization problem at every policy execution step, which can lead to significant computational costs.   To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a new approach, termed Vertex Networks (VNs), with guarantees on safety during exploration and on learned control policies by incorporating the safety constraints into the policy network architecture. Leveraging the geometric property that all points within a convex set can be represented as the convex combination of its vertices, the proposed algorithm first learns the convex combination weights and then uses these weights along with the pre-calculated vertices to output an action. The output action is guaranteed to be safe by construction. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed VN algorithm outperforms vanilla reinforcement learning in a variety of benchmark control tasks.",0

"We address a core problem of computer vision: Detection and description of 2D feature points for image matching. For a long time, hand-crafted designs, like the seminal SIFT algorithm, were unsurpassed in accuracy and efficiency. Recently, learned feature detectors emerged that implement detection and description using neural networks. Training these networks usually resorts to optimizing low-level matching scores, often pre-defining sets of image patches which should or should not match, or which should or should not contain key points. Unfortunately, increased accuracy for these low-level matching scores does not necessarily translate to better performance in high-level vision tasks. We propose a new training methodology which embeds the feature detector in a complete vision pipeline, and where the learnable parameters are trained in an end-to-end fashion. We overcome the discrete nature of key point selection and descriptor matching using principles from reinforcement learning. As an example, we address the task of relative pose estimation between a pair of images. We demonstrate that the accuracy of a state-of-the-art learning-based feature detector can be increased when trained for the task it is supposed to solve at test time. Our training methodology poses little restrictions on the task to learn, and works for any architecture which predicts key point heat maps, and descriptors for key point locations.",0

"It is well known that quantifying uncertainty in the action-value estimates is crucial for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning. Ensemble sampling offers a relatively computationally tractable way of doing this using randomized value functions. However, it still requires a huge amount of computational resources for complex problems. In this paper, we present an alternative, computationally efficient way to induce exploration using index sampling. We use an indexed value function to represent uncertainty in our action-value estimates. We first present an algorithm to learn parameterized indexed value function through a distributional version of temporal difference in a tabular setting and prove its regret bound.

"An agent with an inaccurate model of its environment faces a difficult choice: it can ignore the errors in its model and act in the real world in whatever way it determines is optimal with respect to its model. Alternatively, it can take a more conservative stance and eschew its model in favor of optimizing its behavior solely via real-world interaction. This latter approach can be exceedingly slow to learn from experience, while the former can lead to ""planner overfitting"" - aspects of the agent's behavior are optimized to exploit errors in its model. This paper explores an intermediate position in which the planner seeks to avoid overfitting through a kind of regularization of the plans it considers. We present three different approaches that demonstrably mitigate planner overfitting in reinforcement-learning environments.",0

"Our aim is to establish a framework where reinforcement learning (RL) of optimizing interventions retrospectively allows us a regulatory compliant pathway to prospective clinical testing of the learned policies in a clinical deployment.

Our framework consists of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent and an inverse dynamics model contesting with each other. The former collects training samples for the latter, with an objective to maximize the error of the latter. The latter is trained with samples collected by the former, and generates rewards for the former when it fails to predict the actual action taken by the former. In such a competitive setting, the DRL agent learns to generate samples that the inverse dynamics model fails to predict correctly, while the inverse dynamics model learns to adapt to the challenging samples. We further propose a reward structure that ensures the DRL agent to collect only moderately hard samples but not overly hard ones that prevent the inverse model from predicting effectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on several robotic arm and hand manipulation tasks against multiple baseline models. Experimental results show that our method is comparable to those directly trained with expert demonstrations, and superior to the other baselines even without any human priors.",0
"Our study introduces an adversarial active exploration method to learn an inverse dynamics model without any human intervention. This approach employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent and an inverse dynamics model to compete with one another. The DRL agent gathers training data for the inverse dynamics model while attempting to maximize its error. The inverse dynamics model, on the other hand, is trained with the data collected by the DRL agent and rewards the agent when it fails to predict the actual action. This competitive environment motivates the DRL agent to generate challenging samples that the inverse dynamics model cannot predict accurately, while the inverse dynamics model adapts to these samples. We also suggest a reward system that ensures the DRL agent only gathers moderately difficult samples, preventing the inverse dynamics model from being ineffective. We assess the effectiveness of our method on several robotic arm and hand manipulation tasks and compare it with multiple baseline models. The results indicate that our technique is comparable to those trained directly with expert demonstrations and superior to other baselines without any human priors.",1
"Reinforcement learning systems require good representations to work well. For decades practical success in reinforcement learning was limited to small domains. Deep reinforcement learning systems, on the other hand, are scalable, not dependent on domain specific prior knowledge and have been successfully used to play Atari, in 3D navigation from pixels, and to control high degree of freedom robots. Unfortunately, the performance of deep reinforcement learning systems is sensitive to hyper-parameter settings and architecture choices. Even well tuned systems exhibit significant instability both within a trial and across experiment replications. In practice, significant expertise and trial and error are usually required to achieve good performance. One potential source of the problem is known as catastrophic interference: when later training decreases performance by overriding previous learning. Interestingly, the powerful generalization that makes Neural Networks (NN) so effective in batch supervised learning might explain the challenges when applying them in reinforcement learning tasks. In this paper, we explore how online NN training and interference interact in reinforcement learning. We find that simply re-mapping the input observations to a high-dimensional space improves learning speed and parameter sensitivity. We also show this preprocessing reduces interference in prediction tasks. More practically, we provide a simple approach to NN training that is easy to implement, and requires little additional computation. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance in both prediction and control with an extensive batch of experiments in classic control domains.",0
"Good representations are essential for reinforcement learning systems to function effectively. Although reinforcement learning was previously limited to small domains, deep reinforcement learning systems have proven to be scalable and successful in playing Atari, navigating 3D environments, and controlling complex robots without relying on domain-specific prior knowledge. However, the performance of these systems is highly sensitive to hyper-parameter settings and architecture choices, and even well-tuned systems exhibit significant instability and require extensive trial and error. This may be due to catastrophic interference, where later training overrides previous learning and decreases performance. Online neural network training and interference may exacerbate these challenges. In this study, we investigate the interaction between online neural network training and interference in reinforcement learning and demonstrate that mapping input observations to a high-dimensional space can improve learning speed and reduce interference in prediction tasks. Our approach is easy to implement and requires minimal additional computation, and we show improved performance in both prediction and control tasks through a series of experiments in classic control domains.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning can learn effective policies for a wide range of tasks, but is notoriously difficult to use due to instability and sensitivity to hyperparameters. The reasons for this remain unclear. When using standard supervised methods (e.g., for bandits), on-policy data collection provides ""hard negatives"" that correct the model in precisely those states and actions that the policy is likely to visit. We call this phenomenon ""corrective feedback."" We show that bootstrapping-based Q-learning algorithms do not necessarily benefit from this corrective feedback, and training on the experience collected by the algorithm is not sufficient to correct errors in the Q-function. In fact, Q-learning and related methods can exhibit pathological interactions between the distribution of experience collected by the agent and the policy induced by training on that experience, leading to potential instability, sub-optimal convergence, and poor results when learning from noisy, sparse or delayed rewards. We demonstrate the existence of this problem, both theoretically and empirically. We then show that a specific correction to the data distribution can mitigate this issue. Based on these observations, we propose a new algorithm, DisCor, which computes an approximation to this optimal distribution and uses it to re-weight the transitions used for training, resulting in substantial improvements in a range of challenging RL settings, such as multi-task learning and learning from noisy reward signals. Blog post presenting a summary of this work is available at: https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/03/16/discor/.",0

"For effective matching of resources (e.g., taxis, food, bikes, shopping items) to customer demand, aggregation systems have been extremely successful. In aggregation systems, a central entity (e.g., Uber, Food Panda, Ofo) aggregates supply (e.g., drivers, delivery personnel) and matches demand to supply on a continuous basis (sequential decisions). Due to the objective of the central entity to maximize its profits, individual suppliers get sacrificed thereby creating incentive for individuals to leave the system. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning approximate equilibrium solutions (win-win solutions) in aggregation systems, so that individuals have an incentive to remain in the aggregation system.   Unfortunately, such systems have thousands of agents and have to consider demand uncertainty and the underlying problem is a (Partially Observable) Stochastic Game. Given the significant complexity of learning or planning in a stochastic game, we make three key contributions: (a) To exploit infinitesimally small contribution of each agent and anonymity (reward and transitions between agents are dependent on agent counts) in interactions, we represent this as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem that builds on insights from non-atomic congestion games model; (b) We provide a novel variance reduction mechanism for moving joint solution towards Nash Equilibrium that exploits the infinitesimally small contribution of each agent; and finally (c) We provide detailed results on three different domains to demonstrate the utility of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn a dynamic model to reduce the number of interactions with real-world environments. However, due to estimation error, rollouts in the learned model, especially those of long horizons, fail to match the ones in real-world environments. This mismatching has seriously impacted the sample complexity of MBRL. The phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that previous works employ supervised learning to learn the one-step transition models, which has inherent difficulty ensuring the matching of distributions from multi-step rollouts. Based on the claim, we propose to learn the transition model by matching the distributions of multi-step rollouts sampled from the transition model and the real ones via WGAN. We theoretically show that matching the two can minimize the difference of cumulative rewards between the real transition and the learned one. Our experiments also show that the proposed Model Imitation method can compete or outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of sample complexity and average return.",0

"The vast majority of visual animals actively control their eyes, heads, and/or bodies to direct their gaze toward different parts of their environment. In contrast, recent applications of reinforcement learning in robotic manipulation employ cameras as passive sensors. These are carefully placed to view a scene from a fixed pose. Active perception allows animals to gather the most relevant information about the world and focus their computational resources where needed. It also enables them to view objects from different distances and viewpoints, providing a rich visual experience from which to learn abstract representations of the environment. Inspired by the primate visual-motor system, we present a framework that leverages the benefits of active perception to accomplish manipulation tasks. Our agent uses viewpoint changes to localize objects, to learn state representations in a self-supervised manner, and to perform goal-directed actions. We apply our model to a simulated grasping task with a 6-DoF action space. Compared to its passive, fixed-camera counterpart, the active model achieves 8% better performance in targeted grasping.

"We explore deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent domains. We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows. We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multi-agent coordination. Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies. We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.",0

"The landmark achievements of AlphaGo Zero have created great research interest into self-play in reinforcement learning. In self-play, Monte Carlo Tree Search is used to train a deep neural network, that is then used in tree searches. Training itself is governed by many hyperparameters.There has been surprisingly little research on design choices for hyper-parameter values and loss-functions, presumably because of the prohibitive computational cost to explore the parameter space. In this paper, we investigate 12 hyper-parameters in an AlphaZero-like self-play algorithm and evaluate how these parameters contribute to training. We use small games, to achieve meaningful exploration with moderate computational effort. The experimental results show that training is highly sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. Through multi-objective analysis we identify 4 important hyper-parameters to further assess. To start, we find surprising results where too much training can sometimes lead to lower performance. Our main result is that the number of self-play iterations subsumes MCTS-search simulations, game-episodes, and training epochs. The intuition is that these three increase together as self-play iterations increase, and that increasing them individually is sub-optimal. A consequence of our experiments is a direct recommendation for setting hyper-parameter values in self-play: the overarching outer-loop of self-play iterations should be maximized, in favor of the three inner-loop hyper-parameters, which should be set at lower values. A secondary result of our experiments concerns the choice of optimization goals, for which we also provide recommendations.",0

"A common technique to improve learning performance in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and many other machine learning algorithms is to run multiple learning agents in parallel. A neglected component in the development of these algorithms has been how best to arrange the learning agents involved to improve distributed search. Here we draw upon results from the networked optimization literatures suggesting that arranging learning agents in communication networks other than fully connected topologies (the implicit way agents are commonly arranged in) can improve learning. We explore the relative performance of four popular families of graphs and observe that one such family (Erdos-Renyi random graphs) empirically outperforms the de facto fully-connected communication topology across several DRL benchmark tasks. Additionally, we observe that 1000 learning agents arranged in an Erdos-Renyi graph can perform as well as 3000 agents arranged in the standard fully-connected topology, showing the large learning improvement possible when carefully designing the topology over which agents communicate. We complement these empirical results with a theoretical investigation of why our alternate topologies perform better. Overall, our work suggests that distributed machine learning algorithms could be made more effective if the communication topology between learning agents was optimized.",0

"We hypothesize that curiosity is a mechanism found by evolution that encourages meaningful exploration early in an agent's life in order to expose it to experiences that enable it to obtain high rewards over the course of its lifetime. We formulate the problem of generating curious behavior as one of meta-learning: an outer loop will search over a space of curiosity mechanisms that dynamically adapt the agent's reward signal, and an inner loop will perform standard reinforcement learning using the adapted reward signal. However, current meta-RL methods based on transferring neural network weights have only generalized between very similar tasks. To broaden the generalization, we instead propose to meta-learn algorithms: pieces of code similar to those designed by humans in ML papers. Our rich language of programs combines neural networks with other building blocks such as buffers, nearest-neighbor modules and custom loss functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach empirically, finding two novel curiosity algorithms that perform on par or better than human-designed published curiosity algorithms in domains as disparate as grid navigation with image inputs, acrobot, lunar lander, ant and hopper.",0

"This paper proposes the first-ever algorithmic framework for tuning hyper-parameters of stochastic optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning. Hyper-parameters impose significant influences on the performance of stochastic optimization algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and meta-heuristics. Yet, it is very time-consuming to determine optimal hyper-parameters due to the stochastic nature of these algorithms. We propose to model the tuning procedure as a Markov decision process, and resort the policy gradient algorithm to tune the hyper-parameters. Experiments on tuning stochastic algorithms with different kinds of hyper-parameters (continuous and discrete) for different optimization problems (continuous and discrete) show that the proposed hyper-parameter tuning algorithms do not require much less running times of the stochastic algorithms than bayesian optimization method. The proposed framework can be used as a standard tool for hyper-parameter tuning in stochastic algorithms.",0

This framework can be used as a standardized tool for hyper-parameter tuning in stochastic algorithms.",1
"The advancement of artificial intelligence has cast a new light on the development of optimization algorithm. This paper proposes to learn a two-phase (including a minimization phase and an escaping phase) global optimization algorithm for smooth non-convex functions. For the minimization phase, a model-driven deep learning method is developed to learn the update rule of descent direction, which is formalized as a nonlinear combination of historical information, for convex functions. We prove that the resultant algorithm with the proposed adaptive direction guarantees convergence for convex functions. Empirical study shows that the learned algorithm significantly outperforms some well-known classical optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, conjugate descent and BFGS, and performs well on ill-posed functions. The escaping phase from local optimum is modeled as a Markov decision process with a fixed escaping policy. We further propose to learn an optimal escaping policy by reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of the escaping policies is verified by optimizing synthesized functions and training a deep neural network for CIFAR image classification. The learned two-phase global optimization algorithm demonstrates a promising global search capability on some benchmark functions and machine learning tasks.",0

"In this paper, we study a transfer reinforcement learning problem where the state transitions and rewards are affected by the environmental context. Specifically, we consider a demonstrator agent that has access to a context-aware policy and can generate transition and reward data based on that policy. These data constitute the experience of the demonstrator. Then, the goal is to transfer this experience, excluding the underlying contextual information, to a learner agent that does not have access to the environmental context, so that they can learn a control policy using fewer samples. It is well known that, disregarding the causal effect of the contextual information, can introduce bias in the transition and reward models estimated by the learner, resulting in a learned suboptimal policy. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a method to obtain causal bounds on the transition and reward functions using the demonstrator's data, which we then use to obtain causal bounds on the value functions. Using these value function bounds, we propose new Q learning and UCB-Q learning algorithms that converge to the true value function without bias. We provide numerical experiments for robot motion planning problems that validate the proposed value function bounds and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively make use of the data from the demonstrator to accelerate the learning process of the learner.",0

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) in various decision-making tasks of machine learning provides effective results with an agent learning from a stand-alone reward function. However, it presents unique challenges with large amounts of environment states and action spaces, as well as in the determination of rewards. This complexity, coming from high dimensionality and continuousness of the environments considered herein, calls for a large number of learning trials to learn about the environment through Reinforcement Learning. Imitation Learning (IL) offers a promising solution for those challenges using a teacher. In IL, the learning process can take advantage of human-sourced assistance and/or control over the agent and environment. A human teacher and an agent learner are considered in this study. The teacher takes part in the agent training towards dealing with the environment, tackling a specific objective, and achieving a predefined goal. Within that paradigm, however, existing IL approaches have the drawback of expecting extensive demonstration information in long-horizon problems. This paper proposes a novel approach combining IL with different types of RL methods, namely state action reward state action (SARSA) and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) agents, to overcome the problems of both stand-alone systems. It is addressed how to effectively leverage the teacher feedback, be it direct binary or indirect detailed for the agent learner to learn sequential decision-making policies. The results of this study on various OpenAI Gym environments show that this algorithmic method can be incorporated with different combinations, significantly decreases both human endeavor and tedious exploration process.",0

"Despite the wealth of research into provably efficient reinforcement learning algorithms, most works focus on tabular representation and thus struggle to handle exponentially or infinitely large state-action spaces. In this paper, we consider episodic reinforcement learning with a continuous state-action space which is assumed to be equipped with a natural metric that characterizes the proximity between different states and actions. We propose ZoomRL, an online algorithm that leverages ideas from continuous bandits to learn an adaptive discretization of the joint space by zooming in more promising and frequently visited regions while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration trade-off. We show that ZoomRL achieves a worst-case regret $\tilde{O}(H^{\frac{5}{2}} K^{\frac{d+1}{d+2}})$ where $H$ is the planning horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes and $d$ is the covering dimension of the space with respect to the metric.

"The in-memory computing paradigm with emerging memory devices has been recently shown to be a promising way to accelerate deep learning. Resistive processing unit (RPU) has been proposed to enable the vector-vector outer product in a crossbar array using a stochastic train of identical pulses to enable one-shot weight update, promising intense speed-up in matrix multiplication operations, which form the bulk of training neural networks. However, the performance of the system suffers if the device does not satisfy the condition of linear conductance change over around 1,000 conductance levels. This is a challenge for nanoscale memories. Recently, Charge Trap Flash (CTF) memory was shown to have a large number of levels before saturation, but variable non-linearity. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between the range of conductance change and linearity. We show, through simulations, that at an optimum choice of the range, our system performs nearly as well as the models trained using exact floating point operations, with less than 1% reduction in the performance.

"Machines are a long way from robustly solving open-world perception-control tasks, such as first-person view (FPV) aerial navigation. While recent advances in end-to-end Machine Learning, especially Imitation and Reinforcement Learning appear promising, they are constrained by the need of large amounts of difficult-to-collect labeled real-world data. Simulated data, on the other hand, is easy to generate, but generally does not render safe behaviors in diverse real-life scenarios. In this work we propose a novel method for learning robust visuomotor policies for real-world deployment which can be trained purely with simulated data. We develop rich state representations that combine supervised and unsupervised environment data. Our approach takes a cross-modal perspective, where separate modalities correspond to the raw camera data and the system states relevant to the task, such as the relative pose of gates to the drone in the case of drone racing. We feed both data modalities into a novel factored architecture, which learns a joint low-dimensional embedding via Variational Auto Encoders. This compact representation is then fed into a control policy, which we trained using imitation learning with expert trajectories in a simulator. We analyze the rich latent spaces learned with our proposed representations, and show that the use of our cross-modal architecture significantly improves control policy performance as compared to end-to-end learning or purely unsupervised feature extractors. We also present real-world results for drone navigation through gates in different track configurations and environmental conditions.

"In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL), agents learn to cooperatively take actions as a team to maximize a total team reward. We analyze the robustness of c-MARL to adversaries capable of attacking one of the agents on a team. Through the ability to manipulate this agent's observations, the adversary seeks to decrease the total team reward.   Attacking c-MARL is challenging for three reasons: first, it is difficult to estimate team rewards or how they are impacted by an agent mispredicting; second, models are non-differentiable; and third, the feature space is low-dimensional. Thus, we introduce a novel attack. The attacker first trains a policy network with reinforcement learning to find a wrong action it should encourage the victim agent to take. Then, the adversary uses targeted adversarial examples to force the victim to take this action.   Our results on the StartCraft II multi-agent benchmark demonstrate that c-MARL teams are highly vulnerable to perturbations applied to one of their agent's observations. By attacking a single agent, our attack method has highly negative impact on the overall team reward, reducing it from 20 to 9.4. This results in the team's winning rate to go down from 98.9% to 0%.",0
"The goal of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) is to teach agents how to work together to gain the highest possible team reward. We wanted to see how c-MARL would hold up against attackers who target one of the agents on the team. These attackers can manipulate the agent's observations to lower the overall team reward. Unfortunately, attacking c-MARL is not easy due to the difficulty of estimating team rewards, non-differentiable models, and low-dimensional feature spaces. As a result, we developed a new method for attacking c-MARL. First, we trained a policy network using reinforcement learning to find an action that would harm the victim agent. Then, we used targeted adversarial examples to force the victim agent to take this action. Our experiments on the StartCraft II multi-agent benchmark showed that c-MARL teams are highly susceptible to attacks on individual agents. By attacking just one agent, our method reduced the team's overall reward from 20 to 9.4, resulting in a 98.9% decrease in their winning rate.",1
"There have been increasing challenges to solve combinatorial optimization problems by machine learning.

"Many current behavior generation methods struggle to handle real-world traffic situations as they do not scale well with complexity. However, behaviors can be learned off-line using data-driven approaches. Especially, reinforcement learning is promising as it implicitly learns how to behave utilizing collected experiences. In this work, we combine policy-based reinforcement learning with local optimization to foster and synthesize the best of the two methodologies. The policy-based reinforcement learning algorithm provides an initial solution and guiding reference for the post-optimization. Therefore, the optimizer only has to compute a single homotopy class, e.g.\ drive behind or in front of the other vehicle. By storing the state-history during reinforcement learning, it can be used for constraint checking and the optimizer can account for interactions. The post-optimization additionally acts as a safety-layer and the novel method, thus, can be applied in safety-critical applications. We evaluate the proposed method using lane-change scenarios with a varying number of vehicles.",0

"Producing agents that can generalize to a wide range of visually different environments is a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. One method for overcoming this issue is visual domain randomization, whereby at the start of each training episode some visual aspects of the environment are randomized so that the agent is exposed to many possible variations. However, domain randomization is highly inefficient and may lead to policies with high variance across domains. Instead, we propose a regularization method whereby the agent is only trained on one variation of the environment, and its learned state representations are regularized during training to be invariant across domains. We conduct experiments that demonstrate that our technique leads to more efficient and robust learning than standard domain randomization, while achieving equal generalization scores.",0

"Portfolio Selection is an important real-world financial task and has attracted extensive attention in artificial intelligence communities. This task, however, has two main difficulties: (i) the non-stationary price series and complex asset correlations make the learning of feature representation very hard; (ii) the practicality principle in financial markets requires controlling both transaction and risk costs. Most existing methods adopt handcraft features and/or consider no constraints for the costs, which may make them perform unsatisfactorily and fail to control both costs in practice. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive portfolio selection method with deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a novel two-stream portfolio policy network is devised to extract both price series patterns and asset correlations, while a new cost-sensitive reward function is developed to maximize the accumulated return and constrain both costs via reinforcement learning. We theoretically analyze the near-optimality of the proposed reward, which shows that the growth rate of the policy regarding this reward function can approach the theoretical optimum. We also empirically evaluate the proposed method on real-world datasets. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in terms of profitability, cost-sensitivity and representation abilities.",0

"Measuring the quality of a generated sequence against a set of references is a central problem in many learning frameworks, be it to compute a score, to assign a reward, or to perform discrimination. Despite great advances in model architectures, metrics that scale independently of the number of references are still based on n-gram estimates. We show that the underlying operations, counting words and comparing counts, can be lifted to embedding words and comparing embeddings. An in-depth analysis of BERT embeddings shows empirically that contextual embeddings can be employed to capture the required dependencies while maintaining the necessary scalability through appropriate pruning and smoothing techniques. We cast unconditional generation as a reinforcement learning problem and show that our reward function indeed provides a more effective learning signal than n-gram reward in this challenging setting.",0

"We propose a reinforcement learning framework for discrete environments in which an agent makes both strategic and tactical decisions. The former manifests itself through the use of value function, while the latter is powered by a tree search planner. These tools complement each other. The planning module performs a local \textit{what-if} analysis, which allows to avoid tactical pitfalls and boost backups of the value function. The value function, being global in nature, compensates for inherent locality of the planner. In order to further solidify this synergy, we introduce an exploration mechanism with two distinctive components: uncertainty modelling and risk measurement. To model the uncertainty we use value function ensembles, and to reflect risk we use propose several functionals that summarize the implied by the ensemble. We show that our method performs well on hard exploration environments: Deep-sea, toy Montezuma's Revenge, and Sokoban. In all the cases, we obtain speed-up in learning and boost in performance.",0

"The emergence of structured databases for Question Answering (QA) systems has led to developing methods, in which the problem of learning the correct answer efficiently is based on a linking task between the constituents of the question and the corresponding entries in the database.

However, most datasets for QA systems lack gold annotations for parsing, i.e., labels are only available in the form of (question, formal-query, answer). In this paper, we propose a distantly supervised learning framework based on reinforcement learning to learn the mentions of entities and relations in questions. We leverage the provided formal queries to characterize delayed rewards for optimizing a policy gradient objective for the parsing model.

"Most meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods learn to adapt to new tasks by directly optimizing the parameters of policies over primitive action space.

Combined with smoothed WDs, the dual formulation allows us to devise efficient algorithms that take stochastic gradient descent steps through WD regularizers. We incorporate these regularizers into two novel on-policy algorithms, Behavior-Guided Policy Gradient and Behavior-Guided Evolution Strategies, which we demonstrate can outperform existing methods in a variety of challenging environments.

"The most data-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning in robotics are model-based policy search algorithms, which alternate between learning a dynamical model of the robot and optimizing a policy to maximize the expected return given the model and its uncertainties. However, the current algorithms lack an effective exploration strategy to deal with sparse or misleading reward scenarios: if they do not experience any state with a positive reward during the initial random exploration, it is very unlikely to solve the problem. Here, we propose a novel model-based policy search algorithm, Multi-DEX, that leverages a learned dynamical model to efficiently explore the task space and solve tasks with sparse rewards in a few episodes. To achieve this, we frame the policy search problem as a multi-objective, model-based policy optimization problem with three objectives: (1) generate maximally novel state trajectories, (2) maximize the expected return and (3) keep the system in state-space regions for which the model is as accurate as possible. We then optimize these objectives using a Pareto-based multi-objective optimization algorithm. The experiments show that Multi-DEX is able to solve sparse reward scenarios (with a simulated robotic arm) in much lower interaction time than VIME, TRPO, GEP-PG, CMA-ES and Black-DROPS.",0

"In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for trajectory optimization for constrained dynamical systems. This problem is motivated by the fact that for most robotic systems, the dynamics may not always be known. Generating smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories could be difficult for such systems. Using sampling-based algorithms for motion planning may result in trajectories that are prone to undesirable control jumps. However, they can usually provide a good reference trajectory which a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm can then exploit by limiting the search domain and quickly finding a dynamically smooth trajectory. We use this idea to train a reinforcement learning agent to learn a dynamically smooth trajectory in a curriculum learning setting. Furthermore, for generalization, we parameterize the policies with goal locations, so that the agent can be trained for multiple goals simultaneously. We show result in both simulated environments as well as real experiments, for a $6$-DoF manipulator arm operated in position-controlled mode to validate the proposed idea. We compare the proposed ideas against a PID controller which is used to track a designed trajectory in configuration space. Our experiments show that our RL agent trained with a reference path outperformed a model-free PID controller of the type commonly used on many robotic platforms for trajectory tracking.",0
"The aim of this study is to suggest an algorithm based on reinforcement learning for optimizing trajectories in constrained dynamical systems.

"Q-learning with neural network function approximation (neural Q-learning for short) is among the most prevalent deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Despite its empirical success, the non-asymptotic convergence rate of neural Q-learning remains virtually unknown. In this paper, we present a finite-time analysis of a neural Q-learning algorithm, where the data are generated from a Markov decision process and the action-value function is approximated by a deep ReLU neural network. We prove that neural Q-learning finds the optimal policy with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate if the neural function approximator is sufficiently overparameterized, where $T$ is the number of iterations.

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is capable of learning high-performing policies on a variety of complex high-dimensional tasks, ranging from video games to robotic manipulation. However, standard DRL methods often suffer from poor sample efficiency, partially because they aim to be entirely problem-agnostic. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to exploration and hierarchical skill learning that derives its sample efficiency from intuitive assumptions it makes about the behavior of objects both in the physical world and simulations which mimic physics. Specifically, we propose the Hypothesis Proposal and Evaluation (HyPE) algorithm, which discovers objects from raw pixel data, generates hypotheses about the controllability of observed changes in object state, and learns a hierarchy of skills to test these hypotheses. We demonstrate that HyPE can dramatically improve the sample efficiency of policy learning in two different domains: a simulated robotic block-pushing domain, and a popular benchmark task: Breakout. In these domains, HyPE learns high-scoring policies an order of magnitude faster than several state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.",0

"A common approach for defining a reward function for Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) problems is the weighted sum of the multiple objectives. The weights are then treated as design parameters dependent on the expertise (and preference) of the person performing the learning, with the typical result that a new solution is required for any change in these settings. This paper investigates the relationship between the reward function and the optimal value function for MORL; specifically addressing the question of how to approximate the optimal value function well beyond the set of weights for which the optimization problem was actually solved, thereby avoiding the need to recompute for any particular choice. We prove that the value function transforms smoothly given a transformation of weights of the reward function (and thus a smooth interpolation in the policy space). A Gaussian process is used to obtain a smooth interpolation over the reward function weights of the optimal value function for three well-known examples: GridWorld, Objectworld and Pendulum. The results show that the interpolation can provide very robust values for sample states and action space in discrete and continuous domain problems. Significant advantages arise from utilizing this interpolation technique in the domain of autonomous vehicles: easy, instant adaptation of user preferences while driving and true randomization of obstacle vehicle behavior preferences during training.",0

"In this paper, we consider the problem of building learning agents that can efficiently learn to navigate in constrained environments. The main goal is to design agents that can efficiently learn to understand and generalize to different environments using high-dimensional inputs (a 2D map), while following feasible paths that avoid obstacles in obstacle-cluttered environment. To achieve this, we make use of traditional path planning algorithms, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms in a synergistic way. The key idea is to decouple the navigation problem into planning and control, the former of which is achieved by supervised learning whereas the latter is done by reinforcement learning. Specifically, we train a deep convolutional network that can predict collision-free paths based on a map of the environment-- this is then used by a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn to closely follow the path. This allows the trained agent to achieve good generalization while learning faster. We test our proposed method in the recently proposed Safety Gym suite that allows testing of safety-constraints during training of learning agents. We compare our proposed method with existing work and show that our method consistently improves the sample efficiency and generalization capability to novel environments.",0

"Group activities usually involve spatiotemporal dynamics among many interactive individuals, while only a few participants at several key frames essentially define the activity. Therefore, effectively modeling the group-relevant and suppressing the irrelevant actions (and interactions) are vital for group activity recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on deep reinforcement learning to progressively refine the low-level features and high-level relations of group activities. Firstly, we construct a semantic relation graph (SRG) to explicitly model the relations among persons. Then, two agents adopting policy according to two Markov decision processes are applied to progressively refine the SRG. Specifically, one feature-distilling (FD) agent in the discrete action space refines the low-level spatio-temporal features by distilling the most informative frames. Another relation-gating (RG) agent in continuous action space adjusts the high-level semantic graph to pay more attention to group-relevant relations. The SRG, FD agent, and RG agent are optimized alternately to mutually boost the performance of each other. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",0

"Despite recent success of deep network-based Reinforcement Learning (RL), it remains elusive to achieve human-level efficiency in learning novel tasks. While previous efforts attempt to address this challenge using meta-learning strategies, they typically suffer from sampling inefficiency with on-policy RL algorithms or meta-overfitting with off-policy learning. In this work, we propose a novel meta-RL strategy to address those limitations. In particular, we decompose the meta-RL problem into three sub-tasks, task-exploration, task-inference and task-fulfillment, instantiated with two deep network agents and a task encoder. During meta-training, our method learns a task-conditioned actor network for task-fulfillment, an explorer network with a self-supervised reward shaping that encourages task-informative experiences in task-exploration, and a context-aware graph-based task encoder for task inference. We validate our approach with extensive experiments on several public benchmarks and the results show that our algorithm effectively performs exploration for task inference, improves sample efficiency during both training and testing, and mitigates the meta-overfitting problem.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is attracting increasing interests in autonomous driving due to its potential to solve complex classification and control problems. However, existing RL algorithms are rarely applied to real vehicles for two predominant problems: behaviours are unexplainable, and they cannot guarantee safety under new scenarios. This paper presents a safe RL algorithm, called Parallel Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO), for two autonomous driving tasks. PCPO extends today's common actor-critic architecture to a three-component learning framework, in which three neural networks are used to approximate the policy function, value function and a newly added risk function, respectively. Meanwhile, a trust region constraint is added to allow large update steps without breaking the monotonic improvement condition. To ensure the feasibility of safety constrained problems, synchronized parallel learners are employed to explore different state spaces, which accelerates learning and policy-update. The simulations of two scenarios for autonomous vehicles confirm we can ensure safety while achieving fast learning.",0

"In this study, we investigate the use of global information to speed up the learning process and increase the cumulative rewards of reinforcement learning (RL) in competition tasks. Within the actor-critic RL, we introduce multiple cooperative critics from two levels of the hierarchy and propose a reinforcement learning from hierarchical critics (RLHC) algorithm. In our approach, each agent receives value information from local and global critics regarding a competition task and accesses multiple cooperative critics in a top-down hierarchy. Thus, each agent not only receives low-level details but also considers coordination from higher levels, thereby obtaining global information to improve the training performance.

"In the present paper, we propose an extension of the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), also referred to as PlaNet of the Bayesians (PlaNet-Bayes). There has been a growing demand in model predictive control (MPC) in partially observable environments in which complete information is unavailable because of, for example, lack of expensive sensors. PlaNet is a promising solution to realize such latent MPC, as it is used to train state-space models via model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and to conduct planning in the latent space. However, recent state-of-the-art strategies mentioned in MBRR literature, such as involving uncertainty into training and planning, have not been considered, significantly suppressing the training performance. The proposed extension is to make PlaNet uncertainty-aware on the basis of Bayesian inference, in which both model and action uncertainty are incorporated. Uncertainty in latent models is represented using a neural network ensemble to approximately infer model posteriors. The ensemble of optimal action candidates is also employed to capture multimodal uncertainty in the optimality. The concept of the action ensemble relies on a general variational inference MPC (VI-MPC) framework and its instance, probabilistic action ensemble with trajectory sampling (PaETS). In this paper, we extend VI-MPC and PaETS, which have been originally introduced in previous literature, to address partially observable cases. We experimentally compare the performances on continuous control tasks, and conclude that our method can consistently improve the asymptotic performance compared with PlaNet.",0

"Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges of model-free reinforcement learning. Instead of solely relying on extrinsic rewards provided by the environment, many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, we show that existing methods fall short in procedurally-generated environments where an agent is unlikely to visit a state more than once. We propose a novel type of intrinsic reward which encourages the agent to take actions that lead to significant changes in its learned state representation. We evaluate our method on multiple challenging procedurally-generated tasks in MiniGrid, as well as on tasks with high-dimensional observations used in prior work. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is more sample efficient than existing exploration methods, particularly for procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments. Furthermore, we analyze the learned behavior as well as the intrinsic reward received by our agent. In contrast to previous approaches, our intrinsic reward does not diminish during the course of training and it rewards the agent substantially more for interacting with objects that it can control.",0

"Conventional video summarization approaches based on reinforcement learning have the problem that the reward can only be received after the whole summary is generated. Such kind of reward is sparse and it makes reinforcement learning hard to converge. Another problem is that labelling each frame is tedious and costly, which usually prohibits the construction of large-scale datasets. To solve these problems, we propose a weakly supervised hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, which decomposes the whole task into several subtasks to enhance the summarization quality. This framework consists of a manager network and a worker network. For each subtask, the manager is trained to set a subgoal only by a task-level binary label, which requires much fewer labels than conventional approaches. With the guide of the subgoal, the worker predicts the importance scores for video frames in the subtask by policy gradient according to both global reward and innovative defined sub-rewards to overcome the sparse problem. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our proposal has achieved the best performance, even better than supervised approaches.",0

"Value-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Q-learning have shown success in a variety of domains. One challenge in applying Q-learning to continuous-action RL problems, however, is the continuous action maximization (max-Q) required for optimal Bellman backup. In this work, we develop CAQL, a (class of) algorithm(s) for continuous-action Q-learning that can use several plug-and-play optimizers for the max-Q problem. Leveraging recent optimization results for deep neural networks, we show that max-Q can be solved optimally using mixed-integer programming (MIP). When the Q-function representation has sufficient power, MIP-based optimization gives rise to better policies and is more robust than approximate methods (e.g., gradient ascent, cross-entropy search). We further develop several techniques to accelerate inference in CAQL, which despite their approximate nature, perform well.

"Reinforcement learning has shown much success in games such as chess, backgammon and Go. However, in most of these games, agents have full knowledge of the environment at all times. In this paper, we describe a deep learning model that successfully optimizes its score using reinforcement learning in a game with incomplete and imperfect information. We apply our model to FlipIt, a two-player game in which both players, the attacker and the defender, compete for ownership of a shared resource and only receive information on the current state (such as the current owner of the resource, or the time since the opponent last moved, etc.) upon making a move. Our model is a deep neural network combined with Q-learning and is trained to maximize the defender's time of ownership of the resource. Despite the imperfect observations, our model successfully learns an optimal cost-effective counter-strategy and shows the advantages of the use of deep reinforcement learning in game theoretic scenarios.

"Exploration is critical to a reinforcement learning agent's performance in its given environment. Prior exploration methods are often based on using heuristic auxiliary predictions to guide policy behavior, lacking a mathematically-grounded objective with clear properties. In contrast, we recast exploration as a problem of State Marginal Matching (SMM), where we aim to learn a policy for which the state marginal distribution matches a given target state distribution. The target distribution is a uniform distribution in most cases, but can incorporate prior knowledge if available. In effect, SMM amortizes the cost of learning to explore in a given environment. The SMM objective can be viewed as a two-player, zero-sum game between a state density model and a parametric policy, an idea that we use to build an algorithm for optimizing the SMM objective. Using this formalism, we further demonstrate that prior work approximately maximizes the SMM objective, offering an explanation for the success of these methods. On both simulated and real-world tasks, we demonstrate that agents that directly optimize the SMM objective explore faster and adapt more quickly to new tasks as compared to prior exploration methods.",0

In this paper, we compare first and higher-order optimization functions and our experiments show that Levemberg-Marquardt (LM) has optimal convergence but suffers from large processing time, increasing the complexity of classification and reinforcement learning problems. Our experiments compare off-the-shelf optimization functions(CG, SGD, LM and L-BFGS) in standard CIFAR, MNIST, CartPole, and FlappyBird experiments. We argue which optimization functions to use and suggest parallelization efforts to improve pretraining time and learning rate convergence.",1
"The central tenet of reinforcement learning (RL) is that agents seek to maximize the sum of cumulative rewards. In contrast, active inference, an emerging framework within cognitive and computational neuroscience, proposes that agents act to maximize the evidence for a biased generative model. Here, we illustrate how ideas from active inference can augment traditional RL approaches by (i) furnishing an inherent balance of exploration and exploitation, and (ii) providing a more flexible conceptualization of reward. Inspired by active inference, we develop and implement a novel objective for decision making, which we term the free energy of the expected future. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm successfully balances exploration and exploitation, simultaneously achieving robust performance on several challenging RL benchmarks with sparse, well-shaped, and no rewards.",0

"Modern deep learning methods provide effective means to learn good representations. However, is a good representation itself sufficient for sample efficient reinforcement learning? This question has largely been studied only with respect to (worst-case) approximation error, in the more classical approximate dynamic programming literature. With regards to the statistical viewpoint, this question is largely unexplored, and the extant body of literature mainly focuses on conditions which permit sample efficient reinforcement learning with little understanding of what are necessary conditions for efficient reinforcement learning.   This work shows that, from the statistical viewpoint, the situation is far subtler than suggested by the more traditional approximation viewpoint, where the requirements on the representation that suffice for sample efficient RL are even more stringent. Our main results provide sharp thresholds for reinforcement learning methods, showing that there are hard limitations on what constitutes good function approximation (in terms of the dimensionality of the representation), where we focus on natural representational conditions relevant to value-based, model-based, and policy-based learning. These lower bounds highlight that having a good (value-based, model-based, or policy-based) representation in and of itself is insufficient for efficient reinforcement learning, unless the quality of this approximation passes certain hard thresholds. Furthermore, our lower bounds also imply exponential separations on the sample complexity between 1) value-based learning with perfect representation and value-based learning with a good-but-not-perfect representation, 2) value-based learning and policy-based learning, 3) policy-based learning and supervised learning and 4) reinforcement learning and imitation learning.",0

"One crucial aspect of partial domain adaptation (PDA) is how to select the relevant source samples in the shared classes for knowledge transfer. Previous PDA methods tackle this problem by re-weighting the source samples based on their high-level information (deep features). However, since the domain shift between source and target domains, only using the deep features for sample selection is defective. We argue that it is more reasonable to additionally exploit the pixel-level information for PDA problem, as the appearance difference between outlier source classes and target classes is significantly large. In this paper, we propose a reinforced transfer network (RTNet), which utilizes both high-level and pixel-level information for PDA problem. Our RTNet is composed of a reinforced data selector (RDS) based on reinforcement learning (RL), which filters out the outlier source samples, and a domain adaptation model which minimizes the domain discrepancy in the shared label space. Specifically, in the RDS, we design a novel reward based on the reconstruct errors of selected source samples on the target generator, which introduces the pixel-level information to guide the learning of RDS. Besides, we develope a state containing high-level information, which used by the RDS for sample selection. The proposed RDS is a general module, which can be easily integrated into existing DA models to make them fit the PDA situation. Extensive experiments indicate that RTNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance for PDA tasks on several benchmark datasets.",0

"We study the estimation of risk-sensitive policies in reinforcement learning problems defined by a Markov Decision Process (MDPs) whose state and action spaces are countably finite. Prior efforts are predominately afflicted by computational challenges associated with the fact that risk-sensitive MDPs are time-inconsistent. To ameliorate this issue, we propose a new definition of risk, which we call caution, as a penalty function added to the dual objective of the linear programming (LP) formulation of reinforcement learning. The caution measures the distributional risk of a policy, which is a function of the policy's long-term state occupancy distribution. To solve this problem in an online model-free manner, we propose a stochastic variant of primal-dual method that uses Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence as its proximal term. We establish that the number of iterations/samples required to attain approximately optimal solutions of this scheme matches tight dependencies on the cardinality of the state and action spaces, but differs in its dependence on the infinity norm of the gradient of the risk measure. Experiments demonstrate the merits of this approach for improving the reliability of reward accumulation without additional computational burdens.",0

"Value functions derived from Markov decision processes arise as a central component of algorithms as well as performance metrics in many statistics and engineering applications of machine learning techniques. Computation of the solution to the associated Bellman equations is challenging in most practical cases of interest. A popular class of approximation techniques, known as Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithms, are an important sub-class of general reinforcement learning methods. The algorithms introduced in this paper are intended to resolve two well-known difficulties of TD-learning approaches: Their slow convergence due to very high variance, and the fact that, for the problem of computing the relative value function, consistent algorithms exist only in special cases. First we show that the gradients of these value functions admit a representation that lends itself to algorithm design. Based on this result, a new class of differential TD-learning algorithms is introduced. For Markovian models on Euclidean space with smooth dynamics, the algorithms are shown to be consistent under general conditions. Numerical results show dramatic variance reduction when compared to standard methods.",0

"Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is concerned with learning a rewarding policy by executing another policy that gathers samples of experience. While the former policy (i.e. target policy) is rewarding but in-expressive (in most cases, deterministic), doing well in the latter task, in contrast, requires an expressive policy (i.e. behavior policy) that offers guided and effective exploration. Contrary to most methods that make a trade-off between optimality and expressiveness, disentangled frameworks explicitly decouple the two objectives, which each is dealt with by a distinct separate policy. Although being able to freely design and optimize the two policies with respect to their own objectives, naively disentangling them can lead to inefficient learning or stability issues. To mitigate this problem, our proposed method Analogous Disentangled Actor-Critic (ADAC) designs analogous pairs of actors and critics. Specifically, ADAC leverages a key property about Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to constraint the expressive energy-based behavior policy with respect to the target one for effective exploration. Additionally, an analogous critic pair is introduced to incorporate intrinsic rewards in a principled manner, with theoretical guarantees on the overall learning stability and effectiveness. We empirically evaluate environment-reward-only ADAC on 14 continuous-control tasks and report the state-of-the-art on 10 of them. We further demonstrate ADAC, when paired with intrinsic rewards, outperform alternatives in exploration-challenging tasks.",0
"The focus of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is to acquire a rewarding policy by implementing a different policy that collects experience samples.

However, naive disentanglement can result in ineffective learning or instability issues. To address this, our proposed method, Analogous Disentangled Actor-Critic (ADAC), creates analogous pairs of actors and critics. ADAC constrains the expressive behavior policy using Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) for effective exploration and introduces an analogous critic pair to include intrinsic rewards.

"Deep learning has become an increasingly common technique for various control problems, such as robotic arm manipulation, robot navigation, and autonomous vehicles. However, the downside of using deep neural networks to learn control policies is their opaque nature and the difficulties of validating their safety. As the networks used to obtain state-of-the-art results become increasingly deep and complex, the rules they have learned and how they operate become more challenging to understand. This presents an issue, since in safety-critical applications the safety of the control policy must be ensured to a high confidence level. In this paper, we propose an automated black box testing framework based on adversarial reinforcement learning. The technique uses an adversarial agent, whose goal is to degrade the performance of the target model under test. We test the approach on an autonomous vehicle problem, by training an adversarial reinforcement learning agent, which aims to cause a deep neural network-driven autonomous vehicle to collide. Two neural networks trained for autonomous driving are compared, and the results from the testing are used to compare the robustness of their learned control policies. We show that the proposed framework is able to find weaknesses in both control policies that were not evident during online testing and therefore, demonstrate a significant benefit over manual testing methods.",0

"This work exploits action equivariance for representation learning in reinforcement learning. Equivariance under actions states that transitions in the input space are mirrored by equivalent transitions in latent space, while the map and transition functions should also commute. We introduce a contrastive loss function that enforces action equivariance on the learned representations. We prove that when our loss is zero, we have a homomorphism of a deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP). Learning equivariant maps leads to structured latent spaces, allowing us to build a model on which we plan through value iteration. We show experimentally that for deterministic MDPs, the optimal policy in the abstract MDP can be successfully lifted to the original MDP. Moreover, the approach easily adapts to changes in the goal states. Empirically, we show that in such MDPs, we obtain better representations in fewer epochs compared to representation learning approaches using reconstructions, while generalizing better to new goals than model-free approaches.",0

"Molecular graph generation is a fundamental problem for drug discovery and has been attracting growing attention. The problem is challenging since it requires not only generating chemically valid molecular structures but also optimizing their chemical properties in the meantime. Inspired by the recent progress in deep generative models, in this paper we propose a flow-based autoregressive model for graph generation called GraphAF. GraphAF combines the advantages of both autoregressive and flow-based approaches and enjoys: (1) high model flexibility for data density estimation; (2) efficient parallel computation for training; (3) an iterative sampling process, which allows leveraging chemical domain knowledge for valency checking. Experimental results show that GraphAF is able to generate 68% chemically valid molecules even without chemical knowledge rules and 100% valid molecules with chemical rules. The training process of GraphAF is two times faster than the existing state-of-the-art approach GCPN. After fine-tuning the model for goal-directed property optimization with reinforcement learning, GraphAF achieves state-of-the-art performance on both chemical property optimization and constrained property optimization.",0

"For a robotic grasping task in which diverse unseen target objects exist in a cluttered environment, some deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art results using visual input directly. In contrast, actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically perform very poorly when grasping diverse objects, especially when learning from raw images and sparse rewards. To make these RL techniques feasible for vision-based grasping tasks, we employ state representation learning (SRL), where we encode essential information first for subsequent use in RL. However, typical representation learning procedures are unsuitable for extracting pertinent information for learning the grasping skill, because the visual inputs for representation learning, where a robot attempts to grasp a target object in clutter, are extremely complex. We found that preprocessing based on the disentanglement of a raw input image is the key to effectively capturing a compact representation. This enables deep RL to learn robotic grasping skills from highly varied and diverse visual inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with varying levels of disentanglement in a realistic simulated environment.",0

"Many reinforcement learning algorithms use value functions to guide the search for better policies. These methods estimate the value of a single policy while generalizing across many states. The core idea of this paper is to flip this convention and estimate the value of many policies, for a single set of states. This approach opens up the possibility of performing direct gradient ascent in policy space without seeing any new data. The main challenge for this approach is finding a way to represent complex policies that facilitates learning and generalization. To address this problem, we introduce a scalable, differentiable fingerprinting mechanism that retains essential policy information in a concise embedding.

"Signalized intersections are managed by controllers that assign right of way (green, yellow, and red lights) to non-conflicting directions. Optimizing the actuation policy of such controllers is expected to alleviate traffic congestion and its adverse impact. Given such a safety-critical domain, the affiliated actuation policy is required to be interpretable in a way that can be understood and regulated by a human. This paper presents and analyzes several on-line optimization techniques for tuning interpretable control functions. Although these techniques are defined in a general way, this paper assumes a specific class of interpretable control functions (polynomial functions) for analysis purposes. We show that such an interpretable policy function can be as effective as a deep neural network for approximating an optimized signal actuation policy. We present empirical evidence that supports the use of value-based reinforcement learning for on-line training of the control function. Specifically, we present and study three variants of the Deep Q-learning algorithm that allow the training of an interpretable policy function. Our Deep Regulatable Hardmax Q-learning variant is shown to be particularly effective in optimizing our interpretable actuation policy, resulting in up to 19.4% reduced vehicles delay compared to commonly deployed actuated signal controllers.",0

"One of the key reasons for the high sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL) is the inability to transfer knowledge from one task to another. In standard multi-task RL settings, low-reward data collected while trying to solve one task provides little to no signal for solving that particular task and is hence effectively wasted. However, we argue that this data, which is uninformative for one task, is likely a rich source of information for other tasks. To leverage this insight and efficiently reuse data, we present Generalized Hindsight: an approximate inverse reinforcement learning technique for relabeling behaviors with the right tasks. Intuitively, given a behavior generated under one task, Generalized Hindsight returns a different task that the behavior is better suited for. Then, the behavior is relabeled with this new task before being used by an off-policy RL optimizer. Compared to standard relabeling techniques, Generalized Hindsight provides a substantially more efficient reuse of samples, which we empirically demonstrate on a suite of multi-task navigation and manipulation tasks. Videos and code can be accessed here: https://sites.google.com/view/generalized-hindsight.",0

"Optimistic initialisation is an effective strategy for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). In the tabular case, all provably efficient model-free algorithms rely on it. However, model-free deep RL algorithms do not use optimistic initialisation despite taking inspiration from these provably efficient tabular algorithms. In particular, in scenarios with only positive rewards, Q-values are initialised at their lowest possible values due to commonly used network initialisation schemes, a pessimistic initialisation. Merely initialising the network to output optimistic Q-values is not enough, since we cannot ensure that they remain optimistic for novel state-action pairs, which is crucial for exploration. We propose a simple count-based augmentation to pessimistically initialised Q-values that separates the source of optimism from the neural network. We show that this scheme is provably efficient in the tabular setting and extend it to the deep RL setting. Our algorithm, Optimistic Pessimistically Initialised Q-Learning (OPIQ), augments the Q-value estimates of a DQN-based agent with count-derived bonuses to ensure optimism during both action selection and bootstrapping. We show that OPIQ outperforms non-optimistic DQN variants that utilise a pseudocount-based intrinsic motivation in hard exploration tasks, and that it predicts optimistic estimates for novel state-action pairs.",0

"This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to enable safe and efficient autonomous navigation in unknown partially observable environments. The objective is to infer a cost function that explains expert-demonstrated navigation behavior while relying only on the observations and state-control trajectory used by the expert. We develop a cost function representation composed of two parts: a probabilistic occupancy encoder, with recurrent dependence on the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined over the occupancy features. The representation parameters are optimized by differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost encoder. Such differentiation is typically computed by dynamic programming through the value function over the whole state space. We observe that this is inefficient in large partially observable environments because most states are unexplored. Instead, we rely on a closed-form subgradient of the cost-to-go obtained only over a subset of promising states via an efficient motion-planning algorithm such as A* or RRT. Our experiments show that our model exceeds the accuracy of baseline IRL algorithms in robot navigation tasks, while substantially improving the efficiency of training and test-time inference.",0

"Policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms form the basis of many commonly used training techniques in deep reinforcement learning. Using these algorithms in multiagent environments poses problems such as nonstationarity and instability. In this paper, we first demonstrate that standard softmax-based policy gradient can be prone to poor performance in the presence of even the most benign nonstationarity. By contrast, it is known that the replicator dynamics, a well-studied model from evolutionary game theory, eliminates dominated strategies and exhibits convergence of the time-averaged trajectories to interior Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. Thus, using the replicator dynamics as a foundation, we derive an elegant one-line change to policy gradient methods that simply bypasses the gradient step through the softmax, yielding a new algorithm titled Neural Replicator Dynamics (NeuRD). NeuRD reduces to the exponential weights/Hedge algorithm in the single-state all-actions case. Additionally, NeuRD has formal equivalence to softmax counterfactual regret minimization, which guarantees convergence in the sequential tabular case. Importantly, our algorithm provides a straightforward way of extending the replicator dynamics to the function approximation setting. Empirical results show that NeuRD quickly adapts to nonstationarities, outperforming policy gradient significantly in both tabular and function approximation settings, when evaluated on the standard imperfect information benchmarks of Kuhn Poker, Leduc Poker, and Goofspiel.",0

"Thompson Sampling is a well established approach to bandit and reinforcement learning problems. However its use in continuum armed bandit problems has received relatively little attention. We provide the first bounds on the regret of Thompson Sampling for continuum armed bandits under weak conditions on the function class containing the true function and sub-exponential observation noise. Our bounds are realised by analysis of the eluder dimension, a recently proposed measure of the complexity of a function class, which has been demonstrated to be useful in bounding the Bayesian regret of Thompson Sampling for simpler bandit problems under sub-Gaussian observation noise. We derive a new bound on the eluder dimension for classes of functions with Lipschitz derivatives, and generalise previous analyses in multiple regards.",0

"Practitioners often rely on compute-intensive domain randomization to ensure reinforcement learning policies trained in simulation can robustly transfer to the real world. Due to unmodeled nonlinearities in the real system, however, even such simulated policies can still fail to perform stably enough to acquire experience in real environments. In this paper we propose a novel method that guarantees a stable region of attraction for the output of a policy trained in simulation, even for highly nonlinear systems. Our core technique is to use ""bias-shifted"" neural networks for constructing the controller and training the network in the simulator. The modified neural networks not only capture the nonlinearities of the system but also provably preserve linearity in a certain region of the state space and thus can be tuned to resemble a linear quadratic regulator that is known to be stable for the real system. We have tested our new method by transferring simulated policies for a swing-up inverted pendulum to real systems and demonstrated its efficacy.",0

"The lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that over-parameterization of deep neural networks (DNNs) aids training by increasing the probability of a ""lucky"" sub-network initialization being present rather than by helping the optimization process (Frankle & Carbin, 2019). Intriguingly, this phenomenon suggests that initialization strategies for DNNs can be improved substantially, but the lottery ticket hypothesis has only previously been tested in the context of supervised learning for natural image tasks. Here, we evaluate whether ""winning ticket"" initializations exist in two different domains: natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL).For NLP, we examined both recurrent LSTM models and large-scale Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). For RL, we analyzed a number of discrete-action space tasks, including both classic control and pixel control. Consistent with workin supervised image classification, we confirm that winning ticket initializations generally outperform parameter-matched random initializations, even at extreme pruning rates for both NLP and RL. Notably, we are able to find winning ticket initializations for Transformers which enable models one-third the size to achieve nearly equivalent performance. Together, these results suggest that the lottery ticket hypothesis is not restricted to supervised learning of natural images, but rather represents a broader phenomenon in DNNs.",0

"Multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) aims to simultaneously learn policies for solving many tasks. Several prior works have found that relabeling past experience with different reward functions can improve sample efficiency. Relabeling methods typically ask: if, in hindsight, we assume that our experience was optimal for some task, for what task was it optimal? In this paper, we show that hindsight relabeling is inverse RL, an observation that suggests that we can use inverse RL in tandem for RL algorithms to efficiently solve many tasks. We use this idea to generalize goal-relabeling techniques from prior work to arbitrary classes of tasks. Our experiments confirm that relabeling data using inverse RL accelerates learning in general multi-task settings, including goal-reaching, domains with discrete sets of rewards, and those with linear reward functions.",0

Previous studies have concluded that changing the reward function in past experiences can enhance the efficiency of the learning process. Typically, this involves asking which task the experience was optimal for, assuming it was optimal for a particular task in hindsight. In this study, we propose that hindsight relabeling is a form of inverse RL, which can be used in conjunction with RL algorithms to efficiently solve multiple tasks. We apply this concept to generalize goal-relabeling methods for various classes of tasks. Our experiments show that using inverse RL to relabel data speeds up the learning process in general multi-task settings, including those with goal-reaching, discrete rewards, and linear reward functions.",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning is known to be memory and computation efficient and more amendable to large scale problems. In this paper, two model-free algorithms are introduced for learning infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The first algorithm reduces the problem to the discounted-reward version and achieves $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret after $T$ steps, under the minimal assumption of weakly communicating MDPs. To our knowledge, this is the first model-free algorithm for general MDPs in this setting. The second algorithm makes use of recent advances in adaptive algorithms for adversarial multi-armed bandits and improves the regret to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, albeit with a stronger ergodic assumption. This result significantly improves over the $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret achieved by the only existing model-free algorithm by Abbasi-Yadkori et al.

"The success of deep neural networks relies on significant architecture engineering. Recently neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promise to greatly reduce manual effort in network design by automatically searching for optimal architectures, although typically such algorithms need an excessive amount of computational resources, e.g., a few thousand GPU-days. To date, on challenging vision tasks such as object detection, NAS, especially fast versions of NAS, is less studied. Here we propose to search for the decoder structure of object detectors with search efficiency being taken into consideration.

"In this paper, we propose a derivative-free model learning framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). In many mechanical systems, only positions can be measured by the sensing instruments. Then, instead of representing the system state as suggested by the physics with a collection of positions, velocities, and accelerations, we define the state as the set of past position measurements. However, the equation of motions derived by physical first principles cannot be directly applied in this framework, being functions of velocities and accelerations. For this reason, we introduce a novel derivative-free physically-inspired kernel, which can be easily combined with nonparametric derivative-free Gaussian Process models. Tests performed on two real platforms show that the considered state definition combined with the proposed model improves estimation performance and data-efficiency w.r.t. traditional models based on GPR. Finally, we validate the proposed framework by solving two RL control problems for two real robotic systems.",0

We identify sufficient conditions for convergence and correctness for such an approach. For a concrete instance of EIS where random policy is used for ""exploration"", Monte-Carlo Tree Search is used for ""policy improvement"" and Nearest Neighbors is used for ""supervised learning"", we establish that this method finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate value function of Nash equilibrium in $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-(d+4)})$ steps when the underlying state-space of the game is continuous and $d$-dimensional.

"Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a popular method for the sample-efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. However, the application to high-dimensional problems with several thousand observations remains challenging, and on difficult problems Bayesian optimization is often not competitive with other paradigms. In this paper we take the view that this is due to the implicit homogeneity of the global probabilistic models and an overemphasized exploration that results from global acquisition. This motivates the design of a local probabilistic approach for global optimization of large-scale high-dimensional problems. We propose the $\texttt{TuRBO}$ algorithm that fits a collection of local models and performs a principled global allocation of samples across these models via an implicit bandit approach. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that $\texttt{TuRBO}$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods from machine learning and operations research on problems spanning reinforcement learning, robotics, and the natural sciences.",0

"Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms make decisions by building and utilizing a model of the environment. However, none of the existing algorithms attempts to infer the dynamics of any state-action pair from known state-action pairs before meeting it for sufficient times. We propose a new model-based method called Greedy Inference Model (GIM) that infers the unknown dynamics from known dynamics based on the internal spectral properties of the environment. In other words, GIM can ""learn by analogy"". We further introduce a new exploration strategy which ensures that the agent rapidly and evenly visits unknown state-action pairs. GIM is much more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art model-based algorithms, as the number of dynamic programming operations is independent of the environment size. Lower sample complexity could also be achieved under mild conditions compared against methods without inferring. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GIM in a variety of real-world tasks.",0

"Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful, general tool for learning complex behaviors. However, its sample efficiency is often impractically large for solving challenging real-world problems, even with off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic model-free RL is that the learning signal consists only of scalar rewards, ignoring much of the rich information contained in state transition tuples. Model-based RL uses this information, by training a predictive model, but often does not achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL due to model bias. We introduce temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of goal-conditioned value functions that can be trained with model-free learning and used for model-based control. TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and model-based RL: they leverage the rich information in state transitions to learn very efficiently, while still attaining asymptotic performance that exceeds that of direct model-based RL methods. Our experimental results show that, on a range of continuous control tasks, TDMs provide a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods.",0

"Despite the great empirical success of deep reinforcement learning, its theoretical foundation is less well understood. In this work, we make the first attempt to theoretically understand the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm (Mnih et al., 2015) from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. In specific, we focus on a slight simplification of DQN that fully captures its key features. Under mild assumptions, we establish the algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence for the action-value functions of the iterative policy sequence obtained by DQN. In particular, the statistical error characterizes the bias and variance that arise from approximating the action-value function using deep neural network, while the algorithmic error converges to zero at a geometric rate. As a byproduct, our analysis provides justifications for the techniques of experience replay and target network, which are crucial to the empirical success of DQN. Furthermore, as a simple extension of DQN, we propose the Minimax-DQN algorithm for zero-sum Markov game with two players.

"In this paper, we consider the source of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)'s sample complexity, asking how much derives from the requirement of learning useful representations of environment states and how much is due to the sample complexity of learning a policy. While for DRL agents, the distinction between representation and policy may not be clear, we seek new insight through a set of transfer learning experiments. In each experiment, we retain some fraction of layers trained on either the same game or a related game, comparing the benefits of transfer learning to learning a policy from scratch. Interestingly, we find that benefits due to transfer are highly variable in general and non-symmetric across pairs of tasks. Our experiments suggest that perhaps transfer from simpler environments can boost performance on more complex downstream tasks and that the requirements of learning a useful representation can range from negligible to the majority of the sample complexity, based on the environment. Furthermore, we find that fine-tuning generally outperforms training with the transferred layers frozen, confirming an insight first noted in the classification setting.",0

"In mobile health (mHealth), reinforcement learning algorithms that adapt to one's context without learning personalized policies might fail to distinguish between the needs of individuals. Yet the high amount of noise due to the in situ delivery of mHealth interventions can cripple the ability of an algorithm to learn when given access to only a single user's data, making personalization challenging. We present IntelligentPooling, which learns personalized policies via an adaptive, principled use of other users' data.

"Deep reinforcement learning is successful in decision making for sophisticated games, such as Atari, Go, etc. However, real-world decision making often requires reasoning with partial information extracted from complex visual observations. This paper presents Discriminative Particle Filter Reinforcement Learning (DPFRL), a new reinforcement learning framework for complex partial observations. DPFRL encodes a differentiable particle filter in the neural network policy for explicit reasoning with partial observations over time. The particle filter maintains a belief using learned discriminative update, which is trained end-to-end for decision making. We show that using the discriminative update instead of standard generative models results in significantly improved performance, especially for tasks with complex visual observations, because they circumvent the difficulty of modeling complex observations that are irrelevant to decision making. In addition, to extract features from the particle belief, we propose a new type of belief feature based on the moment generating function. DPFRL outperforms state-of-the-art POMDP RL models in Flickering Atari Games, an existing POMDP RL benchmark, and in Natural Flickering Atari Games, a new, more challenging POMDP RL benchmark introduced in this paper. Further, DPFRL performs well for visual navigation with real-world data in the Habitat environment.",0

"Stochastic shortest path (SSP) is a well-known problem in planning and control, in which an agent has to reach a goal state in minimum total expected cost. In the learning formulation of the problem, the agent is unaware of the environment dynamics (i.e., the transition function) and has to repeatedly play for a given number of episodes while reasoning about the problem's optimal solution. Unlike other well-studied models in reinforcement learning (RL), the length of an episode is not predetermined (or bounded) and is influenced by the agent's actions. Recently, Tarbouriech et al. (2019) studied this problem in the context of regret minimization and provided an algorithm whose regret bound is inversely proportional to the square root of the minimum instantaneous cost. In this work we remove this dependence on the minimum cost---we give an algorithm that guarantees a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(B_\star |S| \sqrt{|A| K})$, where $B_\star$ is an upper bound on the expected cost of the optimal policy, $S$ is the set of states, $A$ is the set of actions and $K$ is the number of episodes.

"We propose a targeted communication architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents learn both what messages to send and whom to address them to while performing cooperative tasks in partially-observable environments. This targeting behavior is learnt solely from downstream task-specific reward without any communication supervision. We additionally augment this with a multi-round communication approach where agents coordinate via multiple rounds of communication before taking actions in the environment. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of cooperative multi-agent tasks, of varying difficulties, with varying number of agents, in a variety of environments ranging from 2D grid layouts of shapes and simulated traffic junctions to 3D indoor environments, and demonstrate the benefits of targeted and multi-round communication. Moreover, we show that the targeted communication strategies learned by agents are interpretable and intuitive. Finally, we show that our architecture can be easily extended to mixed and competitive environments, leading to improved performance and sample complexity over recent state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"Our proposed communication architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning involves agents learning how to effectively communicate with each other while working together on tasks in environments that are partially observable. This behavior is learned solely based on the rewards received from completing the task, without any supervision. We also incorporate a multi-round communication approach where agents communicate multiple times before taking action. We test our approach on various cooperative multi-agent tasks in different environments and show the advantages of targeted and multi-round communication. Additionally, we demonstrate that the communication strategies learned by the agents are understandable and logical. Finally, we extend our architecture to mixed and competitive environments, resulting in improved performance and less need for samples compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Inspired by the adaptation phenomenon of neuronal firing, we propose the regularity normalization (RN) as an unsupervised attention mechanism (UAM) which computes the statistical regularity in the implicit space of neural networks under the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Treating the neural network optimization process as a partially observable model selection problem, UAM constrains the implicit space by a normalization factor, the universal code length. We compute this universal code incrementally across neural network layers and demonstrated the flexibility to include data priors such as top-down attention and other oracle information. Empirically, our approach outperforms existing normalization methods in tackling limited, imbalanced and non-stationary input distribution in image classification, classic control, procedurally-generated reinforcement learning, generative modeling, handwriting generation and question answering tasks with various neural network architectures. Lastly, UAM tracks dependency and critical learning stages across layers and recurrent time steps of deep networks.",0

"This paper studies the statistical theory of batch data reinforcement learning with function approximation. Consider the off-policy evaluation problem, which is to estimate the cumulative value of a new target policy from logged history generated by unknown behavioral policies. We study a regression-based fitted Q iteration method, and show that it is equivalent to a model-based method that estimates a conditional mean embedding of the transition operator. We prove that this method is information-theoretically optimal and has nearly minimal estimation error. In particular, by leveraging contraction property of Markov processes and martingale concentration, we establish a finite-sample instance-dependent error upper bound and a nearly-matching minimax lower bound. The policy evaluation error depends sharply on a restricted $\chi^2$-divergence over the function class between the long-term distribution of the target policy and the distribution of past data. This restricted $\chi^2$-divergence is both instance-dependent and function-class-dependent. It characterizes the statistical limit of off-policy evaluation. Further, we provide an easily computable confidence bound for the policy evaluator, which may be useful for optimistic planning and safe policy improvement.",0
"The focus of this paper is on the statistical principles behind batch data reinforcement learning with function approximation. Specifically, we address the challenge of estimating the cumulative value of a new target policy based on previously recorded data from unknown behavioral policies.

The key factor in determining the policy evaluation error is the restricted $\chi^2$-divergence between the long-term distribution of the target policy and the distribution of past data. This divergence is both instance and function-class dependent, and is critical to understanding the statistical limits of off-policy evaluation. Finally, we provide a practical confidence bound for the policy evaluator, which can be useful for optimistic planning and safe policy improvement.",1
"In order to drive safely and efficiently under merging scenarios, autonomous vehicles should be aware of their surroundings and make decisions by interacting with other road participants. Moreover, different strategies should be made when the autonomous vehicle is interacting with drivers having different level of cooperativeness. Whether the vehicle is on the merge-lane or main-lane will also influence the driving maneuvers since drivers will behave differently when they have the right-of-way than otherwise. Many traditional methods have been proposed to solve decision making problems under merging scenarios. However, these works either are incapable of modeling complicated interactions or require implementing hand-designed rules which cannot properly handle the uncertainties in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we proposed an interaction-aware decision making with adaptive strategies (IDAS) approach that can let the autonomous vehicle negotiate the road with other drivers by leveraging their cooperativeness under merging scenarios. A single policy is learned under the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting via the curriculum learning strategy, which enables the agent to automatically infer other drivers' various behaviors and make decisions strategically. A masking mechanism is also proposed to prevent the agent from exploring states that violate common sense of human judgment and increase the learning efficiency. An exemplar merging scenario was used to implement and examine the proposed method.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) in discrete action space is ubiquitous in real-world applications, but its complexity grows exponentially with the action-space dimension, making it challenging to apply existing on-policy gradient based deep RL algorithms efficiently. To effectively operate in multidimensional discrete action spaces, we construct a critic to estimate action-value functions, apply it on correlated actions, and combine these critic estimated action values to control the variance of gradient estimation. We follow rigorous statistical analysis to design how to generate and combine these correlated actions, and how to sparsify the gradients by shutting down the contributions from certain dimensions. These efforts result in a new discrete action on-policy RL algorithm that empirically outperforms related on-policy algorithms relying on variance control techniques. We demonstrate these properties on OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks, and illustrate how discretizing the action space could benefit the exploration phase and hence facilitate convergence to a better local optimal solution thanks to the flexibility of discrete policy.",0

"Parameter-transfer is a well-known and versatile approach for meta-learning, with applications including few-shot learning, federated learning, and reinforcement learning. However, parameter-transfer algorithms often require sharing models that have been trained on the samples from specific tasks, thus leaving the task-owners susceptible to breaches of privacy. We conduct the first formal study of privacy in this setting and formalize the notion of task-global differential privacy as a practical relaxation of more commonly studied threat models. We then propose a new differentially private algorithm for gradient-based parameter transfer that not only satisfies this privacy requirement but also retains provable transfer learning guarantees in convex settings. Empirically, we apply our analysis to the problems of federated learning with personalization and few-shot classification, showing that allowing the relaxation to task-global privacy from the more commonly studied notion of local privacy leads to dramatically increased performance in recurrent neural language modeling and image classification.",0

"In many vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the agent controls a movable object in its visual field, e.g., the player's avatar in video games and the robotic arm in visual grasping and manipulation. Leveraging action-conditioned video prediction, we propose an end-to-end learning framework to disentangle the controllable object from the observation signal. The disentangled representation is shown to be useful for RL as additional observation channels to the agent. Experiments on a set of Atari games with the popular Double DQN algorithm demonstrate improved sample efficiency and game performance (from 222.8% to 261.4% measured in normalized game scores, with prediction bonus reward).",0

"Evolution strategy (ES) has been shown great promise in many challenging reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, rivaling other state-of-the-art deep RL methods. Yet, there are two limitations in the current ES practice that may hinder its otherwise further capabilities. First, most current methods rely on Monte Carlo type gradient estimators to suggest search direction, where the policy parameter is, in general, randomly sampled. Due to the low accuracy of such estimators, the RL training may suffer from slow convergence and require more iterations to reach optimal solution. Secondly, the landscape of reward functions can be deceptive and contains many local maxima, causing ES algorithms to prematurely converge and be unable to explore other parts of the parameter space with potentially greater rewards. In this work, we employ a Directional Gaussian Smoothing Evolutionary Strategy (DGS-ES) to accelerate RL training, which is well-suited to address these two challenges with its ability to i) provide gradient estimates with high accuracy, and ii) find nonlocal search direction which lays stress on large-scale variation of the reward function and disregards local fluctuation. Through several benchmark RL tasks demonstrated herein, we show that DGS-ES is highly scalable, possesses superior wall-clock time, and achieves competitive reward scores to other popular policy gradient and ES approaches.",0

"An important problem that arises in reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo methods is estimating quantities defined by the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. In many real-world applications, access to the underlying transition operator is limited to a fixed set of data that has already been collected, without additional interaction with the environment being available. We show that consistent estimation remains possible in this challenging scenario, and that effective estimation can still be achieved in important applications. Our approach is based on estimating a ratio that corrects for the discrepancy between the stationary and empirical distributions, derived from fundamental properties of the stationary distribution, and exploiting constraint reformulations based on variational divergence minimization. The resulting algorithm, GenDICE, is straightforward and effective. We prove its consistency under general conditions, provide an error analysis, and demonstrate strong empirical performance on benchmark problems, including off-line PageRank and off-policy policy evaluation.",0

"Explicit engineering of reward functions for given environments has been a major hindrance to reinforcement learning methods. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a solution to recover reward functions from demonstrations only, these learned rewards are generally heavily \textit{entangled} with the dynamics of the environment and therefore not portable or \emph{robust} to changing environments. Modern adversarial methods have yielded some success in reducing reward entanglement in the IRL setting. In this work, we leverage one such method, Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL), to propose an algorithm that learns hierarchical disentangled rewards with a policy over options. We show that this method has the ability to learn \emph{generalizable} policies and reward functions in complex transfer learning tasks, while yielding results in continuous control benchmarks that are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Saliency maps are frequently used to support explanations of the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. However, a review of how saliency maps are used in practice indicates that the derived explanations are often unfalsifiable and can be highly subjective.

We use Atari games, a common benchmark for deep RL, to evaluate three types of saliency maps. Our results show the extent to which existing claims about Atari games can be evaluated and suggest that saliency maps are best viewed as an exploratory tool rather than an explanatory tool.",0

"Recent deep neural networks based techniques, especially those equipped with the ability of self-adaptation in the system level such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are shown to possess many advantages of optimizing robot learning systems (e.g., autonomous navigation and continuous robot arm control.) However, the learning-based systems and the associated models may be threatened by the risks of intentionally adaptive (e.g., noisy sensor confusion) and adversarial perturbations from real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce timing-based adversarial strategies against a DRL-based navigation system by jamming in physical noise patterns on the selected time frames. To study the vulnerability of learning-based navigation systems, we propose two adversarial agent models: one refers to online learning; another one is based on evolutionary learning. Besides, three open-source robot learning and navigation control environments are employed to study the vulnerability under adversarial timing attacks. Our experimental results show that the adversarial timing attacks can lead to a significant performance drop, and also suggest the necessity of enhancing the robustness of robot learning systems.",0

"We formulate a general framework for competitive gradient-based learning that encompasses a wide breadth of multi-agent learning algorithms, and analyze the limiting behavior of competitive gradient-based learning algorithms using dynamical systems theory. For both general-sum and potential games, we characterize a non-negligible subset of the local Nash equilibria that will be avoided if each agent employs a gradient-based learning algorithm. We also shed light on the issue of convergence to non-Nash strategies in general- and zero-sum games, which may have no relevance to the underlying game, and arise solely due to the choice of algorithm. The existence and frequency of such strategies may explain some of the difficulties encountered when using gradient descent in zero-sum games as, e.g., in the training of generative adversarial networks. To reinforce the theoretical contributions, we provide empirical results that highlight the frequency of linear quadratic dynamic games (a benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning) that admit global Nash equilibria that are almost surely avoided by policy gradient.",0

We propose a meta-algorithm that achieves the lower bound without any parametric assumptions and exhibits a unique 3-way double robustness property.

"We propose a Reinforcement Learning based approach to approximately solve the Tree Decomposition (TD) problem. TD is a combinatorial problem, which is central to the analysis of graph minor structure and computational complexity, as well as in the algorithms of probabilistic inference, register allocation, and other practical tasks. Recently, it has been shown that combinatorial problems can be successively solved by learned heuristics. However, the majority of existing works do not address the question of the generalization of learning-based solutions. Our model is based on the graph convolution neural network (GCN) for learning graph representations. We show that the agent builton GCN and trained on a single graph using an Actor-Critic method can efficiently generalize to real-world TD problem instances. We establish that our method successfully generalizes from small graphs, where TD can be found by exact algorithms, to large instances of practical interest, while still having very low time-to-solution. On the other hand, the agent-based approach surpasses all greedy heuristics by the quality of the solution.",0

"Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn effective policies for complex tasks, such as Atari games, even from image observations. However, this typically requires very large amounts of interaction -- substantially more, in fact, than a human would need to learn the same games. How can people learn so quickly? Part of the answer may be that people can learn how the game works and predict which actions will lead to desirable outcomes. In this paper, we explore how video prediction models can similarly enable agents to solve Atari games with fewer interactions than model-free methods. We describe Simulated Policy Learning (SimPLe), a complete model-based deep RL algorithm based on video prediction models and present a comparison of several model architectures, including a novel architecture that yields the best results in our setting. Our experiments evaluate SimPLe on a range of Atari games in low data regime of 100k interactions between the agent and the environment, which corresponds to two hours of real-time play. In most games SimPLe outperforms state-of-the-art model-free algorithms, in some games by over an order of magnitude.",0

"Text-based games -- in which an agent interacts with the world through textual natural language -- present us with the problem of combinatorially-sized action-spaces. Most current reinforcement learning algorithms are not capable of effectively handling such a large number of possible actions per turn. Poor sample efficiency, consequently, results in agents that are unable to pass bottleneck states, where they are unable to proceed because they do not see the right action sequence to pass the bottleneck enough times to be sufficiently reinforced. Building on prior work using knowledge graphs in reinforcement learning, we introduce two new game state exploration strategies. We compare our exploration strategies against strong baselines on the classic text-adventure game, Zork1, where prior agent have been unable to get past a bottleneck where the agent is eaten by a Grue.",0

"The construction by Du et al. (2019) implies that even if a learner is given linear features in $\mathbb R^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit with a uniform error of $\epsilon$, then searching for an action that is optimal up to $O(\epsilon)$ requires examining essentially all actions. We use the Kiefer-Wolfowitz theorem to prove a positive result that by checking only a few actions, a learner can always find an action that is suboptimal with an error of at most $O(\epsilon \sqrt{d})$. Thus, features are useful when the approximation error is small relative to the dimensionality of the features. The idea is applied to stochastic bandits and reinforcement learning with a generative model where the learner has access to $d$-dimensional linear features that approximate the action-value functions for all policies to an accuracy of $\epsilon$. For linear bandits, we prove a bound on the regret of order $\sqrt{dn \log(k)} + \epsilon n \sqrt{d} \log(n)$ with $k$ the number of actions and $n$ the horizon. For RL we show that approximate policy iteration can learn a policy that is optimal up to an additive error of order $\epsilon \sqrt{d}/(1 - \gamma)^2$ and using $d/(\epsilon^2(1 - \gamma)^4)$ samples from a generative model. These bounds are independent of the finer details of the features. We also investigate how the structure of the feature set impacts the tradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error.",0

"We establish that an optimistic variant of Q-learning applied to a fixed-horizon episodic Markov decision process with an aggregated state representation incurs regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{H^5 M K} + \epsilon HK)$, where $H$ is the horizon, $M$ is the number of aggregate states, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $\epsilon$ is the largest difference between any pair of optimal state-action values associated with a common aggregate state. Notably, this regret bound does not depend on the number of states or actions and indicates that asymptotic per-period regret is no greater than $\epsilon$, independent of horizon. To our knowledge, this is the first such result that applies to reinforcement learning with nontrivial value function approximation without any restrictions on transition probabilities.",0
"It has been determined that utilizing an optimistic variation of Q-learning on a Markov decision process with an aggregated state representation that has a fixed-horizon and is episodic, results in regret of approximately $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{H^5 M K} + \epsilon HK)$. The horizon is denoted by $H$, the number of aggregate states by $M$, the number of episodes by $K$, and $\epsilon$ represents the largest disparity between optimal state-action values that are associated with a shared aggregate state. It is significant to note that this regret boundary is not dependent on the quantity of states or actions, and it implies that the per-period regret in the asymptotic is not greater than $\epsilon”, regardless of the horizon.

"Data-driven methods have made great progress in fault diagnosis, especially deep learning method. Deep learning is suitable for processing big data, and has a strong feature extraction ability to realize end-to-end fault diagnosis systems.

"Significant advancements in fault diagnosis have been achieved through data-driven approaches, particularly utilizing deep learning methods. The strength of deep learning lies in its ability to handle large data sets and perform feature extraction, enabling the development of end-to-end fault diagnosis systems. However, creating neural network architecture requires extensive professional knowledge and debugging experience, and the process of screening models and hyperparameters through experimentation adds to the complexity of developing deep learning models. Fortunately, neural architecture search (NAS) is a rapidly developing field and is seen as the next step in deep learning. In this study, a NAS method for fault diagnosis using reinforcement learning is proposed. A recurrent neural network serves as an agent to generate network architecture, with the accuracy of the generated network on the validation dataset serving as a reward. The agent's parameters are updated through the strategy gradient algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated using the PHM 2009 Data Challenge gearbox dataset, with the resulting state-of-the-art results compared to other artificially designed network structures. This study marks the first known application of NAS in fault diagnosis.",1
"Gradient-based meta-learners such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) have shown strong few-shot performance in supervised and reinforcement learning settings. However, specifically in the case of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL), we can show that gradient-based meta-learners are sensitive to task distributions. With the wrong curriculum, agents suffer the effects of meta-overfitting, shallow adaptation, and adaptation instability. In this work, we begin by highlighting intriguing failure cases of gradient-based meta-RL and show that task distributions can wildly affect algorithmic outputs, stability, and performance. To address this problem, we leverage insights from recent literature on domain randomization and propose meta Active Domain Randomization (meta-ADR), which learns a curriculum of tasks for gradient-based meta-RL in a similar as ADR does for sim2real transfer. We show that this approach induces more stable policies on a variety of simulated locomotion and navigation tasks. We assess in- and out-of-distribution generalization and find that the learned task distributions, even in an unstructured task space, greatly improve the adaptation performance of MAML. Finally, we motivate the need for better benchmarking in meta-RL that prioritizes \textit{generalization} over single-task adaption performance.",0
"Gradient-based meta-learning techniques, including Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), have achieved impressive few-shot performance in supervised and reinforcement learning contexts. However, when it comes to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL), these methods can be vulnerable to variations in task distributions, leading to issues such as meta-overfitting, shallow adaptation, and adaptation instability. This paper highlights cases where gradient-based meta-RL fails and demonstrates how task distributions can have a significant impact on algorithmic outputs, stability, and performance. To address this issue, the authors propose meta Active Domain Randomization (meta-ADR), which uses insights from domain randomization literature to develop a task curriculum for gradient-based meta-RL. They show that this approach leads to more stable policies in a range of simulated locomotion and navigation tasks, and greatly improves the adaptation performance of MAML, even in an unstructured task space. The authors also argue for more comprehensive benchmarking in meta-RL that prioritizes generalization over single-task adaptation performance.",1
"Memory is an important aspect of intelligence and plays a role in many deep reinforcement learning models. However, little progress has been made in understanding when specific memory systems help more than others and how well they generalize. The field also has yet to see a prevalent consistent and rigorous approach for evaluating agent performance on holdout data. In this paper, we aim to develop a comprehensive methodology to test different kinds of memory in an agent and assess how well the agent can apply what it learns in training to a holdout set that differs from the training set along dimensions that we suggest are relevant for evaluating memory-specific generalization. To that end, we first construct a diverse set of memory tasks that allow us to evaluate test-time generalization across multiple dimensions. Second, we develop and perform multiple ablations on an agent architecture that combines multiple memory systems, observe its baseline models, and investigate its performance against the task suite.",0
"The role of memory in intelligence is crucial and has been incorporated into many deep reinforcement learning models. However, there is a lack of progress in comprehending which memory systems are more effective and how well they can generalize. Furthermore, there is no consistent method for evaluating agent performance on holdout data. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology to assess different memory types in agents and their ability to apply what they learn to a holdout set with relevant dimensions for memory-specific generalization. To achieve this, a set of diverse memory tasks is constructed to evaluate test-time generalization across multiple dimensions. Additionally, multiple ablations are performed on an agent architecture that combines several memory systems, and its performance against the task suite is investigated.",1
"We devise and analyze algorithms for the empirical policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning. Our algorithms explore backward from high-cost states to find high-value ones, in contrast to forward approaches that work forward from all states. While several papers have demonstrated the utility of backward exploration empirically, we conduct rigorous analyses which show that our algorithms can reduce average-case sample complexity from $O(S \log S)$ to as low as $O(\log S)$.",0
