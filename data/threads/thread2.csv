"The throughput of electron microscopes has increased significantly in recent years, enabling detailed analysis of cell morphology and ultrastructure. Analysis of neural circuits at single-synapse resolution remains the flagship target of this technique, but applications to cell and developmental biology are also starting to emerge at scale. The amount of data acquired in such studies makes manual instance segmentation, a fundamental step in many analysis pipelines, impossible. While automatic segmentation approaches have improved significantly thanks to the adoption of convolutional neural networks, their accuracy still lags behind human annotations and requires additional manual proof-reading. A major hindrance to further improvements is the limited field of view of the segmentation networks preventing them from exploiting the expected cell morphology or other prior biological knowledge which humans use to inform their segmentation decisions. In this contribution, we show how such domain-specific information can be leveraged by expressing it as long-range interactions in a graph partitioning problem known as the lifted multicut problem. Using this formulation, we demonstrate significant improvement in segmentation accuracy for three challenging EM segmentation problems from neuroscience and cell biology.",0
"In recent years, the speed at which electron microscopes operate has increased considerably, allowing for in-depth examination of cell morphology and ultrastructure. Although the primary aim of this technique remains the analysis of neural circuits at single-synapse resolution, it is now also being used in cell and developmental biology on a larger scale. The volume of data generated in these studies renders manual instance segmentation impractical. Despite improvements in automatic segmentation methods, which employ convolutional neural networks, their accuracy still trails behind that of human annotations and necessitates additional manual verification. The restricted field of view of segmentation networks is a significant barrier to further enhancements since they cannot exploit the anticipated cell morphology or other prior biological knowledge that humans use to inform their segmentation decisions. This article demonstrates how such domain-specific data can be employed by expressing it as long-range interactions in a graph partitioning problem known as the lifted multicut problem. We showcase this formulation's effectiveness by achieving a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy for three challenging EM segmentation issues in neuroscience and cell biology.",1
"We tackle the problem of graph partitioning for image segmentation using correlation clustering (CC), which we treat as an integer linear program (ILP). We reformulate optimization in the ILP so as to admit efficient optimization via Benders decomposition, a classic technique from operations research. Our Benders decomposition formulation has many subproblems, each associated with a node in the CC instance's graph, which are solved in parallel. Each Benders subproblem enforces the cycle inequalities corresponding to the negative weight edges attached to its corresponding node in the CC instance. We generate Magnanti-Wong Benders rows in addition to standard Benders rows, to accelerate optimization. Our Benders decomposition approach provides a promising new avenue to accelerate optimization for CC, and allows for massive parallelization.",0

"Clustering is one of the major roles in data mining that is widely application in pattern recognition and image segmentation. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is the most used clustering algorithm that proven efficient, fast and easy to implement, however, FCM uses the Euclidean distance that often leads to clustering errors, especially when handling multidimensional and noisy data.

"Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware segmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on fluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit transformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class membership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of post-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is error-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and nuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to segment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample preparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that operate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on object detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we propose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training set. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale and segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that three out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34 backbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the sample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation performance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware segmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures.

"We propose a novel semi-supervised image segmentation method that simultaneously optimizes a supervised segmentation and an unsupervised reconstruction objectives. The reconstruction objective uses an attention mechanism that separates the reconstruction of image areas corresponding to different classes. The proposed approach was evaluated on two applications: brain tumor and white matter hyperintensities segmentation. Our method, trained on unlabeled and a small number of labeled images, outperformed supervised CNNs trained with the same number of images and CNNs pre-trained on unlabeled data. In ablation experiments, we observed that the proposed attention mechanism substantially improves segmentation performance. We explore two multi-task training strategies: joint training and alternating training. Alternating training requires fewer hyperparameters and achieves a better, more stable performance than joint training. Finally, we analyze the features learned by different methods and find that the attention mechanism helps to learn more discriminative features in the deeper layers of encoders.",0

"Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under favorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic segmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting daytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we design a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of semantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum framework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via labeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively darker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the real images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel uncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic segmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions beyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion; 3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920 unlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts plus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created with our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel evaluation.

"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are state-of-the-art for semantic image segmentation, but typically require many labeled training samples. Obtaining 3D segmentations of medical images for supervised training is difficult and labor intensive. Motivated by classical approaches for joint segmentation and registration we therefore propose a deep learning framework that jointly learns networks for image registration and image segmentation. In contrast to previous work on deep unsupervised image registration, which showed the benefit of weak supervision via image segmentations, our approach can use existing segmentations when available and computes them via the segmentation network otherwise, thereby providing the same registration benefit. Conversely, segmentation network training benefits from the registration, which essentially provides a realistic form of data augmentation. Experiments on knee and brain 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images show that our approach achieves large simultaneous improvements of segmentation and registration accuracy (over independently trained networks) and allows training high-quality models with very limited training data. Specifically, in a one-shot-scenario (with only one manually labeled image) our approach increases Dice scores (%) over an unsupervised registration network by 2.7 and 1.8 on the knee and brain images respectively.",0

"Segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. However, most existing methods focus on primary region extraction and ignore edge information, which is useful for obtaining accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose a generic medical segmentation method, called Edge-aTtention guidance Network (ET-Net), which embeds edge-attention representations to guide the segmentation network. Specifically, an edge guidance module is utilized to learn the edge-attention representations in the early encoding layers, which are then transferred to the multi-scale decoding layers, fused using a weighted aggregation module. The experimental results on four segmentation tasks (i.e., optic disc/cup and vessel segmentation in retinal images, and lung segmentation in chest X-Ray and CT images) demonstrate that preserving edge-attention representations contributes to the final segmentation accuracy, and our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

"Shape instantiation which predicts the 3D shape of a dynamic target from one or more 2D images is important for real-time intra-operative navigation. Previously, a general shape instantiation framework was proposed with manual image segmentation to generate a 2D Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and with Kernel Partial Least Square Regression (KPLSR) to learn the relationship between the 2D and 3D SSM for 3D shape prediction. In this paper, the two-stage shape instantiation is improved to be one-stage. PointOutNet with 19 convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers is used as the network structure and Chamfer distance is used as the loss function to predict the 3D target point cloud from a single 2D image. With the proposed one-stage shape instantiation algorithm, a spontaneous image-to-point cloud training and inference can be achieved. A dataset from 27 Right Ventricle (RV) subjects, indicating 609 experiments, were used to validate the proposed one-stage shape instantiation algorithm.

"This work addresses the task of open world semantic segmentation using RGBD sensing to discover new semantic classes over time. Although there are many types of objects in the real-word, current semantic segmentation methods make a closed world assumption and are trained only to segment a limited number of object classes. Towards a more open world approach, we propose a novel method that incrementally learns new classes for image segmentation. The proposed system first segments each RGBD frame using both color and geometric information, and then aggregates that information to build a single segmented dense 3D map of the environment. The segmented 3D map representation is a key component of our approach as it is used to discover new object classes by identifying coherent regions in the 3D map that have no semantic label. The use of coherent region in the 3D map as a primitive element, rather than traditional elements such as surfels or voxels, also significantly reduces the computational complexity and memory use of our method. It thus leads to semi-real-time performance at {10.7}Hz when incrementally updating the dense 3D map at every frame. Through experiments on the NYUDv2 dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to correctly cluster objects of both known and unseen classes. We also show the quantitative comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods, the processing time of each step, and the influences of each component.",0

"Semantic Segmentation is an important module for autonomous robots such as self-driving cars. The advantage of video segmentation approaches compared to single image segmentation is that temporal image information is considered, and their performance increases due to this. Hence, single image segmentation approaches are extended by recurrent units such as convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) cells, which are placed at suitable positions in the basic network architecture. However, a major critique of video segmentation approaches based on recurrent neural networks is their large parameter count and their computational complexity, and so, their inference time of one video frame takes up to 66 percent longer than their basic version. Inspired by the success of the spatial and depthwise separable convolutional neural networks, we generalize these techniques for convLSTMs in this work, so that the number of parameters and the required FLOPs are reduced significantly.

This approach reformulates the problem of terrain traversability analysis into two main problems: (1) 3D terrain reconstruction and (2) terrain all surfaces detection and analysis. The proposed approach is using stereo camera for perception and 3D reconstruction of the terrain. In order to detect all the existing surfaces in the 3D reconstructed terrain as superpixel surfaces (i.e. segments), an image segmentation technique is applied using geometry-based features (pixel-based surface normals). Having detected all the surfaces, Superpixel Surface Traversability Analysis approach (SSTA) is applied on all of the detected surfaces (superpixel segments) in order to classify them based on their traversability index. The proposed SSTA approach is based on: (1) Superpixel surface normal and plane estimation, (2) Traversability analysis using superpixel surface planes.

In this letter, we propose a novel framework that organically combines the spectrum-based deep metric learning model and the conditional random field algorithm. The deep metric learning model is supervised by the center loss to produce spectrum-based features that gather more tightly in Euclidean space within classes. The conditional random field with Gaussian edge potentials, which is firstly proposed for image segmentation tasks, is introduced to give the pixel-wise classification over the hyperspectral image by utilizing both the geographical distances between pixels and the Euclidean distances between the features produced by the deep metric learning model. The proposed framework is trained by spectral pixels at the deep metric learning stage and utilizes the half handcrafted spatial features at the conditional random field stage. This settlement alleviates the shortage of training data to some extent. Experiments on two real hyperspectral images demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both classification accuracy and computation cost.",0
"Numerous techniques have been developed to enhance the classification performance of hyperspectral image processing. Two common strategies include the integration of spatial-spectral information and the use of neural networks. However, these approaches typically require more training data than classical algorithms, which poses a challenge due to the lack of labeled samples. In this study, we suggest a new framework that combines a deep metric learning model based on spectra and a conditional random field algorithm. The deep metric learning model uses center loss to generate spectrum-based features that are more closely grouped in Euclidean space within classes. The conditional random field algorithm, which was initially designed for image segmentation tasks, is introduced to enable pixel-wise classification across the hyperspectral image by incorporating both the distance between pixels and the distance between features generated by the deep metric learning model. The proposed framework is trained using spectral pixels in the deep metric learning stage and utilizes half handcrafted spatial features in the conditional random field stage, thereby easing the shortage of training data to some extent. Experimental results on two real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method offers advantages in terms of both classification accuracy and computation cost.",1
"Deep neural networks have achieved tremendous success in various fields including medical image segmentation. However, they have long been criticized for being a black-box, in that interpretation, understanding and correcting architectures is difficult as there is no general theory for deep neural network design. Previously, precision learning was proposed to fuse deep architectures and traditional approaches. Deep networks constructed in this way benefit from the original known operator, have fewer parameters, and improved interpretability. However, they do not yield state-of-the-art performance in all applications. In this paper, we propose to analyze deep networks using known operators, by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy to replace network components, whilst retaining its performance. The task of retinal vessel segmentation is investigated for this purpose. We start with a high-performance U-Net and show by step-by-step conversion that we are able to divide the network into modules of known operators. The results indicate that a combination of a trainable guided filter and a trainable version of the Frangi filter yields a performance at the level of U-Net (AUC 0.974 vs. 0.972) with a tremendous reduction in parameters (111,536 vs. 9,575). In addition, the trained layers can be mapped back into their original algorithmic interpretation and analyzed using standard tools of signal processing.",0

"Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches have focused on learning image intensity features for segmentation, whereas the incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention. In this paper, we combine a multi-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to develop a shape-constrained bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis CMR volumetric images. The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously. The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy. Moreover, the refinement step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape constraint and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful 3D cardiac shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to initialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical experiments on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable of producing accurate, high-resolution and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular 3D models, despite the artefacts in input CMR volumes.",0

"Current state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation form a dense image representation where the color, shape and texture information are all processed together inside a deep CNN. This however may not be ideal as they contain very different type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new two-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires shape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that processes information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this architecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the two streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical stream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively removing noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the relevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow architecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution. Our experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that produces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts performance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask (mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong baselines.",0

"Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in biomedical image processing, which recent breakthroughs in deep learning have allowed to improve. However, deep learning methods in general are not yet widely used in practice since they require large amount of data for training complex models. This is particularly challenging for biomedical images, because data and ground truths are a scarce resource. Annotation efforts for biomedical images come with a real cost, since experts have to manually label images at pixel-level on samples usually containing many instances of the target anatomy (e.g. in histology samples: neurons, astrocytes, mitochondria, etc.). In this paper we provide a framework for Deep Active Learning applied to a real-world scenario. Our framework relies on the U-Net architecture and overall uncertainty measure to suggest which sample to annotate. It takes advantage of the uncertainty measure obtained by taking Monte Carlo samples while using Dropout regularization scheme. Experiments were done on spinal cord and brain microscopic histology samples to perform a myelin segmentation task. Two realistic small datasets of 14 and 24 images were used, from different acquisition settings (Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy and Transmitting Electron Microscopy) and showed that our method reached a maximum Dice value after adding 3 uncertainty-selected samples to the initial training set, versus 15 randomly-selected samples, thereby significantly reducing the annotation effort. We focused on a plausible scenario and showed evidence that this straightforward implementation achieves a high segmentation performance with very few labelled samples. We believe our framework may benefit any biomedical researcher willing to obtain fast and accurate image segmentation on their own dataset. The code is freely available at https://github.com/neuropoly/deep-active-learning.",0

"Selective segmentation involves incorporating user input to partition an image into foreground and background, by discriminating between objects of a similar type. Typically, such methods involve introducing additional constraints to generic segmentation approaches. However, we show that this is often inconsistent with respect to common assumptions about the image. The proposed method introduces a new fitting term that is more useful in practice than the Chan-Vese framework.

"In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have transformed the field of medical image analysis due to their capacity to learn discriminative image features for a variety of classification and regression tasks. However, successfully learning these features requires a large amount of manually annotated data, which is expensive to acquire and limited by the available resources of expert image analysts. Therefore, unsupervised, weakly-supervised and self-supervised feature learning techniques receive a lot of attention, which aim to utilise the vast amount of available data, while at the same time avoid or substantially reduce the effort of manual annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel way for training a cardiac MR image segmentation network, in which features are learnt in a self-supervised manner by predicting anatomical positions. The anatomical positions serve as a supervisory signal and do not require extra manual annotation. We demonstrate that this seemingly simple task provides a strong signal for feature learning and with self-supervised learning, we achieve a high segmentation accuracy that is better than or comparable to a U-net trained from scratch, especially at a small data setting. When only five annotated subjects are available, the proposed method improves the mean Dice metric from 0.811 to 0.852 for short-axis image segmentation, compared to the baseline U-net.",0

"With the recent advances in complex networks theory, graph-based techniques for image segmentation has attracted great attention recently. In order to segment the image into meaningful connected components, this paper proposes an image segmentation general framework using complex networks based community detection algorithms. If we consider regions as communities, using community detection algorithms directly can lead to an over-segmented image. To address this problem, we start by splitting the image into small regions using an initial segmentation. The obtained regions are used for building the complex network. To produce meaningful connected components and detect homogeneous communities, some combinations of color and texture based features are employed in order to quantify the regions similarities. To sum up, the network of regions is constructed adaptively to avoid many small regions in the image, and then, community detection algorithms are applied on the resulting adaptive similarity matrix to obtain the final segmented image. Experiments are conducted on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and four of the most influential community detection algorithms are tested.

"Advances in the image-based diagnostics of complex biological and manufacturing processes have brought unsupervised image segmentation to the forefront of enabling automated, on the fly decision making. However, most existing unsupervised segmentation approaches are either computationally complex or require manual parameter selection (e.g., flow capacities in max-flow/min-cut segmentation). In this work, we present a fully unsupervised segmentation approach using a continuous max-flow formulation over the image domain while optimally estimating the flow parameters from the image characteristics. More specifically, we show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of the image labels can be formulated as a continuous max-flow problem given the flow capacities are known. The flow capacities are then iteratively obtained by employing a novel Markov random field prior over the image domain. We present theoretical results to establish the posterior consistency of the flow capacities. We compare the performance of our approach on two real-world case studies including brain tumor image segmentation and defect identification in additively manufactured components using electron microscopic images.

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show outstanding performance in many image processing problems, such as image recognition, object detection and image segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a very challenging task that requires recognizing, understanding what's in the image in pixel level. Though the state of the art has been greatly improved by CNNs, there is no explicit connections between prediction of neighbouring pixels. That is, spatial regularity of the segmented objects is still a problem for CNNs. In this paper, we propose a method to add spatial regularization to the segmented objects. In our method, the spatial regularization such as total variation (TV) can be easily integrated into CNN network. It can help CNN find a better local optimum and make the segmentation results more robust to noise. We apply our proposed method to Unet and Segnet, which are well established CNNs for image segmentation, and test them on WBC, CamVid and SUN-RGBD datasets, respectively. The results show that the regularized networks not only could provide better segmentation results with regularization effect than the original ones but also have certain robustness to noise.",0

"To evaluate their performance, existing dehazing approaches generally rely on distance measures between the generated image and its corresponding ground truth. Despite its ability to produce visually good images, using pixel-based or even perceptual metrics do not guarantee, in general, that the produced image is fit for being used as input for low-level computer vision tasks such as segmentation. To overcome this weakness, we are proposing a novel end-to-end approach for image dehazing, fit for being used as input to an image segmentation procedure, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the generator by introducing a discriminator network and a loss function that evaluates segmentation quality of dehazed images. In addition, we make use of a supplementary loss function that verifies that the visual and the perceptual quality of the generated image are preserved in hazy conditions. Results obtained using the proposed technique are appealing, with a favorable comparison to state-of-the-art approaches when considering the performance of segmentation algorithms on the hazy images.",0

"Semantic segmentation is essentially important to biomedical image analysis. Many recent works mainly focus on integrating the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture with sophisticated convolution implementation and deep supervision. In this paper, we propose to decompose the single segmentation task into three subsequent sub-tasks, including (1) pixel-wise image segmentation, (2) prediction of the class labels of the objects within the image, and (3) classification of the scene the image belonging to. While these three sub-tasks are trained to optimize their individual loss functions of different perceptual levels, we propose to let them interact by the task-task context ensemble. Moreover, we propose a novel sync-regularization to penalize the deviation between the outputs of the pixel-wise segmentation and the class prediction tasks. These effective regularizations help FCN utilize context information comprehensively and attain accurate semantic segmentation, even though the number of the images for training may be limited in many biomedical applications. We have successfully applied our framework to three diverse 2D/3D medical image datasets, including Robotic Scene Segmentation Challenge 18 (ROBOT18), Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 18 (BRATS18), and Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE18). We have achieved top-tier performance in all three challenges.",0

"One of the key drawbacks of 3D convolutional neural networks for segmentation is their memory footprint, which necessitates compromises in the network architecture in order to fit into a given memory budget. Motivated by the RevNet for image classification, we propose a partially reversible U-Net architecture that reduces memory consumption substantially. The reversible architecture allows us to exactly recover each layer's outputs from the subsequent layer's ones, eliminating the need to store activations for backpropagation. This alleviates the biggest memory bottleneck and enables very deep (theoretically infinitely deep) 3D architectures. On the BraTS challenge dataset, we demonstrate substantial memory savings. We further show that the freed memory can be used for processing the whole field-of-view (FOV) instead of patches. Increasing network depth led to higher segmentation accuracy while growing the memory footprint only by a very small fraction, thanks to the partially reversible architecture.",0

"Deep learning based models, generally, require a large number of samples for appropriate training, a requirement that is difficult to satisfy in the medical field. This issue can usually be avoided with a proper initialization of the weights. On the task of medical image segmentation in general, two techniques are oftentimes employed to tackle the training of a deep network $f_T$. The first one consists in reusing some weights of a network $f_S$ pre-trained on a large scale database ($e.g.$ ImageNet). This procedure, also known as $transfer$ $learning$, happens to reduce the flexibility when it comes to new network design since $f_T$ is constrained to match some parts of $f_S$. The second commonly used technique consists in working on image patches to benefit from the large number of available patches. This paper brings together these two techniques and propose to train $arbitrarily$ $designed$ $networks$ that segment an image in one forward pass, with a focus on relatively small databases. An experimental work have been carried out on the tasks of retinal blood vessel segmentation and the optic disc one, using four publicly available databases. Furthermore, three types of network are considered, going from a very light weighted network to a densely connected one. The final results show the efficiency of the proposed framework along with state of the art results on all the databases.",0
"In the medical field, it is challenging to meet the large sample requirement for appropriate training of deep learning models. However, this issue can be mitigated by initializing weights correctly. When training deep network $f_T$ for medical image segmentation, two techniques are commonly used.

The second technique involves working on image patches to benefit from the availability of numerous patches. This paper proposes combining these two techniques to train arbitrarily designed networks for image segmentation in one forward pass, with a focus on relatively small databases.

"3D image segmentation is one of the most important and ubiquitous problems in medical image processing. It provides detailed quantitative analysis for accurate disease diagnosis, abnormal detection, and classification. Currently deep learning algorithms are widely used in medical image segmentation, most algorithms trained models with full annotated datasets. However, obtaining medical image datasets is very difficult and expensive, and full annotation of 3D medical image is a monotonous and time-consuming work. Partially labelling informative slices in 3D images will be a great relief of manual annotation. Sample selection strategies based on active learning have been proposed in the field of 2D image, but few strategies focus on 3D images. In this paper, we propose a sparse annotation strategy based on attention-guided active learning for 3D medical image segmentation. Attention mechanism is used to improve segmentation accuracy and estimate the segmentation accuracy of each slice. The comparative experiments with three different strategies using datasets from the developing human connectome project (dHCP) show that, our strategy only needs 15% to 20% annotated slices in brain extraction task and 30% to 35% annotated slices in tissue segmentation task to achieve comparative results as full annotation.",0

"In this paper, a neural architecture search (NAS) framework is proposed for 3D medical image segmentation, to automatically optimize a neural architecture from a large design space. Our NAS framework searches the structure of each layer including neural connectivities and operation types in both of the encoder and decoder. Since optimizing over a large discrete architecture space is difficult due to high-resolution 3D medical images, a novel stochastic sampling algorithm based on a continuous relaxation is also proposed for scalable gradient based optimization.

"Segmentation algorithms are prone to make topological errors on fine-scale structures, e.g., broken connections. We propose a novel method that learns to segment with correct topology. In particular, we design a continuous-valued loss function that enforces a segmentation to have the same topology as the ground truth, i.e., having the same Betti number. The proposed topology-preserving loss function is differentiable and we incorporate it into end-to-end training of a deep neural network. Our method achieves much better performance on the Betti number error, which directly accounts for the topological correctness. It also performs superiorly on other topology-relevant metrics, e.g., the Adjusted Rand Index and the Variation of Information.

"Recent advances in deep learning for medical image segmentation demonstrate expert-level accuracy. However, in clinically realistic environments, such methods have marginal performance due to differences in image domains, including different imaging protocols, device vendors and patient populations. Here we consider the problem of domain generalization, when a model is trained once, and its performance generalizes to unseen domains. Intuitively, within a specific medical imaging modality the domain differences are smaller relative to natural images domain variability. We rethink data augmentation for medical 3D images and propose a deep stacked transformations (DST) approach for domain generalization. Specifically, a series of n stacked transformations are applied to each image in each mini-batch during network training to account for the contribution of domain-specific shifts in medical images. We comprehensively evaluate our method on three tasks: segmentation of whole prostate from 3D MRI, left atrial from 3D MRI, and left ventricle from 3D ultrasound. We demonstrate that when trained on a small source dataset, (i) on average, DST models on unseen datasets degrade only by 11% (Dice score change), compared to the conventional augmentation (degrading 39%) and CycleGAN-based domain adaptation method (degrading 25%); (ii) when evaluation on the same domain, DST is also better albeit only marginally. (iii) When training on large-sized data, DST on unseen domains reaches performance of state-of-the-art fully supervised models. These findings establish a strong benchmark for the study of domain generalization in medical imaging, and can be generalized to the design of robust deep segmentation models for clinical deployment.",0

"Adversarial learning has been proven to be effective for capturing long-range and high-level label consistencies in semantic segmentation. Unique to medical imaging, capturing 3D semantics in an effective yet computationally efficient way remains an open problem. In this study, we address this computational burden by proposing a novel projective adversarial network, called PAN, which incorporates high-level 3D information through 2D projections. Furthermore, we introduce an attention module into our framework that helps for a selective integration of global information directly from our segmentor to our adversarial network.

"Encoder-decoder architectures are widely adopted for medical image segmentation tasks. With the lateral skip connection, the models can obtain and fuse both semantic and resolution information in deep layers to achieve more accurate segmentation performance. However, in many applications (e.g., blurry boundary images), these models often cannot precisely locate complex boundaries and segment tiny isolated parts. To solve this challenging problem, we firstly analyze why simple skip connections are not enough to help accurately locate indistinct boundaries and argue that it is due to the fuzzy information in the skip connection provided in the encoder layers. Then we propose a semantic-guided encoder feature learning strategy to learn both high resolution and rich semantic encoder features so that we can more accurately locate the blurry boundaries, which can also enhance the network by selectively learning discriminative features. Besides, we further propose a soft contour constraint mechanism to model the blurry boundary detection. Experimental results on real clinical datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, especially for the blurry regions. Further analysis also indicates that our proposed network components indeed contribute to the improvement of performance. Experiments on additional datasets validate the generalization ability of our proposed method.",0

"In this work, we explore the issue of the inter-annotator agreement for training and evaluating automated segmentation of skin lesions. We explore what different degrees of agreement represent, and how they affect different use cases for segmentation. We also evaluate how conditioning the ground truths using different (but very simple) algorithms may help to enhance agreement and may be appropriate for some use cases. The segmentation of skin lesions is a cornerstone task for automated skin lesion analysis, useful both as an end-result to locate/detect the lesions and as an ancillary task for lesion classification. Lesion segmentation, however, is a very challenging task, due not only to the challenge of image segmentation itself but also to the difficulty in obtaining properly annotated data. Detecting accurately the borders of lesions is challenging even for trained humans, since, for many lesions, those borders are fuzzy and ill-defined. Using lesions and annotations from the ISIC Archive, we estimate inter-annotator agreement for skin-lesion segmentation and propose several simple procedures that may help to improve inter-annotator agreement if used to condition the ground truths.",0

"Volumetric image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounters several challenges, which are specific to medical images. Among these challenges are large volumes of interest, high class imbalances, and difficulties in learning shape representations. To tackle these challenges, we propose to improve over traditional CNN-based volumetric image segmentation through point-wise classification of point clouds. The sparsity of point clouds allows processing of entire image volumes, balancing highly imbalanced segmentation problems, and explicitly learning an anatomical shape. We build upon PointCNN, a neural network proposed to process point clouds, and propose here to jointly encode shape and volumetric information within the point cloud in a compact and computationally effective manner. We demonstrate how this approach can then be used to refine CNN-based segmentation, which yields significantly improved results in our experiments on the difficult task of peripheral nerve segmentation from magnetic resonance neurography images. By synthetic experiments, we further show the capability of our approach in learning an explicit anatomical shape representation.",0

"Deep learning (DL) approaches are state-of-the-art for many medical image segmentation tasks. They offer a number of advantages: they can be trained for specific tasks, computations are fast at test time, and segmentation quality is typically high. In contrast, previously popular multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) methods are relatively slow (as they rely on costly registrations) and even though sophisticated label fusion strategies have been proposed, DL approaches generally outperform MAS. In this work, we propose a DL-based label fusion strategy (VoteNet) which locally selects a set of reliable atlases whose labels are then fused via plurality voting. Experiments on 3D brain MRI data show that by selecting a good initial atlas set MAS with VoteNet significantly outperforms a number of other label fusion strategies as well as a direct DL segmentation approach. We also provide an experimental analysis of the upper performance bound achievable by our method. While unlikely achievable in practice, this bound suggests room for further performance improvements.

"Methods that move towards less supervised scenarios are key for image segmentation, as dense labels demand significant human intervention. Generally, the annotation burden is mitigated by labeling datasets with weaker forms of supervision, e.g. image-level labels or bounding boxes. Another option are semi-supervised settings, that commonly leverage a few strong annotations and a huge number of unlabeled/weakly-labeled data. In this paper, we revisit semi-supervised segmentation schemes and narrow down significantly the annotation budget (in terms of total labeling time of the training set) compared to previous approaches. With a very simple pipeline, we demonstrate that at low annotation budgets, semi-supervised methods outperform by a wide margin weakly-supervised ones for both semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach also outperforms previous semi-supervised works at a much reduced labeling cost. We present results for the Pascal VOC benchmark and unify weakly and semi-supervised approaches by considering the total annotation budget, thus allowing a fairer comparison between methods.",0

"In response to the growing importance of geospatial data, its analysis including semantic segmentation becomes an increasingly popular task in computer vision today. Convolutional neural networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features and practitioners widely use them to process remote sensing data. When performing remote sensing image segmentation, multiple instances of one class with precisely defined boundaries are often the case, and it is crucial to extract those boundaries accurately. The accuracy of segments boundaries delineation influences the quality of the whole segmented areas explicitly. However, widely-used segmentation loss functions such as BCE, IoU loss or Dice loss do not penalize misalignment of boundaries sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely a differentiable surrogate of a metric accounting accuracy of boundary detection. We can use the loss function with any neural network for binary segmentation. We performed validation of our loss function with various modifications of UNet on a synthetic dataset, as well as using real-world data (ISPRS Potsdam, INRIA AIL).

"Automatic segmentation of organs-at-risk (OAR) in computed tomography (CT) is an essential part of planning effective treatment strategies to combat lung and esophageal cancer. Accurate segmentation of organs surrounding tumours helps account for the variation in position and morphology inherent across patients, thereby facilitating adaptive and computer-assisted radiotherapy.

"Automated design of neural network architectures tailored for a specific task is an extremely promising, albeit inherently difficult, avenue to explore. While most results in this domain have been achieved on image classification and language modelling problems, here we concentrate on dense per-pixel tasks, in particular, semantic image segmentation using fully convolutional networks. In contrast to the aforementioned areas, the design choices of a fully convolutional network require several changes, ranging from the sort of operations that need to be used---e.g., dilated convolutions---to a solving of a more difficult optimisation problem. In this work, we are particularly interested in searching for high-performance compact segmentation architectures, able to run in real-time using limited resources. To achieve that, we intentionally over-parameterise the architecture during the training time via a set of auxiliary cells that provide an intermediate supervisory signal and can be omitted during the evaluation phase. The design of the auxiliary cell is emitted by a controller, a neural network with the fixed structure trained using reinforcement learning. More crucially, we demonstrate how to efficiently search for these architectures within limited time and computational budgets. In particular, we rely on a progressive strategy that terminates non-promising architectures from being further trained, and on Polyak averaging coupled with knowledge distillation to speed-up the convergence. Quantitatively, in 8 GPU-days our approach discovers a set of architectures performing on-par with state-of-the-art among compact models on the semantic segmentation, pose estimation and depth prediction tasks.

"Since acquiring pixel-wise annotations for training convolutional neural networks for semantic image segmentation is time-consuming, weakly supervised approaches that only require class tags have been proposed. In this work, we propose another form of supervision, namely image captions as they can be found on the Internet. These captions have two advantages. They do not require additional curation as it is the case for the clean class tags used by current weakly supervised approaches and they provide textual context for the classes present in an image. To leverage such textual context, we deploy a multi-modal network that learns a joint embedding of the visual representation of the image and the textual representation of the caption. The network estimates text activation maps (TAMs) for class names as well as compound concepts, i.e. combinations of nouns and their attributes. The TAMs of compound concepts describing classes of interest substantially improve the quality of the estimated class activation maps which are then used to train a network for semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method on the COCO dataset where it achieves state of the art results for weakly supervised image segmentation.",0

"Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely applied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively and be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a good machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good model training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each procedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible local optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the diversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and inference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the machine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation, object detection, topic modeling, and others.

A good machine learning system comprises a large amount of training data, an efficient model training process, and accurate inference. Diverse aspects of the machine learning process can impact its performance, with diversity being a crucial factor. Diversity can facilitate a good machine learning process by ensuring that the training data provides more informative details, the learned model captures unique or complementary information, and the inference provides several alternatives that correspond to specific optimal results. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the diversification process in machine learning systems. This paper aims to summarize the methods used to diversify the data, model, and inference in the machine learning process, respectively. Moreover, it surveys typical applications that have benefitted from diversity technology, including remote sensing imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation, object detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, it discusses the challenges associated with diversity technology in machine learning and suggests future directions for research.",1
"Pap smear testing has been widely used for detecting cervical cancers based on the morphology properties of cell nuclei in microscopic image. An accurate nuclei segmentation could thus improve the success rate of cervical cancer screening. In this work, a method of automated cervical nuclei segmentation using Deformable Multipath Ensemble Model (D-MEM) is proposed. The approach adopts a U-shaped convolutional network as a backbone network, in which dense blocks are used to transfer feature information more effectively. To increase the flexibility of the model, we then use deformable convolution to deal with different nuclei irregular shapes and sizes. To reduce the predictive bias, we further construct multiple networks with different settings, which form an ensemble model. The proposed segmentation framework has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on Herlev dataset with Zijdenbos similarity index (ZSI) of 0.933, and has the potential to be extended for solving other medical image segmentation tasks.",0

"This paper proposes the first, known to us, open source presentation attack detection (PAD) solution to distinguish between authentic iris images (possibly wearing clear contact lenses) and irises with textured contact lenses. This software can serve as a baseline in various PAD evaluations, and also as an open-source platform with an up-to-date reference method for iris PAD. The software is written in C++ and Python and uses only open source resources, such as OpenCV. This method does not incorporate iris image segmentation, which may be problematic for unknown fake samples. Instead, it makes a best guess to localize the rough position of the iris. The PAD-related features are extracted with the Binary Statistical Image Features (BSIF), which are classified by an ensemble of classifiers incorporating support vector machine, random forest and multilayer perceptron. The models attached to the current software have been trained with the NDCLD'15 database and evaluated on the independent datasets included in the LivDet-Iris 2017 competition. The software implements the functionality of retraining the classifiers with any database of authentic and attack images. The accuracy of the current version offered with this paper exceeds 99% when tested on subject-disjoint subsets of NDCLD'15, and oscillates around 85% when tested on the LivDet-Iris 2017 benchmarks, which is on par with the results obtained by the LivDet-Iris 2017 winner.",0

"What did it feel like to walk through a city from the past? In this work, we describe Nostalgin (Nostalgia Engine), a method that can faithfully reconstruct cities from historical images. Unlike existing work in city reconstruction, we focus on the task of reconstructing 3D cities from historical images. Working with historical image data is substantially more difficult, as there are significantly fewer buildings available and the details of the camera parameters which captured the images are unknown. Nostalgin can generate a city model even if there is only a single image per facade, regardless of viewpoint or occlusions. To achieve this, our novel architecture combines image segmentation, rectification, and inpainting. We motivate our design decisions with experimental analysis of individual components of our pipeline, and show that we can improve on baselines in both speed and visual realism. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline by recreating two 1940s Manhattan city blocks. We aim to deploy Nostalgin as an open source platform where users can generate immersive historical experiences from their own photos.",0

"Most of the semantic segmentation approaches have been developed for single image segmentation, and hence, video sequences are currently segmented by processing each frame of the video sequence separately. The disadvantage of this is that temporal image information is not considered, which improves the performance of the segmentation approach. One possibility to include temporal information is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few approaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far. These approaches extend the encoder-decoder network architecture of well-known segmentation approaches and place convolutional LSTM layers between encoder and decoder. However, in this paper it is shown that this position is not optimal, and that other positions in the network exhibit better performance. Nowadays, state-of-the-art segmentation approaches rarely use the classical encoder-decoder structure, but use multi-branch architectures. These architectures are more complex, and hence, it is more difficult to place the recurrent units at a proper position. In this work, the multi-branch architectures are extended by convolutional LSTM layers at different positions and evaluated on two different datasets in order to find the best one. It turned out that the proposed approach outperforms the pure CNN-based approach for up to 1.6 percent.",0

"Recent progress in biomedical image segmentation based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has drawn much attention. However, its vulnerability towards adversarial samples cannot be overlooked. This paper is the first one that discovers that all the CNN-based state-of-the-art biomedical image segmentation models are sensitive to adversarial perturbations. This limits the deployment of these methods in safety-critical biomedical fields. In this paper, we discover that global spatial dependencies and global contextual information in a biomedical image can be exploited to defend against adversarial attacks. To this end, non-local context encoder (NLCE) is proposed to model short- and long range spatial dependencies and encode global contexts for strengthening feature activations by channel-wise attention. The NLCE modules enhance the robustness and accuracy of the non-local context encoding network (NLCEN), which learns robust enhanced pyramid feature representations with NLCE modules, and then integrates the information across different levels. Experiments on both lung and skin lesion segmentation datasets have demonstrated that NLCEN outperforms any other state-of-the-art biomedical image segmentation methods against adversarial attacks. In addition, NLCE modules can be applied to improve the robustness of other CNN-based biomedical image segmentation methods.",0

"It is important to find the target as soon as possible for search and rescue operations. Surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to support search and rescue. Automatic object detection is important because a person cannot monitor multiple surveillance screens simultaneously for 24 hours. Also, the object is often too small to be recognized by the human eye on the surveillance screen. This study used UAVs around the Port of Houston and fixed surveillance cameras to build an automatic target detection system that supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to help find targets (e.g., person overboard). We combined image segmentation, enhancement, and convolution neural networks to reduce detection time to detect small targets. We compared the performance between the auto-detection system and the human eye. Our system detected the target within 8 seconds, but the human eye detected the target within 25 seconds. Our systems also used synthetic data generation and data augmentation techniques to improve target detection accuracy. This solution may help the search and rescue operations of the first responders in a timely manner.",0
"Swift identification of the target is crucial in search and rescue missions, hence the use of surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to aid the process.

"Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) gained tremendous attention in recent years. Autonomous flight in indoor requires a dense depth map for navigable space detection which is the fundamental component for autonomous navigation. In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing dense depth while a drone is hovering (small camera motion) in indoor scenes using already estimated cameras and sparse point cloud obtained from a vSLAM. We start by segmenting the scene based on sudden depth variation using sparse 3D points and introduce a patch-based local plane fitting via energy minimization which combines photometric consistency and co-planarity with neighbouring patches. The method also combines a plane sweep technique for image segments having almost no sparse point for initialization. Experiments show, the proposed method produces better depth for indoor in artificial lighting condition, low-textured environment compared to earlier literature in small motion.",0

"In this paper, we propose a novel iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) that is applicable to a range of variational models for image segmentation. A variational model usually minimizes an energy functional consisting of a fidelity term and a regularization term. In the ICTM, the interface between two different segment domains is implicitly represented by their characteristic functions. The fidelity term is then usually written as a linear functional of the characteristic functions and the regularized term is approximated by a functional of characteristic functions in terms of heat kernel convolution. This allows us to design an iterative convolution-thresholding method to minimize the approximate energy. The method is simple, efficient and enjoys the energy-decaying property. Numerical experiments show that the method is easy to implement, robust and applicable to various image segmentation models.",0

"Cardiac image segmentation is a critical process for generating personalized models of the heart and for quantifying cardiac performance parameters. Several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have been proposed to segment the heart chambers from cardiac cine MR images. Here we propose a multi-task learning (MTL)-based regularization framework for cardiac MR image segmentation.

"The quality of images captured in outdoor environments can be affected by poor weather conditions such as fog, dust, and atmospheric scattering of other particles. This problem can bring extra challenges to high-level computer vision tasks like image segmentation and object detection. However, previous studies on image dehazing suffer from a huge computational workload and corruption of the original image, such as over-saturation and halos. In this paper, we present a novel image dehazing approach based on the optical model for haze images and regularized optimization. Specifically, we convert the non-convex, bilinear problem concerning the unknown haze-free image and light transmission distribution to a convex, linear optimization problem by estimating the atmosphere light constant. Our method is further accelerated by introducing a multilevel Haar wavelet transform. The optimization, instead, is applied to the low frequency sub-band decomposition of the original image. This dimension reduction significantly improves the processing speed of our method and exhibits the potential for real-time applications.

"In order to create an image segmentation method robust to lighting changes, two novel homogeneity criteria of an image region were studied. Both were defined using the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) framework whose laws model lighting changes. The first criterion estimates the LIP-additive homogeneity and is based on the LIP-additive law. It is theoretically insensitive to lighting changes caused by variations of the camera exposure-time or source intensity. The second, the LIP-multiplicative homogeneity criterion, is based on the LIP-multiplicative law and is insensitive to changes due to variations of the object thickness or opacity. Each criterion is then applied in Revol and Jourlin's (1997) region growing method which is based on the homogeneity of an image region. The region growing method becomes therefore robust to the lighting changes specific to each criterion. Experiments on simulated and on real images presenting lighting variations prove the robustness of the criteria to those variations. Compared to a state-of the art method based on the image component-tree, ours is more robust. These results open the way to numerous applications where the lighting is uncontrolled or partially controlled.",0
"To develop a dependable image segmentation approach that can withstand lighting changes, two innovative homogeneity criteria were examined. These criteria were formulated utilizing the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) framework, which utilizes laws that simulate lighting changes. The first criterion measures the LIP-additive homogeneity and is founded on the LIP-additive law. It is theoretically unaffected by lighting changes induced by alterations in the camera exposure-time or source intensity. The second criterion, called the LIP-multiplicative homogeneity criterion, is established on the LIP-multiplicative law and is unaffected by changes arising from variations in the object thickness or opacity. Both criteria are applied in Revol and Jourlin's (1997) region growing method, which focuses on the homogeneity of an image region. As a result, the region growing method becomes resistant to the lighting changes unique to each criterion. Experiments conducted on simulated and real images displaying lighting variations confirm the criteria's resistance to such changes. In comparison to a state-of-the-art method based on the image component-tree, our approach is more dependable.

"Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques based on Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) are applied to micro-computed tomography ({\mu}CT) images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. Digital rock imaging is limited by the capability of the scanning device resulting in trade-offs between resolution and field of view, and super resolution methods tested in this study aim to compensate for these limits. SRCNN models SR-Resnet, Enhanced Deep SR (EDSR), and Wide-Activation Deep SR (WDSR) are used on the Digital Rock Super Resolution 1 (DRSRD1) Dataset of 4x downsampled images, comprising of 2000 high resolution (800x800) raw micro-CT images of Bentheimer sandstone and Estaillades carbonate. The trained models are applied to the validation and test data within the dataset and show a 3-5 dB rise in image quality compared to bicubic interpolation, with all tested models performing within a 0.1 dB range. Difference maps indicate that edge sharpness is completely recovered in images within the scope of the trained model, with only high frequency noise related detail loss. We find that aside from generation of high-resolution images, a beneficial side effect of super resolution methods applied to synthetically downgraded images is the removal of image noise while recovering edgewise sharpness which is beneficial for the segmentation process. The model is also tested against real low-resolution images of Bentheimer rock with image augmentation to account for natural noise and blur. The SRCNN method is shown to act as a preconditioner for image segmentation under these circumstances which naturally leads to further future development and training of models that segment an image directly. Image restoration by SRCNN on the rock images is of significantly higher quality than traditional methods and suggests SRCNN methods are a viable processing step in a digital rock workflow.",0

"Automated digital histopathology image segmentation is an important task to help pathologists diagnose tumors and cancer subtypes. For pathological diagnosis of cancer subtypes, pathologists usually change the magnification of whole-slide images (WSI) viewers.

In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation method, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can adaptively use image features from images with different magnifications to segment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed method aggregates several expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by adaptively changing the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It leverages information in the images with different magnifications that might be useful for identifying the subtypes. It outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in experiments.",0

The significance of the magnification is believed to vary with the properties of the input image, such as cancer subtypes. This article proposes a new semantic segmentation technique known as Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), which can flexibly utilize image features from images with distinct magnifications to segment various cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed technique combines various expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by dynamically adjusting the weight of each specialist based on the input image. It employs information from images with various magnifications that could be useful in identifying the subtypes. In experiments, the proposed technique outperformed other cutting-edge techniques.",1
"We propose and study a task we name panoptic segmentation (PS). Panoptic segmentation unifies the typically distinct tasks of semantic segmentation (assign a class label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detect and segment each object instance). The proposed task requires generating a coherent scene segmentation that is rich and complete, an important step toward real-world vision systems. While early work in computer vision addressed related image/scene parsing tasks, these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or associated recognition challenges. To address this, we propose a novel panoptic quality (PQ) metric that captures performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner. Using the proposed metric, we perform a rigorous study of both human and machine performance for PS on three existing datasets, revealing interesting insights about the task. The aim of our work is to revive the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation.",0
"The task of panoptic segmentation (PS) is introduced and examined in this study. PS combines the previously separate tasks of semantic segmentation (assigning a label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detecting and segmenting each object instance) to generate a comprehensive and cohesive scene segmentation.

"We address interactive full image annotation, where the goal is to accurately segment all object and stuff regions in an image. We propose an interactive, scribble-based annotation framework which operates on the whole image to produce segmentations for all regions. This enables sharing scribble corrections across regions, and allows the annotator to focus on the largest errors made by the machine across the whole image. To realize this, we adapt Mask-RCNN into a fast interactive segmentation framework and introduce an instance-aware loss measured at the pixel-level in the full image canvas, which lets predictions for nearby regions properly compete for space. Finally, we compare to interactive single object segmentation on the COCO panoptic dataset. We demonstrate that our interactive full image segmentation approach leads to a 5% IoU gain, reaching 90% IoU at a budget of four extreme clicks and four corrective scribbles per region.",0
"Our focus is on accurately segmenting all object and stuff regions in an image through interactive full image annotation.

Our interactive full image segmentation approach has been tested against interactive single object segmentation on the COCO panoptic dataset and has yielded a 5% IoU gain, achieving 90% IoU with only four extreme clicks and four corrective scribbles per region.",1
"Binary segmentation of volumetric images of porous media is a crucial step towards gaining a deeper understanding of the factors governing biogeochemical processes at minute scales. Contemporary work primarily revolves around primitive techniques based on global or local adaptive thresholding that have known common drawbacks in image segmentation. Moreover, absence of a unified benchmark prohibits quantitative evaluation, which further clouds the impact of existing methodologies. In this study, we tackle the issue on both fronts. Firstly, by drawing parallels with natural image segmentation, we propose a novel, and automatic segmentation technique, 3D Quantum Cuts (QCuts-3D) grounded on a state-of-the-art spectral clustering technique. Secondly, we curate and present a publicly available dataset of 68 multiphase volumetric images of porous media with diverse solid geometries, along with voxel-wise ground truth annotations for each constituting phase. We provide comparative evaluations between QCuts-3D and the current state-of-the-art over this dataset across a variety of evaluation metrics. The proposed systematic approach achieves a 26% increase in AUROC while achieving a substantial reduction of the computational complexity of the state-of-the-art competitors. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals that the proposed method exhibits significant robustness against the compositional variations of porous media.",0

"We consider the problem of referring image segmentation. Given an input image and a natural language expression, the goal is to segment the object referred by the language expression in the image. Existing works in this area treat the language expression and the input image separately in their representations. They do not sufficiently capture long-range correlations between these two modalities. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal self-attention (CMSA) module that effectively captures the long-range dependencies between linguistic and visual features. Our model can adaptively focus on informative words in the referring expression and important regions in the input image. In addition, we propose a gated multi-level fusion module to selectively integrate self-attentive cross-modal features corresponding to different levels in the image. This module controls the information flow of features at different levels. We validate the proposed approach on four evaluation datasets.

"Cloud based medical image analysis has become popular recently due to the high computation complexities of various deep neural network (DNN) based frameworks and the increasingly large volume of medical images that need to be processed. It has been demonstrated that for medical images the transmission from local to clouds is much more expensive than the computation in the clouds itself. Towards this, 3D image compression techniques have been widely applied to reduce the data traffic. However, most of the existing image compression techniques are developed around human vision, i.e., they are designed to minimize distortions that can be perceived by human eyes. In this paper we will use deep learning based medical image segmentation as a vehicle and demonstrate that interestingly, machine and human view the compression quality differently. Medical images compressed with good quality w.r.t. human vision may result in inferior segmentation accuracy. We then design a machine vision oriented 3D image compression framework tailored for segmentation using DNNs. Our method automatically extracts and retains image features that are most important to the segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on widely adopted segmentation frameworks with HVSMR 2016 challenge dataset show that our method can achieve significantly higher segmentation accuracy at the same compression rate, or much better compression rate under the same segmentation accuracy, when compared with the existing JPEG 2000 method. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first machine vision guided medical image compression framework for segmentation in the clouds.",0
"The popularity of cloud-based medical image analysis has increased due to the complex computations required by deep neural network (DNN) frameworks and the growing volume of medical images that need to be processed.

"Morphological reconstruction (MR) is often employed by seeded image segmentation algorithms such as watershed transform and power watershed as it is able to filter seeds (regional minima) to reduce over-segmentation. However, MR might mistakenly filter meaningful seeds that are required for generating accurate segmentation and it is also sensitive to the scale because a single-scale structuring element is employed. In this paper, a novel adaptive morphological reconstruction (AMR) operation is proposed that has three advantages. Firstly, AMR can adaptively filter useless seeds while preserving meaningful ones. Secondly, AMR is insensitive to the scale of structuring elements because multiscale structuring elements are employed. Finally, AMR has two attractive properties: monotonic increasingness and convergence that help seeded segmentation algorithms to achieve a hierarchical segmentation. Experiments clearly demonstrate that AMR is useful for improving algorithms of seeded image segmentation and seed-based spectral segmentation. Compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithms provide better segmentation results requiring less computing time.

"Image segmentation is an important task in many medical applications. Methods based on convolutional neural networks attain state-of-the-art accuracy; however, they typically rely on supervised training with large labeled datasets. Labeling medical images requires significant expertise and time, and typical hand-tuned approaches for data augmentation fail to capture the complex variations in such images.   We present an automated data augmentation method for synthesizing labeled medical images. We demonstrate our method on the task of segmenting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. Our method requires only a single segmented scan, and leverages other unlabeled scans in a semi-supervised approach. We learn a model of transformations from the images, and use the model along with the labeled example to synthesize additional labeled examples. Each transformation is comprised of a spatial deformation field and an intensity change, enabling the synthesis of complex effects such as variations in anatomy and image acquisition procedures.

"Referring object detection and referring image segmentation are important tasks that require joint understanding of visual information and natural language. Yet there has been evidence that current benchmark datasets suffer from bias, and current state-of-the-art models cannot be easily evaluated on their intermediate reasoning process. To address these issues and complement similar efforts in visual question answering, we build CLEVR-Ref+, a synthetic diagnostic dataset for referring expression comprehension. The precise locations and attributes of the objects are readily available, and the referring expressions are automatically associated with functional programs. The synthetic nature allows control over dataset bias (through sampling strategy), and the modular programs enable intermediate reasoning ground truth without human annotators.   In addition to evaluating several state-of-the-art models on CLEVR-Ref+, we also propose IEP-Ref, a module network approach that significantly outperforms other models on our dataset. In particular, we present two interesting and important findings using IEP-Ref: (1) the module trained to transform feature maps into segmentation masks can be attached to any intermediate module to reveal the entire reasoning process step-by-step; (2) even if all training data has at least one object referred, IEP-Ref can correctly predict no-foreground when presented with false-premise referring expressions.

"Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has successfully identified neural network architectures that exceed human designed ones on large-scale image classification. In this paper, we study NAS for semantic image segmentation. Existing works often focus on searching the repeatable cell structure, while hand-designing the outer network structure that controls the spatial resolution changes. This choice simplifies the search space, but becomes increasingly problematic for dense image prediction which exhibits a lot more network level architectural variations. Therefore, we propose to search the network level structure in addition to the cell level structure, which forms a hierarchical architecture search space. We present a network level search space that includes many popular designs, and develop a formulation that allows efficient gradient-based architecture search (3 P100 GPU days on Cityscapes images).

"The prevalence of skin melanoma is rapidly increasing as well as the recorded death cases of its patients. Automatic image segmentation tools play an important role in providing standardized computer-assisted analysis for skin melanoma patients. Current state-of-the-art segmentation methods are based on fully convolutional neural networks, which utilize an encoder-decoder approach.

"In applications of supervised learning applied to medical image segmentation, the need for large amounts of labeled data typically goes unquestioned. In particular, in the case of brain anatomy segmentation, hundreds or thousands of weakly-labeled volumes are often used as training data. In this paper, we first observe that for many brain structures, a small number of training examples, (n=9), weakly labeled using Freesurfer 6.0, plus simple data augmentation, suffice as training data to achieve high performance, achieving an overall mean Dice coefficient of $0.84 \pm 0.12$ compared to Freesurfer over 28 brain structures in T1-weighted images of $\approx 4000$ 9-10 year-olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. We then examine two varieties of heteroscedastic network as a method for improving classification results. An existing proposal by Kendall and Gal, which uses Monte-Carlo inference to learn to predict the variance of each prediction, yields an overall mean Dice of $0.85 \pm 0.14$ and showed statistically significant improvements over 25 brain structures. Meanwhile a novel heteroscedastic network which directly learns the probability that an example has been mislabeled yielded an overall mean Dice of $0.87 \pm 0.11$ and showed statistically significant improvements over all but one of the brain structures considered.

"We propose an active learning approach to image segmentation that exploits geometric priors to speed up and streamline the annotation process. It can be applied for both background-foreground and multi-class segmentation tasks in 2D images and 3D image volumes. Our approach combines geometric smoothness priors in the image space with more traditional uncertainty measures to estimate which pixels or voxels are the most informative, and thus should to be annotated next. For multi-class settings, we additionally introduce two novel criteria for uncertainty. In the 3D case, we use the resulting uncertainty measure to select voxels lying on a planar patch, which makes batch annotation much more convenient for the end user compared to the setting where voxels are randomly distributed in a volume. The planar patch is found using a branch-and-bound algorithm that looks for a 2D patch in a 3D volume where the most informative instances are located. We evaluate our approach on Electron Microscopy and Magnetic Resonance image volumes, as well as on regular images of horses and faces. We demonstrate a substantial performance increase over other approaches thanks to the use of geometric priors.",0

"We propose a method to classify cardiac pathology based on a novel approach to extract image derived features to characterize the shape and motion of the heart. An original semi-supervised learning procedure, which makes efficient use of a large amount of non-segmented images and a small amount of images segmented manually by experts, is developed to generate pixel-wise apparent flow between two time points of a 2D+t cine MRI image sequence. Combining the apparent flow maps and cardiac segmentation masks, we obtain a local apparent flow corresponding to the 2D motion of myocardium and ventricular cavities. This leads to the generation of time series of the radius and thickness of myocardial segments to represent cardiac motion. These time series of motion features are reliable and explainable characteristics of pathological cardiac motion. Furthermore, they are combined with shape-related features to classify cardiac pathologies. Using only nine feature values as input, we propose an explainable, simple and flexible model for pathology classification. On ACDC training set and testing set, the model achieves 95% and 94% respectively as classification accuracy. Its performance is hence comparable to that of the state-of-the-art.

"This paper presents a new approach for relatively accurate brain region of interest (ROI) detection from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) images of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy. Such images produce problems for automatic brain segmentation algorithms, and as a result, poor perfusion ROI detection affects both quantitative measurements and visual assessment of perfusion data. In the proposed approach image segmentation is based on CUSUM filter usage that was adapted to be applicable to process DSC perfusion MR images. The result of segmentation is a binary mask of brain ROI that is generated via usage of brain boundary location. Each point of the boundary between the brain and surrounding tissues is detected as a change-point by CUSUM filter. Proposed adopted CUSUM filter operates by accumulating the deviations between the observed and expected intensities of image points at the time of moving on a trajectory. Motion trajectory is created by the iterative change of movement direction inside the background region in order to reach brain region, and vice versa after boundary crossing. Proposed segmentation approach was evaluated with Dice index comparing obtained results to the reference standard. Manually marked brain region pixels (reference standard), as well as visual inspection of detected with CUSUM filter usage brain ROI, were provided by experienced radiologists. The results showed that proposed approach is suitable to be used for brain ROI detection from DSC perfusion MR images of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy and can, therefore, be applied in the DSC perfusion data analysis.",0

"Over the past few years, deep learning techniques have achieved tremendous success in many visual understanding tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and caption generation. Despite this thriving in computer vision and natural language processing, deep learning has not yet shown significant impact in robotics.

"In this paper we describe a new mobile architecture, MobileNetV2, that improves the state of the art performance of mobile models on multiple tasks and benchmarks as well as across a spectrum of different model sizes. We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.   The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters",0

"In this paper, we investigate how to learn a suitable representation of satellite image time series in an unsupervised manner by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data. Additionally , we aim to disentangle the representation of time series into two representations: a shared representation that captures the common information between the images of a time series and an exclusive representation that contains the specific information of each image of the time series. To address these issues, we propose a model that combines a novel component called cross-domain autoencoders with the variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative ad-versarial network (GAN) methods. In order to learn disentangled representations of time series, our model learns the multimodal image-to-image translation task.

"Image segmentation plays an essential role in medicine for both diagnostic and interventional tasks. Segmentation approaches are either manual, semi-automated or fully-automated. Manual segmentation offers full control over the quality of the results, but is tedious, time consuming and prone to operator bias. Fully automated methods require no human effort, but often deliver sub-optimal results without providing users with the means to make corrections. Semi-automated approaches keep users in control of the results by providing means for interaction, but the main challenge is to offer a good trade-off between precision and required interaction. In this paper we present a deep learning (DL) based semi-automated segmentation approach that aims to be a ""smart"" interactive tool for region of interest delineation in medical images. We demonstrate its use for segmenting multiple organs on computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen. Our approach solves some of the most pressing clinical challenges: (i) it requires only one to a few user clicks to deliver excellent 2D segmentations in a fast and reliable fashion; (ii) it can generalize to previously unseen structures and ""corner cases""; (iii) it delivers results that can be corrected quickly in a smart and intuitive way up to an arbitrary degree of precision chosen by the user and (iv) ensures high accuracy.

"Dilated Convolutions have been shown to be highly useful for the task of image segmentation. By introducing gaps into convolutional filters, they enable the use of larger receptive fields without increasing the original kernel size. Even though this allows for the inexpensive capturing of features at different scales, the structure of the dilated convolutional filter leads to a loss of information. We hypothesise that inexpensive modifications to Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks, such as additional averaging layers, could overcome this limitation. In this project we test this hypothesis by evaluating the effect of these modifications for a state-of-the art image segmentation system and compare them to existing approaches with the same objective. Our experiments show that our proposed methods improve the performance of dilated convolutions for image segmentation.

"Plant root research can provide a way to attain stress-tolerant crops that produce greater yield in a diverse array of conditions. Phenotyping roots in soil is often challenging due to the roots being difficult to access and the use of time consuming manual methods. Rhizotrons allow visual inspection of root growth through transparent surfaces. Agronomists currently manually label photographs of roots obtained from rhizotrons using a line-intersect method to obtain root length density and rooting depth measurements which are essential for their experiments. We investigate the effectiveness of an automated image segmentation method based on the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to enable such measurements. We design a data-set of 50 annotated Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) root images which we use to train, validate and test the system and compare against a baseline built using the Frangi vesselness filter. We obtain metrics using manual annotations and line-intersect counts. Our results on the held out data show our proposed automated segmentation system to be a viable solution for detecting and quantifying roots.

"A fully automated knee MRI segmentation method to study osteoarthritis (OA) was developed using a novel hierarchical set of random forests (RF) classifiers to learn the appearance of cartilage regions and their boundaries. A neighborhood approximation forest is used first to provide contextual feature to the second-level RF classifier that also considers local features and produces location-specific costs for the layered optimal graph image segmentation of multiple objects and surfaces (LOGISMOS) framework. Double echo steady state (DESS) MRIs used in this work originated from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study. Trained on 34 MRIs with varying degrees of OA, the performance of the learning-based method tested on 108 MRIs showed a significant reduction in segmentation errors (\emph{p}$<$0.05) compared with the conventional gradient-based and single-stage RF-learned costs. The 3D LOGISMOS was extended to longitudinal-3D (4D) to simultaneously segment multiple follow-up visits of the same patient. As such, data from all time-points of the temporal sequence contribute information to a single optimal solution that utilizes both spatial 3D and temporal contexts. 4D LOGISMOS validation on 108 MRIs from baseline and 12 month follow-up scans of 54 patients showed a significant reduction in segmentation errors (\emph{p}$<$0.01) compared to 3D.

"Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently dominate competitions on image segmentation, for neuroimaging analysis tasks, more classical generative approaches based on mixture models are still used in practice to parcellate brains. To bridge the gap between the two, in this paper we propose a marriage between a probabilistic generative model, which has been shown to be robust to variability among magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired via different imaging protocols, and a CNN. The link is in the prior distribution over the unknown tissue classes, which are classically modelled using a Markov random field. In this work we model the interactions among neighbouring pixels by a type of recurrent CNN, which can encode more complex spatial interactions. We validate our proposed model on publicly available MR data, from different centres, and show that it generalises across imaging protocols. This result demonstrates a successful and principled inclusion of a CNN in a generative model, which in turn could be adapted by any probabilistic generative approach for image segmentation.",0

"We present an approach for fully automatic urinary bladder segmentation in CT images with artificial neural networks in this study. Automatic medical image analysis has become an invaluable tool in the different treatment stages of diseases.

"Medical image segmentation is an important step in medical image analysis. With the rapid development of convolutional neural network in image processing, deep learning has been used for medical image segmentation, such as optic disc segmentation, blood vessel detection, lung segmentation, cell segmentation, etc. Previously, U-net based approaches have been proposed.

"Difficult image segmentation problems, for instance left atrium MRI, can be addressed by incorporating shape priors to find solutions that are consistent with known objects. Nonetheless, a single multivariate Gaussian is not an adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the prior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more general, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious challenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces. Here, we propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use deep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding the careful selection of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional subspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a latent variable and marginalize it within a generalized expectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional maximization-based scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and an intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a nonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties. We demonstrate our approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is useful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation.",0

"Accurate segmentation of brain tissue in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a diffcult task due to different types of brain abnormalities. Using information and features from multimodal MRI including T1, T1-weighted inversion recovery (T1-IR) and T2-FLAIR and differential geometric features including the Jacobian determinant(JD) and the curl vector(CV) derived from T1 modality can result in a more accurate analysis of brain images. In this paper, we use the differential geometric information including JD and CV as image characteristics to measure the differences between different MRI images, which represent local size changes and local rotations of the brain image, and we can use them as one CNN channel with other three modalities (T1-weighted, T1-IR and T2-FLAIR) to get more accurate results of brain segmentation. We test this method on two datasets including IBSR dataset and MRBrainS datasets based on the deep voxelwise residual network, namely VoxResNet, and obtain excellent improvement over single modality or three modalities and increases average DSC(Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM)) by about 1.5% on the well-known MRBrainS18 dataset and about 2.5% on the IBSR dataset.

"Human motion capture data has been widely used in data-driven character animation. In order to generate realistic, natural-looking motions, most data-driven approaches require considerable efforts of pre-processing, including motion segmentation and annotation. Existing (semi-) automatic solutions either require hand-crafted features for motion segmentation or do not produce the semantic annotations required for motion synthesis and building large-scale motion databases. In addition, human labeled annotation data suffers from inter- and intra-labeler inconsistencies by design. We propose a semi-automatic framework for semantic segmentation of motion capture data based on supervised machine learning techniques. It first transforms a motion capture sequence into a ``motion image'' and applies a convolutional neural network for image segmentation. Dilated temporal convolutions enable the extraction of temporal information from a large receptive field. Our model outperforms two state-of-the-art models for action segmentation, as well as a popular network for sequence modeling.

"The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the difficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level annotations. Most methods based on image-level annotations use localization maps obtained from the classifier, but these only focus on the small discriminative parts of objects and do not capture precise boundaries. FickleNet explores diverse combinations of locations on feature maps created by generic deep neural networks. It selects hidden units randomly and then uses them to obtain activation scores for image classification. FickleNet implicitly learns the coherence of each location in the feature maps, resulting in a localization map which identifies both discriminative and other parts of objects. The ensemble effects are obtained from a single network by selecting random hidden unit pairs, which means that a variety of localization maps are generated from a single image. Our approach does not require any additional training steps and only adds a simple layer to a standard convolutional neural network; nevertheless it outperforms recent comparable techniques on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark in both weakly and semi-supervised settings.",0

Our approach is simple, requiring only a standard convolutional neural network with an added layer, and outperforms other comparable techniques on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark in both weakly and semi-supervised settings without any additional training steps. Additionally, our method generates a variety of localization maps from a single network through random hidden unit pair selections.",1
"Recently, dense connections have attracted substantial attention in computer vision because they facilitate gradient flow and implicit deep supervision during training. Particularly, DenseNet, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion, has shown impressive performances in natural image classification tasks. We propose HyperDenseNet, a 3D fully convolutional neural network that extends the definition of dense connectivity to multi-modal segmentation problems. Each imaging modality has a path, and dense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same path, but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the existing multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities relies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion, typically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the proposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between the modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which increases significantly the learning representation. We report extensive evaluations over two different and highly competitive multi-modal brain tissue segmentation challenges, iSEG 2017 and MRBrainS 2013, with the former focusing on 6-month infant data and the latter on adult images. HyperDenseNet yielded significant improvements over many state-of-the-art segmentation networks, ranking at the top on both benchmarks. We further provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of features re-use, which confirms the importance of hyper-dense connections in multi-modal representation learning. Our code is publicly available at https://www.github.com/josedolz/HyperDenseNet.",0

"Supervised training a deep neural network aims to ""teach"" the network to mimic human visual perception that is represented by image-and-label pairs in the training data. Superpixelized (SP) images are visually perceivable to humans, but a conventionally trained deep learning model often performs poorly when working on SP images. To better mimic human visual perception, we think it is desirable for the deep learning model to be able to perceive not only raw images but also SP images. In this paper, we propose a new superpixel-based data augmentation (SPDA) method for training deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation. Our method applies a superpixel generation scheme to all the original training images to generate superpixelized images. The SP images thus obtained are then jointly used with the original training images to train a deep learning model. Our experiments of SPDA on four biomedical image datasets show that SPDA is effective and can consistently improve the performance of state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation in 2D and 3D images. Additional studies also demonstrate that SPDA can practically reduce the generalization gap.",0
"The objective of supervised training for a deep neural network is to instruct the network to imitate human vision by utilizing image-and-label pairs in the training data.

"Various saliency detection algorithms from color images have been proposed to mimic eye fixation or attentive object detection response of human observers for the same scenes. However, developments on hyperspectral imaging systems enable us to obtain redundant spectral information of the observed scenes from the reflected light source from objects. A few studies using low-level features on hyperspectral images demonstrated that salient object detection can be achieved. In this work, we proposed a salient object detection model on hyperspectral images by applying manifold ranking (MR) on self-supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features (high-level features) from unsupervised image segmentation task. Self-supervision of CNN continues until clustering loss or saliency maps converges to a defined error between each iteration. Finally, saliency estimations is done as the saliency map at last iteration when the self-supervision procedure terminates with convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that proposed saliency detection algorithm on hyperspectral images is outperforming state-of-the-arts hyperspectral saliency models including the original MR based saliency model.",0

"This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an image segment, given a pixel within this segment region. The net receives an image, a point in the image and a region of interest (RoI ) mask. The net output is a binary mask of the segment in which the point is located. The region where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask. Full image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially, region-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single segmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image segmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in the training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things) and non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer pixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that covers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky region, the net returns the region of the sky in the image. This is true even if no example for sky or person appeared in the training set. The net was tested and trained on the COCO panoptic dataset and achieved 67% IOU for segmentation of familiar classes (that were part of the net training set) and 53% IOU for segmentation of unfamiliar classes (that were not included in the training).",0

"Dense 3D visual mapping estimates as many as possible pixel depths, for each image. This results in very dense point clouds that often contain redundant and noisy information, especially for surfaces that are roughly planar, for instance, the ground or the walls in the scene. In this paper we leverage on semantic image segmentation to discriminate which regions of the scene require simplification and which should be kept at high level of details. We propose four different point cloud simplification methods which decimate the perceived point cloud by relying on class-specific local and global statistics still maintaining more points in the proximity of class boundaries to preserve the infra-class edges and discontinuities. 3D dense model is obtained by fusing the point clouds in a 3D Delaunay Triangulation to deal with variable point cloud density. In the experimental evaluation we have shown that, by leveraging on semantics, it is possible to simplify the model and diminish the noise affecting the point clouds.",0

"Segmentation of colorectal cancerous regions from 3D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is a crucial procedure for radiotherapy which conventionally requires accurate delineation of tumour boundaries at an expense of labor, time and reproducibility. While deep learning based methods serve good baselines in 3D image segmentation tasks, small applicable patch size limits effective receptive field and degrades segmentation performance. In addition, Regions of interest (RoIs) localization from large whole volume 3D images serves as a preceding operation that brings about multiple benefits in terms of speed, target completeness, reduction of false positives. Distinct from sliding window or non-joint localization-segmentation based models, we propose a novel multitask framework referred to as 3D RoI-aware U-Net (3D RU-Net), for RoI localization and in-region segmentation where the two tasks share one backbone encoder network. With the region proposals from the encoder, we crop multi-level RoI in-region features from the encoder to form a GPU memory-efficient decoder for detailpreserving segmentation and therefore enlarged applicable volume size and effective receptive field. To effectively train the model, we designed a Dice formulated loss function for the global-to-local multi-task learning procedure. Based on the efficiency gains, we went on to ensemble models with different receptive fields to achieve even higher performance costing minor extra computational expensiveness. Extensive experiments were conducted on 64 cancerous cases with a four-fold cross-validation, and the results showed significant superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency over conventional frameworks. In conclusion, the proposed method has a huge potential for extension to other 3D object segmentation tasks from medical images due to its inherent generalizability.

"Optimal surface segmentation is a state-of-the-art method used for segmentation of multiple globally optimal surfaces in volumetric datasets. The method is widely used in numerous medical image segmentation applications. However, nodes in the graph based optimal surface segmentation method typically encode uniformly distributed orthogonal voxels of the volume. Thus the segmentation cannot attain an accuracy greater than a single unit voxel, i.e. the distance between two adjoining nodes in graph space. Segmentation accuracy higher than a unit voxel is achievable by exploiting partial volume information in the voxels which shall result in non-equidistant spacing between adjoining graph nodes. This paper reports a generalized graph based multiple surface segmentation method with convex priors which can optimally segment the target surfaces in an irregularly sampled space. The proposed method allows non-equidistant spacing between the adjoining graph nodes to achieve subvoxel segmentation accuracy by utilizing the partial volume information in the voxels. The partial volume information in the voxels is exploited by computing a displacement field from the original volume data to identify the subvoxel-accurate centers within each voxel resulting in non-equidistant spacing between the adjoining graph nodes. The smoothness of each surface modeled as a convex constraint governs the connectivity and regularity of the surface. We employ an edge-based graph representation to incorporate the necessary constraints and the globally optimal solution is obtained by computing a minimum s-t cut. The proposed method was validated on 10 intravascular multi-frame ultrasound image datasets for subvoxel segmentation accuracy. In all cases, the approach yielded highly accurate results. Our approach can be readily extended to higher-dimensional segmentations.",0

"Medical image segmentation being a substantial component of image processing plays a significant role to analyze gross anatomy, to locate an infirmity and to plan the surgical procedures.

"Deep convolutional networks have achieved the state-of-the-art for semantic image segmentation tasks. However, training these networks requires access to densely labeled images, which are known to be very expensive to obtain. On the other hand, the web provides an almost unlimited source of images annotated at the image level. How can one utilize this much larger weakly annotated set for tasks that require dense labeling? Prior work often relied on localization cues, such as saliency maps, objectness priors, bounding boxes etc., to address this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a model that generates auxiliary labels for each image, while simultaneously forcing the output of the CNN to satisfy the mean-field constraints imposed by a conditional random field. We show that one can enforce the CRF constraints by forcing the distribution at each pixel to be close to the distribution of its neighbors. This is in stark contrast with methods that compute a recursive expansion of the mean-field distribution using a recurrent architecture and train the resultant distribution. Instead, the proposed model adds an extra loss term to the output of the CNN, and hence, is faster than recursive implementations. We achieve the state-of-the-art for weakly supervised semantic image segmentation on VOC 2012 dataset, assuming no manually labeled pixel level information is available. Furthermore, the incorporation of conditional random fields in CNN incurs little extra time during training.",0

"The instance segmentation problem intends to precisely detect and delineate objects in images.

"In the deep metric learning approach to image segmentation, a convolutional net densely generates feature vectors at the pixels of an image. Pairs of feature vectors are trained to be similar or different, depending on whether the corresponding pixels belong to same or different ground truth segments. To segment a new image, the feature vectors are computed and clustered. Both empirically and theoretically, it is unclear whether or when deep metric learning is superior to the more conventional approach of directly predicting an affinity graph with a convolutional net. We compare the two approaches using brain images from serial section electron microscopy images, which constitute an especially challenging example of instance segmentation. We first show that seed-based postprocessing of the feature vectors, as originally proposed, produces inferior accuracy because it is difficult for the convolutional net to predict feature vectors that remain uniform across large objects. Then we consider postprocessing by thresholding a nearest neighbor graph followed by connected components. In this case, segmentations from a ""metric graph"" turn out to be competitive or even superior to segmentations from a directly predicted affinity graph. To explain these findings theoretically, we invoke the property that the metric function satisfies the triangle inequality. Then we show with an example where this constraint suppresses noise, causing connected components to more robustly segment a metric graph than an unconstrained affinity graph.",0

"Despite the state-of-the-art performance for medical image segmentation, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have rarely provided uncertainty estimations regarding their segmentation outputs, e.g., model (epistemic) and image-based (aleatoric) uncertainties. In this work, we analyze these different types of uncertainties for CNN-based 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. We additionally propose a test-time augmentation-based aleatoric uncertainty to analyze the effect of different transformations of the input image on the segmentation output. Test-time augmentation has been previously used to improve segmentation accuracy, yet not been formulated in a consistent mathematical framework. Hence, we also propose a theoretical formulation of test-time augmentation, where a distribution of the prediction is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation with prior distributions of parameters in an image acquisition model that involves image transformations and noise. We compare and combine our proposed aleatoric uncertainty with model uncertainty. Experiments with segmentation of fetal brains and brain tumors from 2D and 3D Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) showed that 1) the test-time augmentation-based aleatoric uncertainty provides a better uncertainty estimation than calculating the test-time dropout-based model uncertainty alone and helps to reduce overconfident incorrect predictions, and 2) our test-time augmentation outperforms a single-prediction baseline and dropout-based multiple predictions.",0

"Current state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation methods have not yet made a broad entrance into the clinical setting in spite of high demand for such automatic methods.

This paper presents an automatic image segmentation method based on (Bayesian) dilated convolutional networks (DCNN) that generate segmentation masks and spatial uncertainty maps for the input image at hand. The method was trained and evaluated using segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) cavity, right ventricle (RV) endocardium and myocardium (Myo) at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) in 100 cardiac 2D MR scans from the MICCAI 2017 Challenge (ACDC). Combining segmentations and uncertainty maps and employing a human-in-the-loop setting, we provide evidence that image areas indicated as highly uncertain regarding the obtained segmentation almost entirely cover regions of incorrect segmentations. The fused information can be harnessed to increase segmentation performance. Our results reveal that we can obtain valuable spatial uncertainty maps with low computational effort using DCNNs.",0
"Despite the high demand for automated segmentation methods in the clinical setting, current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques have not yet been widely adopted due to their lack of reliability. These models often generate anatomically implausible results that go unnoticed, making them unsuitable for medical experts. This paper introduces an automatic image segmentation method that uses Bayesian dilated convolutional networks (DCNN) to produce segmentation masks and spatial uncertainty maps for a given input image.

By combining segmentations and uncertainty maps, and applying a human-in-the-loop approach, we demonstrate that highly uncertain areas correspond to regions of incorrect segmentations. This combined information can be leveraged to improve segmentation accuracy, with valuable spatial uncertainty maps obtainable through low computational effort using DCNNs.",1
"Background: The trend towards large-scale studies including population imaging poses new challenges in terms of quality control (QC). This is a particular issue when automatic processing tools, e.g. image segmentation methods, are employed to derive quantitative measures or biomarkers for later analyses. Manual inspection and visual QC of each segmentation isn't feasible at large scale. However, it's important to be able to automatically detect when a segmentation method fails so as to avoid inclusion of wrong measurements into subsequent analyses which could lead to incorrect conclusions. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we explore an approach for predicting segmentation quality based on Reverse Classification Accuracy, which enables us to discriminate between successful and failed segmentations on a per-cases basis. We validate this approach on a new, large-scale manually-annotated set of 4,800 cardiac magnetic resonance scans. We then apply our method to a large cohort of 7,250 cardiac MRI on which we have performed manual QC. Results: We report results used for predicting segmentation quality metrics including Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and surface-distance measures. As initial validation, we present data for 400 scans demonstrating 99% accuracy for classifying low and high quality segmentations using predicted DSC scores. As further validation we show high correlation between real and predicted scores and 95% classification accuracy on 4,800 scans for which manual segmentations were available. We mimic real-world application of the method on 7,250 cardiac MRI where we show good agreement between predicted quality metrics and manual visual QC scores. Conclusions: We show that RCA has the potential for accurate and fully automatic segmentation QC on a per-case basis in the context of large-scale population imaging as in the UK Biobank Imaging Study.",0

"Recently, state-of-the-art results have been achieved in semantic segmentation using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Most of these networks employ encoder-decoder style architecture similar to U-Net and are trained with images and the corresponding segmentation maps as a pixel-wise classification task. Such frameworks only exploit class information by using the ground truth segmentation maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework with the main aim of exploiting structural and spatial information along with the class information. We modify the decoder part of the FCN to exploit class information and the structural information as well. We intend to do this while also keeping the parameters of the network as low as possible. We obtain the structural information using either of the two ways: i) using the contour map and ii) using the distance map, both of which can be obtained from ground truth segmentation maps with no additional annotation costs. We also explore different ways in which distance maps can be computed and study the effects of different distance maps on the segmentation performance. We also experiment extensively on two different medical image segmentation applications: i.e i) using color fundus images for optic disc and cup segmentation and ii) using endoscopic images for polyp segmentation. Through our experiments, we report results comparable to, and in some cases performing better than the current state-of-the-art architectures and with an order of 2x reduction in the number of parameters.",0

"Image-to-image translation is a long-established and a difficult problem in computer vision. In this paper we propose an adversarial based model for image-to-image translation. The regular deep neural-network based methods perform the task of image-to-image translation by comparing gram matrices and using image segmentation which requires human intervention. Our generative adversarial network based model works on a conditional probability approach. This approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and content or style features. In our approach we use a bidirectional reconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in conserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The advantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is semi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties of generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method has proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image translation.",0

"A class of vision problems, less commonly studied, consists of detecting objects in imagery obtained from physics-based experiments. These objects can span in 4D (x, y, z, t) and are visible as disturbances (caused due to physical phenomena) in the image with background distribution being approximately uniform. Such objects, occasionally referred to as `events', can be considered as high energy blobs in the image. Unlike the images analyzed in conventional vision problems, very limited features are associated with such events, and their shape, size and count can vary significantly. This poses a challenge on the use of pre-trained models obtained from supervised approaches.   In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach involving iterative clustering based segmentation (ICS) which can detect target objects (events) in real-time. In this approach, a test image is analyzed over several cycles, and one event is identified per cycle. Each cycle consists of the following steps: (1) image segmentation using a modified k-means clustering method, (2) elimination of empty (with no events) segments based on statistical analysis of each segment, (3) merging segments that overlap (correspond to same event), and (4) selecting the strongest event. These four steps are repeated until all the events have been identified. The ICS approach consists of a few hyper-parameters that have been chosen based on statistical study performed over a set of test images. The applicability of ICS method is demonstrated on several 2D and 3D test examples.",0

"Ultrasound image compression by preserving speckle-based key information is a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce an ultrasound image compression framework with the ability to retain realism of speckle appearance despite achieving very high-density compression factors. The compressor employs a tissue segmentation method, transmitting segments along with transducer frequency, number of samples and image size as essential information required for decompression. The decompressor is based on a convolutional network trained to generate patho-realistic ultrasound images which convey essential information pertinent to tissue pathology visible in the images. We demonstrate generalizability of the building blocks using two variants to build the compressor. We have evaluated the quality of decompressed images using distortion losses as well as perception loss and compared it with other off the shelf solutions. The proposed method achieves a compression ratio of $725:1$ while preserving the statistical distribution of speckles. This enables image segmentation on decompressed images to achieve dice score of $0.89 \pm 0.11$, which evidently is not so accurately achievable when images are compressed with current standards like JPEG, JPEG 2000, WebP and BPG. We envision this frame work to serve as a roadmap for speckle image compression standards.",0

"The Encoder-Decoder architecture is a main stream deep learning model for biomedical image segmentation. The encoder fully compresses the input and generates encoded features, and the decoder then produces dense predictions using encoded features. However, decoders are still under-explored in such architectures. In this paper, we comprehensively study the state-of-the-art Encoder-Decoder architectures, and propose a new universal decoder, called cascade decoder, to improve semantic segmentation accuracy. Our cascade decoder can be embedded into existing networks and trained altogether in an end-to-end fashion. The cascade decoder structure aims to conduct more effective decoding of hierarchically encoded features and is more compatible with common encoders than the known decoders. We replace the decoders of state-of-the-art models with our cascade decoder for several challenging biomedical image segmentation tasks, and the considerable improvements achieved demonstrate the efficacy of our new decoding method.",0

"Photorealism is a complex concept that cannot easily be formulated mathematically. Deep Photo Style Transfer is an attempt to transfer the style of a reference image to a content image while preserving its photorealism. This is achieved by introducing a constraint that prevents distortions in the content image and by applying the style transfer independently for semantically different parts of the images. In addition, an automated segmentation process is presented that consists of a neural network based segmentation method followed by a semantic grouping step. To further improve the results a measure for image aesthetics is used and elaborated. If the content and the style image are sufficiently similar, the result images look very realistic. With the automation of the image segmentation the pipeline becomes completely independent from any user interaction, which allows for new applications.",0

"Recent advances in deep learning methods have come to define the state-of-the-art for many medical imaging applications, surpassing even human judgment in several tasks. Those models, however, when trained to reduce the empirical risk on a single domain, fail to generalize when applied to other domains, a very common scenario in medical imaging due to the variability of images and anatomical structures, even across the same imaging modality. In this work, we extend the method of unsupervised domain adaptation using self-ensembling for the semantic segmentation task and explore multiple facets of the method on a small and realistic publicly-available magnetic resonance (MRI) dataset. Through an extensive evaluation, we show that self-ensembling can indeed improve the generalization of the models even when using a small amount of unlabelled data.",0

"In recent years, deep learning has shown performance breakthroughs in many applications, such as image detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and speech recognition. However, this comes with a major concern: deep networks have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are slightly modified inputs that are intentionally designed to cause a misclassification by the model. In the domains of images and speech, the modifications are so small that they are not seen or heard by humans, but nevertheless greatly affect the classification of the model.   Deep learning models have been successfully applied to malware detection. In this domain, generating adversarial examples is not straightforward, as small modifications to the bytes of the file could lead to significant changes in its functionality and validity. We introduce a novel loss function for generating adversarial examples specifically tailored for discrete input sets, such as executable bytes. We modify malicious binaries so that they would be detected as benign, while preserving their original functionality, by injecting a small sequence of bytes (payload) in the binary file. We applied this approach to an end-to-end convolutional deep learning malware detection model and show a high rate of detection evasion. Moreover, we show that our generated payload is robust enough to be transferable within different locations of the same file and across different files, and that its entropy is low and similar to that of benign data sections.",0
"Deep learning has exhibited remarkable performance advancements in various applications, including image detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and speech recognition. Nevertheless, there is a significant concern that deep networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are slightly altered inputs intended to cause a model to misclassify.

In malware detection, generating adversarial examples can be challenging because minor modifications to the file's bytes can have a significant impact on functionality and validity. To address this issue, we devised a new loss function for generating adversarial examples that target discrete input sets, such as executable bytes. By injecting a small byte sequence (payload) into a malicious binary file, we can modify it to be detected as benign while preserving its original functionality. Our approach was applied to a convolutional deep learning malware detection model, resulting in a high evasion detection rate. Additionally, we discovered that our generated payload was transferable within different file locations and across diverse files. Its entropy was also low and comparable to that of benign data sections.",1
"In order to identify and prevent tea leaf diseases effectively, convolution neural network (CNN) was used to realize the image recognition of tea disease leaves. Firstly, image segmentation and data enhancement are used to preprocess the images, and then these images were input into the network for training. Secondly, to reach a higher recognition accuracy of CNN, the learning rate and iteration numbers were adjusted frequently and the dropout was added properly in the case of over-fitting. Finally, the experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of CNN is 93.75%, while the accuracy of SVM and BP neural network is 89.36% and 87.69% respectively. Therefore, the recognition algorithm based on CNN is better in classification and can improve the recognition efficiency of tea leaf diseases effectively.",0

"Interactive image segmentation is a topic of many studies in image processing. In a conventional approach, a user marks some pixels of the object(s) of interest and background, and an algorithm propagates these labels to the rest of the image. This paper presents a new graph-based method for interactive segmentation with two stages. In the first stage, nodes representing pixels are connected to their $k$-nearest neighbors to build a complex network with the small-world property to propagate the labels quickly. In the second stage, a regular network in a grid format is used to refine the segmentation on the object borders. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can perform the task with high accuracy. Computer simulations are performed using some real-world images to show its effectiveness in both two-classes and multi-classes problems. It is also applied to all the images from the Microsoft GrabCut dataset for comparison, and the segmentation accuracy is comparable to those achieved by some state-of-the-art methods, while it is faster than them. In particular, it outperforms some recent approaches when the user input is composed only by a few ""scribbles"" draw over the objects. Its computational complexity is only linear on the image size at the best-case scenario and linearithmic in the worst case.",0

"Optimal decision making with limited or no information in stochastic environments where multiple agents interact is a challenging topic in the realm of artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular approach for arriving at optimal strategies by predicating stimuli, such as the reward for following a strategy, on experience.

"This paper offers three new, open-source, deep learning-based iris segmentation methods, and the methodology how to use irregular segmentation masks in a conventional Gabor-wavelet-based iris recognition.

"Preparation of high-quality datasets for the urban scene understanding is a labor-intensive task, especially, for datasets designed for the autonomous driving applications. The application of the coarse ground truth (GT) annotations of these datasets without detriment to the accuracy of semantic image segmentation (by the mean intersection over union - mIoU) could simplify and speedup the dataset preparation and model fine tuning before its practical application. Here the results of the comparative analysis for semantic segmentation accuracy obtained by PSPNet deep learning architecture are presented for fine and coarse annotated images from Cityscapes dataset. Two scenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and prediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT images for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most important classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for coarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard deviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some unimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some classes and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the accuracy even. Moreover, this opens the perspectives to use deep neural networks for the preparation of such coarse GT datasets.",0

"For medical image segmentation, most fully convolutional networks (FCNs) need strong supervision through a large sample of high-quality dense segmentations, which is taxing in terms of costs, time and logistics involved. This burden of annotation can be alleviated by exploiting weak inexpensive annotations such as bounding boxes and anatomical landmarks. However, it is very difficult to \textit{a priori} estimate the optimal balance between the number of annotations needed for each supervision type that leads to maximum performance with the least annotation cost. To optimize this cost-performance trade off, we present a budget-based cost-minimization framework in a mixed-supervision setting via dense segmentations, bounding boxes, and landmarks. We propose a linear programming (LP) formulation combined with uncertainty and similarity based ranking strategy to judiciously select samples to be annotated next for optimal performance. In the results section, we show that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches with significantly reduced cost of annotations.",0

"Recently there has been a lot of work on pruning filters from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the intention of reducing computations.The key idea is to rank the filters based on a certain criterion (say, l1-norm) and retain only the top ranked filters. Once the low scoring filters are pruned away the remainder of the network is fine tuned and is shown to give performance comparable to the original unpruned network. In this work, we report experiments which suggest that the comparable performance of the pruned network is not due to the specific criterion chosen but due to the inherent plasticity of deep neural networks which allows them to recover from the loss of pruned filters once the rest of the filters are fine-tuned. Specifically we show counter-intuitive results wherein by randomly pruning 25-50% filters from deep CNNs we are able to obtain the same performance as obtained by using state-of-the-art pruning methods. We empirically validate our claims by doing an exhaustive evaluation with VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We also evaluate a real world scenario where a CNN trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes needs to be tested on only a small set of classes at test time (say, only animals). We create a new benchmark dataset from ImageNet to evaluate such class specific pruning and show that even here a random pruning strategy gives close to state-of-the-art performance. Unlike existing approaches which mainly focus on the task of image classification, in this work we also report results on object detection and image segmentation. We show that using a simple random pruning strategy we can achieve significant speed up in object detection (74% improvement in fps) while retaining the same accuracy as that of the original Faster RCNN model. Similarly we show that the performance of a pruned Segmentation Network (SegNet) is actually very similar to that of the original unpruned SegNet.",0
"Recently, there has been a lot of research focused on decreasing computations in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by removing filters through pruning. The method involves ranking filters according to a criterion, such as l1-norm, and keeping only the top-ranked filters. After pruning out low-scoring filters, the rest of the network is fine-tuned and found to perform similarly to the original unpruned network. Our study challenges the notion that the comparable performance of pruned networks is a result of the specific criterion used. Instead, we suggest that the plasticity of deep neural networks allows them to recover from the loss of pruned filters once the rest of the filters are fine-tuned. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that randomly pruning 25-50% of filters from deep CNNs can yield the same performance as state-of-the-art pruning methods. Our claims are empirically validated through exhaustive evaluations with VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We also evaluate the effectiveness of random pruning in a real-world scenario where CNNs are trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes but tested on a limited set of classes, such as animals. A new benchmark dataset is created from ImageNet to evaluate class-specific pruning, and we show that even in this scenario, random pruning performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods. Unlike existing approaches that focus mainly on image classification, we report results on object detection and image segmentation, demonstrating that simple random pruning can significantly speed up object detection (74% improvement in fps) while maintaining the accuracy of the original Faster RCNN model. Additionally, we show that pruned Segmentation Networks (SegNets) perform similarly to the unpruned version.",1
"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many different 2D medical image analysis tasks. In clinical practice, however, a large part of the medical imaging data available is in 3D. This has motivated the development of 3D CNNs for volumetric image segmentation in order to benefit from more spatial context. Due to GPU memory restrictions caused by moving to fully 3D, state-of-the-art methods depend on subvolume/patch processing and the size of the input patch is usually small, limiting the incorporation of larger context information for a better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Holistic Decomposition Convolution (HDC), for an effective and efficient semantic segmentation of volumetric images. HDC consists of a periodic down-shuffling operation followed by a conventional 3D convolution. HDC has the advantage of significantly reducing the size of the data for sub-sequential processing while using all the information available in the input irrespective of the down-shuffling factors. Results obtained from comprehensive experiments conducted on hip T1 MR images and intervertebral disc T2 MR images demonstrate the efficacy of the present approach.",0

"This paper presents a ""learning to learn"" approach to figure-ground image segmentation. By exploring webly-abundant images of specific visual effects, our method can effectively learn the visual-effect internal representations in an unsupervised manner and uses this knowledge to differentiate the figure from the ground in an image. Specifically, we formulate the meta-learning process as a compositional image editing task that learns to imitate a certain visual effect and derive the corresponding internal representation. Such a generative process can help instantiate the underlying figure-ground notion and enables the system to accomplish the intended image segmentation. Whereas existing generative methods are mostly tailored to image synthesis or style transfer, our approach offers a flexible learning mechanism to model a general concept of figure-ground segmentation from unorganized images that have no explicit pixel-level annotations. We validate our approach via extensive experiments on six datasets to demonstrate that the proposed model can be end-to-end trained without ground-truth pixel labeling yet outperforms the existing methods of unsupervised segmentation tasks.",0

"Deep neural network models used for medical image segmentation are large because they are trained with high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely used to accelerate the trainings. However, the memory on a GPU is not large enough to train the models. A popular approach to tackling this problem is patch-based method, which divides a large image into small patches and trains the models with these small patches. However, this method would degrade the segmentation quality if a target object spans multiple patches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for 3D medical image segmentation that utilizes the data-swapping, which swaps out intermediate data from GPU memory to CPU memory to enlarge the effective GPU memory size, for training high-resolution 3D medical images without patching. We carefully tuned parameters in the data-swapping method to obtain the best training performance for 3D U-Net, a widely used deep neural network model for medical image segmentation. We applied our tuning to train 3D U-Net with full-size images of 192 x 192 x 192 voxels in brain tumor dataset. As a result, communication overhead, which is the most important issue, was reduced by 17.1%. Compared with the patch-based method for patches of 128 x 128 x 128 voxels, our training for full-size images achieved improvement on the mean Dice score by 4.48% and 5.32 % for detecting whole tumor sub-region and tumor core sub-region, respectively. The total training time was reduced from 164 hours to 47 hours, resulting in 3.53 times of acceleration.",0

"Interactive image segmentation algorithms rely on the user to provide annotations as the guidance. When the task of interactive segmentation is performed on a small touchscreen device, the requirement of providing precise annotations could be cumbersome to the user. We design an efficient seed proposal method that actively proposes annotation seeds for the user to label. The user only needs to check which ones of the query seeds are inside the region of interest (ROI). We enforce the sparsity and diversity criteria on the selection of the query seeds. At each round of interaction the user is only presented with a small number of informative query seeds that are far apart from each other. As a result, we are able to derive a user friendly interaction mechanism for annotation on small touchscreen devices. The user merely has to swipe through on the ROI-relevant query seeds, which should be easy since those gestures are commonly used on a touchscreen. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated on six publicly available datasets. The evaluation results show that our algorithm achieves high segmentation accuracy, with short response time and less user feedback.",0

"We propose an end-to-end learning framework for segmenting generic objects in both images and videos. Given a novel image or video, our approach produces a pixel-level mask for all ""object-like"" regions---even for object categories never seen during training. We formulate the task as a structured prediction problem of assigning an object/background label to each pixel, implemented using a deep fully convolutional network. When applied to a video, our model further incorporates a motion stream, and the network learns to combine both appearance and motion and attempts to extract all prominent objects whether they are moving or not. Beyond the core model, a second contribution of our approach is how it leverages varying strengths of training annotations. Pixel-level annotations are quite difficult to obtain, yet crucial for training a deep network approach for segmentation. Thus we propose ways to exploit weakly labeled data for learning dense foreground segmentation. For images, we show the value in mixing object category examples with image-level labels together with relatively few images with boundary-level annotations. For video, we show how to bootstrap weakly annotated videos together with the network trained for image segmentation. Through experiments on multiple challenging image and video segmentation benchmarks, our method offers consistently strong results and improves the state-of-the-art for fully automatic segmentation of generic (unseen) objects. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach benefits image retrieval and image retargeting, both of which flourish when given our high-quality foreground maps.

"Markov Random Fields (MRFs) are a popular model for several pattern recognition and reconstruction problems in robotics and computer vision. Inference in MRFs is intractable in general and related work resorts to approximation algorithms. Among those techniques, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been shown to provide accurate estimates while scaling poorly with the problem size and being typically slow for practical applications. Our first contribution is to design a dual ascent method to solve standard SDP relaxations that takes advantage of the geometric structure of the problem to speed up computation. This technique, named Dual Ascent Riemannian Staircase (DARS), is able to solve large problem instances in seconds. Our second contribution is to develop a second and faster approach. The backbone of this second approach is a novel SDP relaxation combined with a fast and scalable solver based on smooth Riemannian optimization. We show that this approach, named Fast Unconstrained SEmidefinite Solver (FUSES), can solve large problems in milliseconds. Contrarily to local MRF solvers, e.g., loopy belief propagation, our approaches do not require an initial guess. Moreover, we leverage recent results from optimization theory to provide per-instance sub-optimality guarantees. We demonstrate the proposed approaches in multi-class image segmentation problems. Extensive experimental evidence shows that (i) FUSES and DARS produce near-optimal solutions, attaining an objective within 0.1% of the optimum, (ii) FUSES and DARS are remarkably faster than general-purpose SDP solvers, and FUSES is more than two orders of magnitude faster than DARS while attaining similar solution quality, (iii) FUSES is faster than local search methods while being a global solver.",0

"Fully convolutional deep neural networks have been asserted to be fast and precise frameworks with great potential in image segmentation. One of the major challenges in training such networks raises when data is unbalanced, which is common in many medical imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where lesion class voxels are often much lower in numbers than non-lesion voxels. A trained network with unbalanced data may make predictions with high precision and low recall, being severely biased towards the non-lesion class which is particularly undesired in most medical applications where FNs are more important than FPs. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem, more recently similarity loss functions and focal loss. In this work we trained fully convolutional deep neural networks using an asymmetric similarity loss function to mitigate the issue of data imbalance and achieve much better tradeoff between precision and recall. To this end, we developed a 3D FC-DenseNet with large overlapping image patches as input and an asymmetric similarity loss layer based on Tversky index (using Fbeta scores). We used large overlapping image patches as inputs for intrinsic and extrinsic data augmentation, a patch selection algorithm, and a patch prediction fusion strategy using B-spline weighted soft voting to account for the uncertainty of prediction in patch borders. We applied this method to MS lesion segmentation based on two different datasets of MSSEG and ISBI longitudinal MS lesion segmentation challenge, where we achieved top performance in both challenges. Our network trained with focal loss ranked first according to the ISBI challenge overall score and resulted in the lowest reported lesion false positive rate among all submitted methods. Our network trained with the asymmetric similarity loss led to the lowest surface distance and the best lesion true positive rate.",0

"The graph Laplacian is a standard tool in data science, machine learning, and image processing. The corresponding matrix inherits the complex structure of the underlying network and is in certain applications densely populated. This makes computations, in particular matrix-vector products, with the graph Laplacian a hard task. A typical application is the computation of a number of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Standard methods become infeasible as the number of nodes in the graph is too large. We propose the use of the fast summation based on the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT) to perform the dense matrix-vector product with the graph Laplacian fast without ever forming the whole matrix. The enormous flexibility of the NFFT algorithm allows us to embed the accelerated multiplication into Lanczos-based eigenvalues routines or iterative linear system solvers and even consider other than the standard Gaussian kernels. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach on a number of test problems from image segmentation to semi-supervised learning based on graph-based PDEs. In particular, we compare our approach with the Nystr\""om method. Moreover, we present and test an enhanced, hybrid version of the Nystr\""om method, which internally uses the NFFT.",0

"Weakly-supervised instance segmentation, which could greatly save labor and time cost of pixel mask annotation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The commonly used pipeline firstly utilizes conventional image segmentation methods to automatically generate initial masks and then use them to train an off-the-shelf segmentation network in an iterative way. However, the initial generated masks usually contains a notable proportion of invalid masks which are mainly caused by small object instances. Directly using these initial masks to train segmentation model is harmful for the performance. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid network in this paper. In our architecture, there is a principle segmentation network which is used to handle the normal samples with valid generated masks. In addition, a complementary branch is added to handle the small and dim objects without valid masks. Experimental results indicate that our method can achieve significantly performance improvement both on the small object instances and large ones, and outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are indispensable for modeling many physical phenomena and also commonly used for solving image processing tasks. In the latter area, PDE-based approaches interpret image data as discretizations of multivariate functions and the output of image processing algorithms as solutions to certain PDEs. Posing image processing problems in the infinite dimensional setting provides powerful tools for their analysis and solution. Over the last few decades, the reinterpretation of classical image processing problems through the PDE lens has been creating multiple celebrated approaches that benefit a vast area of tasks including image segmentation, denoising, registration, and reconstruction.   In this paper, we establish a new PDE-interpretation of a class of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are commonly used to learn from speech, image, and video data.

"The most recent fast and accurate image segmentation methods are built upon fully convolutional deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose new deep learning strategies for DenseNets to improve segmenting images with subtle differences in intensity values and features. We aim to segment brain tissue on infant brain MRI at about 6 months of age where white matter and gray matter of the developing brain show similar T1 and T2 relaxation times, thus appear to have similar intensity values on both T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans. Brain tissue segmentation at this age is, therefore, very challenging. To this end, we propose an exclusive multi-label training strategy to segment the mutually exclusive brain tissues with similarity loss functions that automatically balance the training based on class prevalence. Using our proposed training strategy based on similarity loss functions and patch prediction fusion we decrease the number of parameters in the network, reduce the complexity of the training process focusing the attention on less number of tasks, while mitigating the effects of data imbalance between labels and inaccuracies near patch borders. By taking advantage of these strategies we were able to perform fast image segmentation (90 seconds per 3D volume), using a network with less parameters than many state-of-the-art networks, overcoming issues such as 3Dvs2D training and large vs small patch size selection, while achieving the top performance in segmenting brain tissue among all methods tested in first and second round submissions of the isointense infant brain MRI segmentation (iSeg) challenge according to the official challenge test results.

"Radiological imaging offers effective measurement of anatomy, which is useful in disease diagnosis and assessment. Previous study has shown that the left atrial wall remodeling can provide information to predict treatment outcome in atrial fibrillation. Nevertheless, the segmentation of the left atrial structures from medical images is still very time-consuming. Current advances in neural network may help creating automatic segmentation models that reduce the workload for clinicians. In this preliminary study, we propose automated, two-stage, three-dimensional U-Nets with convolutional neural network, for the challenging task of left atrial segmentation. Unlike previous two-dimensional image segmentation methods, we use 3D U-Nets to obtain the heart cavity directly in 3D. The dual 3D U-Net structure consists of, a first U-Net to coarsely segment and locate the left atrium, and a second U-Net to accurately segment the left atrium under higher resolution. In addition, we introduce a Contour loss based on additional distance information to adjust the final segmentation. We randomly split the data into training datasets (80 subjects) and validation datasets (20 subjects) to train multiple models, with different augmentation setting. Experiments show that the average Dice coefficients for validation datasets are around 0.91 - 0.92, the sensitivity around 0.90-0.94 and the specificity 0.99. Compared with traditional Dice loss, models trained with Contour loss in general offer smaller Hausdorff distance with similar Dice coefficient, and have less connected components in predictions.

For example, image segmentation (separation into foreground and background layers); transparent layer separation (into reflection and transmission layers); Image dehazing (separation into a clear image and a haze map), and more. In this paper we propose a unified framework for unsupervised layer decomposition of a single image, based on coupled ""Deep-image-Prior"" (DIP) networks. It was shown [Ulyanov et al] that the structure of a single DIP generator network is sufficient to capture the low-level statistics of a single image. We show that coupling multiple such DIPs provides a powerful tool for decomposing images into their basic components, for a wide variety of applications. This capability stems from the fact that the internal statistics of a mixture of layers is more complex than the statistics of each of its individual components. We show the power of this approach for Image-Dehazing, Fg/Bg Segmentation, Watermark-Removal, Transparency Separation in images and video, and more. These capabilities are achieved in a totally unsupervised way, with no training examples other than the input image/video itself.",0
"A range of computer vision tasks can be considered as a type of image decomposition into distinct layers. This includes activities such as image segmentation, transparent layer separation and image dehazing. In this study, we propose a unified framework for unsupervised layer decomposition of a single image, utilizing connected ""Deep-image-Prior"" networks. Research has demonstrated that a single DIP generator network can capture the low-level statistics of a single image. By coupling multiple DIPs, we can effectively break down images into their fundamental components for various applications. This is particularly useful as the internal statistics of a mixture of layers are more complex than those of individual components. We showcase the potential of this approach for tasks such as Image-Dehazing, Fg/Bg Segmentation, Watermark-Removal and Transparency Separation in both images and videos. The technique is entirely unsupervised, requiring no training examples beyond the input image or video.",1
"While deep learning has achieved significant advances in accuracy for medical image segmentation, its benefits for deformable image registration have so far remained limited to reduced computation times. Previous work has either focused on replacing the iterative optimization of distance and smoothness terms with CNN-layers or using supervised approaches driven by labels. Our method is the first to combine the complementary strengths of global semantic information (represented by segmentation labels) and local distance metrics that help align surrounding structures. We demonstrate significant higher Dice scores (of 86.5\%) for deformable cardiac image registration compared to classic registration (79.0\%) as well as label-driven deep learning frameworks (83.4\%).",0

"Radiologist is ""doctor's doctor"", biomedical image segmentation plays a central role in quantitative analysis, clinical diagnosis, and medical intervention. In the light of the fully convolutional networks (FCN) and U-Net, deep convolutional networks (DNNs) have made significant contributions in biomedical image segmentation applications. In this paper, based on U-Net, we propose MDUnet, a multi-scale densely connected U-net for biomedical image segmentation. we propose three different multi-scale dense connections for U shaped architectures encoder, decoder and across them. The highlights of our architecture is directly fuses the neighboring different scale feature maps from both higher layers and lower layers to strengthen feature propagation in current layer. Which can largely improves the information flow encoder, decoder and across them. Multi-scale dense connections, which means containing shorter connections between layers close to the input and output, also makes much deeper U-net possible. We adopt the optimal model based on the experiment and propose a novel Multi-scale Dense U-Net (MDU-Net) architecture with quantization. Which reduce overfitting in MDU-Net for better accuracy.

"Accurate segmentation of different sub-regions of gliomas including peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core from multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous appearance and shape, segmentation of the sub-regions is very challenging. Recent development using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in the past several brain segmentation challenges as well as other semantic and medical image segmentation problems. Most models in brain tumor segmentation use a 2D/3D patch to predict the class label for the center voxel and variant patch sizes and scales are used to improve the model performance. However, it has low computation efficiency and also has limited receptive field. U-Net is a widely used network structure for end-to-end segmentation and can be used on the entire image or extracted patches to provide classification labels over the entire input voxels so that it is more efficient and expect to yield better performance with larger input size. Furthermore, instead of picking the best network structure, an ensemble of multiple models, trained on different dataset or different hyper-parameters, can generally improve the segmentation performance. In this study we propose to use an ensemble of 3D U-Nets with different hyper-parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Preliminary results showed effectiveness of this model. In addition, we developed a linear model for survival prediction using extracted imaging and non-imaging features, which, despite the simplicity, can effectively reduce overfitting and regression errors.",0

"Segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is a fundamental step in many medical imaging-based applications. The recent implementation of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image processing has been shown to have significant impacts on medical image segmentation. Network training of segmentation CNNs typically requires images and paired annotation data representing pixel-wise tissue labels referred to as masks. However, the supervised training of highly efficient CNNs with deeper structure and more network parameters requires a large number of training images and paired tissue masks. Thus, there is great need to develop a generalized CNN-based segmentation method which would be applicable for a wide variety of MR image datasets with different tissue contrasts. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a generalized CNN-based method for fully-automated segmentation of different MR image datasets using a single set of annotated training data. A technique called cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is applied as the core of the proposed method to perform image-to-image translation between MR image datasets with different tissue contrasts. A joint segmentation network is incorporated into the adversarial network to obtain additional segmentation functionality. The proposed method was evaluated for segmenting bone and cartilage on two clinical knee MR image datasets acquired at our institution using only a single set of annotated data from a publicly available knee MR image dataset. The new technique may further improve the applicability and efficiency of CNN-based segmentation of medical images while eliminating the need for large amounts of annotated training data.",0

"Increasing the mini-batch size for stochastic gradient descent offers significant opportunities to reduce wall-clock training time, but there are a variety of theoretical and systems challenges that impede the widespread success of this technique. We investigate these issues, with an emphasis on time to convergence and total computational cost, through an extensive empirical analysis of network training across several architectures and problem domains, including image classification, image segmentation, and language modeling. Although it is common practice to increase the batch size in order to fully exploit available computational resources, we find a substantially more nuanced picture. Our main finding is that across a wide range of network architectures and problem domains, increasing the batch size beyond a certain point yields no decrease in wall-clock time to convergence for \emph{either} train or test loss. This batch size is usually substantially below the capacity of current systems. We show that popular training strategies for large batch size optimization begin to fail before we can populate all available compute resources, and we show that the point at which these methods break down depends more on attributes like model architecture and data complexity than it does directly on the size of the dataset.",0

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become increasingly popular for solving a variety of computer vision tasks, ranging from image classification to image segmentation. Recently, autonomous vehicles have created a demand for depth information, which is often obtained using hardware sensors such as Light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Although it can provide precise distance measurements, most LIDARs are still far too expensive to sell in mass-produced consumer vehicles, which has motivated methods to generate depth information from commodity automotive sensors like cameras.   In this paper, we propose an approach called Deep Sensor Cloning (DSC). The idea is to use Convolutional Neural Networks in conjunction with inexpensive sensors to replicate the 3D point-clouds that are created by expensive LIDARs. To accomplish this, we develop a new dataset (DSDepth) and a new family of CNN architectures (DSCnets). While previous tasks such as KITTI depth prediction use an interpolated RGB-D images as ground-truth for training, we instead use DSCnets to directly predict LIDAR point-clouds. When we compare the output of our models to a $75,000 LIDAR, we find that our most accurate DSCnet achieves a relative error of 5.77% using a single camera and 4.69% using stereo cameras.",0

"This paper presents a novel framework in which video/image segmentation and localization are cast into a single optimization problem that integrates information from low level appearance cues with that of high level localization cues in a very weakly supervised manner. The proposed framework leverages two representations at different levels, exploits the spatial relationship between bounding boxes and superpixels as linear constraints and simultaneously discriminates between foreground and background at bounding box and superpixel level. Different from previous approaches that mainly rely on discriminative clustering, we incorporate a foreground model that minimizes the histogram difference of an object across all image frames. Exploiting the geometric relation between the superpixels and bounding boxes enables the transfer of segmentation cues to improve localization output and vice-versa. Inclusion of the foreground model generalizes our discriminative framework to video data where the background tends to be similar and thus, not discriminative. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework on the YouTube Object video dataset, Internet Object Discovery dataset and Pascal VOC 2007.",0

"We consider the structured-output prediction problem through probabilistic approaches and generalize the ""perturb-and-MAP"" framework to more challenging weighted Hamming losses, which are crucial in applications. While in principle our approach is a straightforward marginalization, it requires solving many related MAP inference problems. We show that for log-supermodular pairwise models these operations can be performed efficiently using the machinery of dynamic graph cuts. We also propose to use double stochastic gradient descent, both on the data and on the perturbations, for efficient learning. Our framework can naturally take weak supervision (e.g., partial labels) into account. We conduct a set of experiments on medium-scale character recognition and image segmentation, showing the benefits of our algorithms.",0

"In multi-organ segmentation of abdominal CT scans, most existing fully supervised deep learning algorithms require lots of voxel-wise annotations, which are usually difficult, expensive, and slow to obtain. In comparison, massive unlabeled 3D CT volumes are usually easily accessible. Current mainstream works to address the semi-supervised biomedical image segmentation problem are mostly graph-based. By contrast, deep network based semi-supervised learning methods have not drawn much attention in this field. In this work, we propose Deep Multi-Planar Co-Training (DMPCT), whose contributions can be divided into two folds: 1) The deep model is learned in a co-training style which can mine consensus information from multiple planes like the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes; 2) Multi-planar fusion is applied to generate more reliable pseudo-labels, which alleviates the errors occurring in the pseudo-labels and thus can help to train better segmentation networks. Experiments are done on our newly collected large dataset with 100 unlabeled cases as well as 210 labeled cases where 16 anatomical structures are manually annotated by four radiologists and confirmed by a senior expert. The results suggest that DMPCT significantly outperforms the fully supervised method by more than 4% especially when only a small set of annotations is used.",0

"The training of many existing end-to-end steering angle prediction models heavily relies on steering angles as the supervisory signal. Without learning from much richer contexts, these methods are susceptible to the presence of sharp road curves, challenging traffic conditions, strong shadows, and severe lighting changes. In this paper, we considerably improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions through heterogeneous auxiliary networks feature mimicking, a new and effective training method that provides us with much richer contextual signals apart from steering direction. Specifically, we train our steering angle predictive model by distilling multi-layer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous auxiliary networks that perform related but different tasks, e.g., image segmentation or optical flow estimation. As opposed to multi-task learning, our method does not require expensive annotations of related tasks on the target set. This is made possible by applying contemporary off-the-shelf networks on the target set and mimicking their features in different layers after transformation. The auxiliary networks are discarded after training without affecting the runtime efficiency of our model.

The proposed architecture separates the learning model into a perception module and a control policy module, and uses semantic image segmentation as the meta representation for relating these two modules. The perception module translates the perceived RGB image to semantic image segmentation. The control policy module is implemented as a deep reinforcement learning agent, which performs actions based on the translated image segmentation. Our architecture is evaluated in an obstacle avoidance task and a target following task. Experimental results show that our architecture significantly outperforms all of the baseline methods in both virtual and real environments, and demonstrates a faster learning curve than them. We also present a detailed analysis for a variety of variant configurations, and validate the transferability of our modular architecture.",0
"Gathering training data in the real world can be a risky and time-consuming process for delicate robots, which is why recent developments in robot learning suggest using simulators as a training platform. However, the gap between synthetic and real visual data makes it difficult to apply the models learned in virtual worlds to the real world. This paper proposes a modular architecture that addresses this virtual-to-real problem. The architecture separates the learning model into two modules: a perception module and a control policy module, and utilizes semantic image segmentation as a meta representation to link the two. The perception module converts the perceived RGB image into semantic image segmentation, while the control policy module is implemented as a deep reinforcement learning agent that takes actions based on the translated image segmentation. The performance of our architecture is evaluated in an obstacle avoidance task and a target following task, and the results show that it outperforms all baseline methods in both virtual and real environments, and has a faster learning curve. We also present a detailed analysis of various configurations and confirm the transferability of our modular architecture.",1
"State of the art methods for semantic image segmentation are trained in a supervised fashion using a large corpus of fully labeled training images. However, gathering such a corpus is expensive, due to human annotation effort, in contrast to gathering unlabeled data. We propose an active learning-based strategy, called CEREALS, in which a human only has to hand-label a few, automatically selected, regions within an unlabeled image corpus. This minimizes human annotation effort while maximizing the performance of a semantic image segmentation method. The automatic selection procedure is achieved by: a) using a suitable information measure combined with an estimate about human annotation effort, which is inferred from a learned cost model, and b) exploiting the spatial coherency of an image. The performance of CEREALS is demonstrated on Cityscapes, where we are able to reduce the annotation effort to 17%, while keeping 95% of the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of a model that was trained with the fully annotated training set of Cityscapes.",0

"Objective: Deformable image registration is a fundamental problem in medical image analysis, with applications such as longitudinal studies, population modeling, and atlas based image segmentation. Registration is often phrased as an optimization problem, i.e., finding a deformation field that is optimal according to a given objective function. Discrete, combinatorial, optimization techniques have successfully been employed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Specifically, optimization based on $\alpha$-expansion with minimal graph cuts has been proposed as a powerful tool for image registration. The high computational cost of the graph-cut based optimization approach, however, limits the utility of this approach for registration of large volume images. Methods: Here, we propose to accelerate graph-cut based deformable registration by dividing the image into overlapping sub-regions and restricting the $\alpha$-expansion moves to a single sub-region at a time. Results: We demonstrate empirically that this approach can achieve a large reduction in computation time -- from days to minutes -- with only a small penalty in terms of solution quality. Conclusion: The reduction in computation time provided by the proposed method makes graph cut based deformable registration viable for large volume images. Significance: Graph cut based image registration has previously been shown to produce excellent results, but the high computational cost has hindered the adoption of the method for registration of large medical volume images. Our proposed method lifts this restriction, requiring only a small fraction of the computational cost to produce results of comparable quality.",0
"The aim of this study is to address the issue of deformable image registration in medical image analysis, which has various applications such as atlas-based image segmentation, population modeling, and longitudinal studies. This problem involves finding an optimal deformation field by optimizing an objective function. While combinatorial optimization techniques like $\alpha$-expansion with minimal graph cuts have been successful in solving this problem, the high computational cost of this method limits its effectiveness for larger images. To accelerate this process, we propose dividing the image into overlapping sub-regions and limiting $\alpha$-expansion moves to one sub-region at a time. Empirical evidence suggests that this approach significantly reduces computation time without sacrificing solution quality. Therefore, the proposed method enables graph cut based deformable registration for larger volume images, which was previously unfeasible due to computational constraints.",1
"Weakly-supervised image segmentation is an important task in computer vision. A key problem is how to obtain high quality objects location from image-level category. Classification activation mapping is a common method which can be used to generate high-precise object location cues. However these location cues are generally very sparse and small such that they can not provide effective information for image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a saliency guided image segmentation network to resolve this problem. We employ a self-attention saliency method to generate subtle saliency maps, and render the location cues grow as seeds by seeded region growing method to expand pixel-level labels extent. In the process of seeds growing, we use the saliency values to weight the similarity between pixels to control the growing. Therefore saliency information could help generate discriminative object regions, and the effects of wrong salient pixels can be suppressed efficiently. Experimental results on a common segmentation dataset PASCAL VOC2012 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",0

"In this paper, we focus on three problems in deep learning based medical image segmentation. Firstly, U-net, as a popular model for medical image segmentation, is difficult to train when convolutional layers increase even though a deeper network usually has a better generalization ability because of more learnable parameters. Secondly, the exponential ReLU (ELU), as an alternative of ReLU, is not much different from ReLU when the network of interest gets deep. Thirdly, the Dice loss, as one of the pervasive loss functions for medical image segmentation, is not effective when the prediction is close to ground truth and will cause oscillation during training. To address the aforementioned three problems, we propose and validate a deeper network that can fit medical image datasets that are usually small in the sample size. Meanwhile, we propose a new loss function to accelerate the learning process and a combination of different activation functions to improve the network performance. Our experimental results suggest that our network is comparable or superior to state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for body tissue composition analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation. However, quantification of body composition requires an accurate segmentation of fat, muscle and other tissues from MR images, which remains a challenging goal due to the intensity overlap between them. In this study, we propose a fully automated, data-driven image segmentation platform that addresses multiple difficulties in segmenting MR images such as varying inhomogeneity, non-standardness, and noise, while producing high-quality definition of different tissues. In contrast to most approaches in the literature, we perform segmentation operation by combining three different MRI contrasts and a novel segmentation tool which takes into account variability in the data. The proposed system, based on a novel affinity definition within the fuzzy connectivity (FC) image segmentation family, prevents the need for user intervention and reparametrization of the segmentation algorithms. In order to make the whole system fully automated, we adapt an affinity propagation clustering algorithm to roughly identify tissue regions and image background. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed algorithm's individual steps as well as comparison with several approaches from the literature for the main application of muscle/fat separation. Furthermore, whole-body tissue composition and brain tissue delineation were conducted to show the generalization ability of the proposed system. This new automated platform outperforms other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches both in accuracy and efficiency.",0

"Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into meaningful segments. The meaning of the segments is subjective due to the definition of homogeneity is varied based on the users perspective hence the automation of the segmentation is challenging. Watershed is a popular segmentation technique which assumes topographic map in an image, with the brightness of each pixel representing its height, and finds the lines that run along the tops of ridges. The results from the algorithm typically suffer from over segmentation due to the lack of knowledge of the objects being classified. This paper presents an approach to reduce the over segmentation of watershed algorithm by assuming that the different adjacent segments of an object have similar color distribution. The approach demonstrates an improvement over conventional watershed algorithm.",0

"We consider an important task of effective and efficient semantic image segmentation. In particular, we adapt a powerful semantic segmentation architecture, called RefineNet, into the more compact one, suitable even for tasks requiring real-time performance on high-resolution inputs. To this end, we identify computationally expensive blocks in the original setup, and propose two modifications aimed to decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations. By doing that, we achieve more than twofold model reduction, while keeping the performance levels almost intact. Our fastest model undergoes a significant speed-up boost from 20 FPS to 55 FPS on a generic GPU card on 512x512 inputs with solid 81.1% mean iou performance on the test set of PASCAL VOC, while our slowest model with 32 FPS (from original 17 FPS) shows 82.7% mean iou on the same dataset.

"In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for anatomy segmentation and automatic landmark- ing. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of mandible segmentation from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and identification of 9 anatomical landmarks of the mandible on the geodesic space. The overall approach employs three inter-related steps. In step 1, we propose a deep neu- ral network architecture with carefully designed regularization, and network hyper-parameters to perform image segmentation without the need for data augmentation and complex post- processing refinement. In step 2, we formulate the landmark localization problem directly on the geodesic space for sparsely- spaced anatomical landmarks. In step 3, we propose to use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to identify closely- spaced landmarks, which is rather difficult to obtain using other standard detection networks. The proposed fully automated method showed superior efficacy compared to the state-of-the- art mandible segmentation and landmarking approaches in craniofacial anomalies and diseased states. We used a very challenging CBCT dataset of 50 patients with a high-degree of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) variability that is realistic in clinical practice. Complementary to the quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection was conducted for distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability.

"This work addresses the problem of semantic image segmentation of nighttime scenes. Although considerable progress has been made in semantic image segmentation, it is mainly related to daytime scenarios. This paper proposes a novel method to progressive adapt the semantic models trained on daytime scenes, along with large-scale annotations therein, to nighttime scenes via the bridge of twilight time -- the time between dawn and sunrise, or between sunset and dusk. The goal of the method is to alleviate the cost of human annotation for nighttime images by transferring knowledge from standard daytime conditions. In addition to the method, a new dataset of road scenes is compiled; it consists of 35,000 images ranging from daytime to twilight time and to nighttime. Also, a subset of the nighttime images are densely annotated for method evaluation. Our experiments show that our method is effective for model adaptation from daytime scenes to nighttime scenes, without using extra human annotation.",0

"In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional two-stream fusion network (FCTSFN) for interactive image segmentation. The proposed network includes two sub-networks: a two-stream late fusion network (TSLFN) that predicts the foreground at a reduced resolution, and a multi-scale refining network (MSRN) that refines the foreground at full resolution. The TSLFN includes two distinct deep streams followed by a fusion network. The intuition is that, since user interactions are more direct information on foreground/background than the image itself, the two-stream structure of the TSLFN reduces the number of layers between the pure user interaction features and the network output, allowing the user interactions to have a more direct impact on the segmentation result. The MSRN fuses the features from different layers of TSLFN with different scales, in order to seek the local to global information on the foreground to refine the segmentation result at full resolution. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed network achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation methods",0

"We propose a novel framework for structured prediction via adversarial learning. Existing adversarial learning methods involve two separate networks, i.e., the structured prediction models and the discriminative models, in the training. The information captured by discriminative models complements that in the structured prediction models, but few existing researches have studied on utilizing such information to improve structured prediction models at the inference stage. In this work, we propose to refine the predictions of structured prediction models by effectively integrating discriminative models into the prediction. Discriminative models are treated as energy-based models. Similar to the adversarial learning, discriminative models are trained to estimate scores which measure the quality of predicted outputs, while structured prediction models are trained to predict contrastive outputs with maximal energy scores. In this way, the gradient vanishing problem is ameliorated, and thus we are able to perform inference by following the ascent gradient directions of discriminative models to refine structured prediction models.

"Histopathological prognostication of neoplasia including most tumor grading systems are based upon a number of criteria. Probably the most important is the number of mitotic figures which are most commonly determined as the mitotic count (MC), i.e. number of mitotic figures within 10 consecutive high power fields. Often the area with the highest mitotic activity is to be selected for the MC. However, since mitotic activity is not known in advance, an arbitrary choice of this region is considered one important cause for high variability in the prognostication and grading.   In this work, we present an algorithmic approach that first calculates a mitotic cell map based upon a deep convolutional network. This map is in a second step used to construct a mitotic activity estimate. Lastly, we select the image segment representing the size of ten high power fields with the overall highest mitotic activity as a region proposal for an expert MC determination. We evaluate the approach using a dataset of 32 completely annotated whole slide images, where 22 were used for training of the network and 10 for test. We find a correlation of r=0.936 in mitotic count estimate.",0

"Left atrium shape has been shown to be an independent predictor of recurrence after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Shape-based representation is imperative to such an estimation process, where correspondence-based representation offers the most flexibility and ease-of-computation for population-level shape statistics.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach that uses deep networks to estimate AF recurrence by predicting shape descriptors directly from MRI images, with NO image pre-processing involved. We also propose a novel data augmentation scheme to effectively train a deep network in a limited training data setting. We compare this new method of estimating shape descriptors from images with the state-of-the-art correspondence-based shape modeling that requires image segmentation and correspondence optimization.

"The U-Net was presented in 2015. With its straight-forward and successful architecture it quickly evolved to a commonly used benchmark in medical image segmentation. The adaptation of the U-Net to novel problems, however, comprises several degrees of freedom regarding the exact architecture, preprocessing, training and inference. These choices are not independent of each other and substantially impact the overall performance. The present paper introduces the nnU-Net ('no-new-Net'), which refers to a robust and self-adapting framework on the basis of 2D and 3D vanilla U-Nets. We argue the strong case for taking away superfluous bells and whistles of many proposed network designs and instead focus on the remaining aspects that make out the performance and generalizability of a method. We evaluate the nnU-Net in the context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge, which measures segmentation performance in ten disciplines comprising distinct entities, image modalities, image geometries and dataset sizes, with no manual adjustments between datasets allowed. At the time of manuscript submission, nnU-Net achieves the highest mean dice scores across all classes and seven phase 1 tasks (except class 1 in BrainTumour) in the online leaderboard of the challenge.",0

"This paper proposes a deep learning architecture that attains statistically significant improvements over traditional algorithms in Poisson image denoising espically when the noise is strong. Poisson noise commonly occurs in low-light and photon- limited settings, where the noise can be most accurately modeled by the Poission distribution. Poisson noise traditionally prevails only in specific fields such as astronomical imaging. However, with the booming market of surveillance cameras, which commonly operate in low-light environments, or mobile phones, which produce noisy night scene pictures due to lower-grade sensors, the necessity for an advanced Poisson image denoising algorithm has increased. Deep learning has achieved amazing breakthroughs in other imaging problems, such image segmentation and recognition, and this paper proposes a deep learning denoising network that outperforms traditional algorithms in Poisson denoising especially when the noise is strong. The architecture incorporates a hybrid of convolutional and deconvolutional layers along with symmetric connections. The denoising network achieved statistically significant 0.38dB, 0.68dB, and 1.04dB average PSNR gains over benchmark traditional algorithms in experiments with image peak values 4, 2, and 1. The denoising network can also operate with shorter computational time while still outperforming the benchmark algorithm by tuning the reconstruction stride sizes.",0

"Over the past years, computer vision community has contributed to enormous progress in semantic image segmentation, a per-pixel classification task, crucial for dense scene understanding and rapidly becoming vital in lots of real-world applications, including driverless cars and medical imaging. Most recent models are now reaching previously unthinkable numbers (e.g., 89% mean iou on PASCAL VOC, 83% on CityScapes), and, while intersection-over-union and a range of other metrics provide the general picture of model performance, in this paper we aim to extend them into other meaningful and important for applications characteristics, answering such questions as 'how accurate the model segmentation is on small objects in the general scene?', or 'what are the sources of uncertainty that cause the model to make an erroneous prediction?'.

"Encoding images as a series of high-level constructs, such as brush strokes or discrete shapes, can often be key to both human and machine understanding. In many cases, however, data is only available in pixel form. We present a method for generating images directly in a high-level domain (e.g. brush strokes), without the need for real pairwise data. Specifically, we train a ""canvas"" network to imitate the mapping of high-level constructs to pixels, followed by a high-level ""drawing"" network which is optimized through this mapping towards solving a desired image recreation or translation task.

"With the introduction of fully convolutional neural networks, deep learning has raised the benchmark for medical image segmentation on both speed and accuracy, and different networks have been proposed for 2D and 3D segmentation with promising results. Nevertheless, most networks only handle relatively small numbers of labels (<10), and there are very limited works on handling highly unbalanced object sizes especially in 3D segmentation. In this paper, we propose a network architecture and the corresponding loss function which improve segmentation of very small structures. By combining skip connections and deep supervision with respect to the computational feasibility of 3D segmentation, we propose a fast converging and computationally efficient network architecture for accurate segmentation. Furthermore, inspired by the concept of focal loss, we propose an exponential logarithmic loss which balances the labels not only by their relative sizes but also by their segmentation difficulties. We achieve an average Dice coefficient of 82% on brain segmentation with 20 labels, with the ratio of the smallest to largest object sizes as 0.14%. Less than 100 epochs are required to reach such accuracy, and segmenting a 128x128x128 volume only takes around 0.4 s.",0

"Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is the state-of-the-art method for image segmentation, which is one of key challenging computer vision tasks. However, DCNN requires a lot of training images with corresponding image masks to get a good segmentation result. Image annotation software which is easy to use and allows fast image mask generation is in great demand. To the best of our knowledge, all existing image annotation software support only drawing bounding polygons, bounding boxes, or bounding ellipses to mark target objects. These existing software are inefficient when targeting objects that have irregular shapes (e.g., defects in fabric images or tire images). In this paper we design an easy-to-use image annotation software called Mask Editor for image mask generation. Mask Editor allows drawing any bounding curve to mark objects and improves efficiency to mark objects with irregular shapes. Mask Editor also supports drawing bounding polygons, drawing bounding boxes, drawing bounding ellipses, painting, erasing, super-pixel-marking, image cropping, multi-class masks, mask loading, and mask modifying.",0

"Tumor detection in biomedical imaging is a time-consuming process for medical professionals and is not without errors. Thus in recent decades, researchers have developed algorithmic techniques for image processing using a wide variety of mathematical methods, such as statistical modeling, variational techniques, and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic method for liver segmentation of 2D CT scans into three labels denoting healthy, vessel, or tumor tissue based on graph cuts. First, we create a feature vector for each pixel in a novel way that consists of the 59 intensity values in the time series data and propose a simplified perimeter cost term in the energy functional. We normalize the data and perimeter terms in the functional to expedite the graph cut without having to optimize the scaling parameter $\lambda$. In place of a training process, predetermined tissue means are computed based on sample regions identified by expert radiologists. The proposed method also has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement computationally. It was evaluated against the ground truth on a clinical CT dataset of 10 tumors and yielded segmentations with a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of .77 and mean volume overlap error (VOE) of 36.7%. The average processing time was 1.25 minutes per slice.",0

"The design of neural network architectures is an important component for achieving state-of-the-art performance with machine learning systems across a broad array of tasks. Much work has endeavored to design and build architectures automatically through clever construction of a search space paired with simple learning algorithms. Recent progress has demonstrated that such meta-learning methods may exceed scalable human-invented architectures on image classification tasks. An open question is the degree to which such methods may generalize to new domains. In this work we explore the construction of meta-learning techniques for dense image prediction focused on the tasks of scene parsing, person-part segmentation, and semantic image segmentation. Constructing viable search spaces in this domain is challenging because of the multi-scale representation of visual information and the necessity to operate on high resolution imagery. Based on a survey of techniques in dense image prediction, we construct a recursive search space and demonstrate that even with efficient random search, we can identify architectures that outperform human-invented architectures and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three dense prediction tasks including 82.7\% on Cityscapes (street scene parsing), 71.3\% on PASCAL-Person-Part (person-part segmentation), and 87.9\% on PASCAL VOC 2012 (semantic image segmentation).

"Robot perception systems need to perform reliable image segmentation in real-time on noisy, raw perception data. State-of-the-art segmentation approaches use large CNN models and carefully constructed datasets; however, these models focus on accuracy at the cost of real-time inference. Furthermore, the standard semantic segmentation datasets are not large enough for training CNNs without augmentation and are not representative of noisy, uncurated robot perception data. We propose improving the performance of real-time segmentation frameworks on robot perception data by transferring features learned from synthetic segmentation data. We show that pretraining real-time segmentation architectures with synthetic segmentation data instead of ImageNet improves fine-tuning performance by reducing the bias learned in pretraining and closing the \textit{transfer gap} as a result. Our experiments show that our real-time robot perception models pretrained on synthetic data outperform those pretrained on ImageNet for every scale of fine-tuning data examined. Moreover, the degree to which synthetic pretraining outperforms ImageNet pretraining increases as the availability of robot data decreases, making our approach attractive for robotics domains where dataset collection is hard and/or expensive.",0

"Binary image segmentation plays an important role in computer vision and has been widely used in many applications such as image and video editing, object extraction, and photo composition. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive binary image segmentation method based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) framework and the fast bilateral solver (FBS) technique. Specifically, we employ the geodesic distance component to build the unary term. To ensure both computation efficiency and effective responsiveness for interactive segmentation, superpixels are used in computing geodesic distances instead of pixels. Furthermore, we take a bilateral affinity approach for the pairwise term in order to preserve edge information and denoise. Through the alternating direction strategy, the MRF energy minimization problem is divided into two subproblems, which then can be easily solved by steepest gradient descent (SGD) and FBS respectively. Experimental results on the VGG interactive image segmentation dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art ones, and in particular, it can achieve satisfactory edge-smooth segmentation results even when the foreground and background color appearances are quite indistinctive.",0

"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) characterized by progressive growth of renal cysts is the most prevalent and potentially lethal monogenic renal disease, affecting one in every 500-100 people.

"This chapter provides insight on how iris recognition, one of the leading biometric identification technologies in the world, can be impacted by pathologies and illnesses present in the eye, what are the possible repercussions of this influence, and what are the possible means for taking such effects into account when matching iris samples.   To make this study possible, a special database of iris images has been used, representing more than 20 different medical conditions of the ocular region (including cataract, glaucoma, rubeosis iridis, synechiae, iris defects, corneal pathologies and other) and containing almost 3000 samples collected from 230 distinct irises. Then, with the use of four different iris recognition methods, a series of experiments has been conducted, concluding in several important observations.   One of the most popular ocular disorders worldwide - the cataract - is shown to worsen genuine comparison scores when results obtained from cataract-affected eyes are compared to those coming from healthy irises. An analysis devoted to different types of impact on eye structures caused by diseases is also carried out with significant results. The enrollment process is highly sensitive to those eye conditions that make the iris obstructed or introduce geometrical distortions. Disorders affecting iris geometry, or producing obstructions are exceptionally capable of degrading the genuine comparison scores, so that the performance of the entire biometric system can be influenced. Experiments also reveal that imperfect execution of the image segmentation stage is the most prominent contributor to recognition errors.",0

Therefore, it scales well for very large data sets. Our approach is able to characterize the posterior probability density in the space of shapes through its samples, and to return multiple solutions, potentially from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which would be encountered, e.g., in segmenting objects from multiple shape classes.

"This paper delivers a new database of iris images collected in visible light using a mobile phone's camera and presents results of experiments involving existing commercial and open-source iris recognition methods, namely: IriCore, VeriEye, MIRLIN and OSIRIS. Several important observations are made.   First, we manage to show that after simple preprocessing, such images offer good visibility of iris texture even in heavily-pigmented irides. Second, for all four methods, the enrollment stage is not much affected by the fact that different type of data is used as input. This translates to zero or close-to-zero Failure To Enroll, i.e., cases when templates could not be extracted from the samples. Third, we achieved good matching accuracy, with correct genuine match rate exceeding 94.5% for all four methods, while simultaneously being able to maintain zero false match rate in every case. Correct genuine match rate of over 99.5% was achieved using one of the commercial methods, showing that such images can be used with the existing biometric solutions with minimum additional effort required. Finally, the experiments revealed that incorrect image segmentation is the most prevalent cause of recognition accuracy decrease.

Good matching accuracy is achieved, with a correct genuine match rate exceeding 94.5% for all four methods, and a zero false match rate in every case. The database is publicly available to researchers, and it is the first of its kind to exceed the image quality of near-infrared illuminated iris images according to ISO/IEC 19794-6 and 29794-6 documents. Finally, the experiments show that incorrect image segmentation is the most prevalent cause of recognition accuracy decrease. The study demonstrates the potential of using mobile devices for iris recognition with minimum additional effort required for existing biometric solutions.",1
"This paper presents the experimental study revealing weaker performance of the automatic iris recognition methods for cataract-affected eyes when compared to healthy eyes. There is little research on the topic, mostly incorporating scarce databases that are often deficient in images representing more than one illness. We built our own database, acquiring 1288 eye images of 37 patients of the Medical University of Warsaw. Those images represent several common ocular diseases, such as cataract, along with less ordinary conditions, such as iris pattern alterations derived from illness or eye trauma. Images were captured in near-infrared light (used in biometrics) and for selected cases also in visible light (used in ophthalmological diagnosis). Since cataract is a disorder that is most populated by samples in the database, in this paper we focus solely on this illness. To assess the extent of the performance deterioration we use three iris recognition methodologies (commercial and academic solutions) to calculate genuine match scores for healthy eyes and those influenced by cataract. Results show a significant degradation in iris recognition reliability manifesting by worsening the genuine scores in all three matchers used in this study (12% of genuine score increase for an academic matcher, up to 175% of genuine score increase obtained for an example commercial matcher). This increase in genuine scores affected the final false non-match rate in two matchers. To our best knowledge this is the only study of such kind that employs more than one iris matcher, and analyzes the iris image segmentation as a potential source of decreased reliability.",0
"In this research, we conducted an experiment to investigate the performance of automatic iris recognition methods on cataract-affected eyes in comparison to healthy eyes. The topic has been sparsely researched, with most studies using databases with limited images representing only a single illness. To address this, we created our own database of 1288 eye images from 37 patients with various ocular diseases, including cataract and iris pattern alterations resulting from illness or trauma. The images were captured in both near-infrared and visible light. Since cataract was the most prevalent disorder in our database, we focused solely on this illness in our study. To evaluate the extent of performance deterioration, we used three iris recognition methodologies, including both commercial and academic solutions, to calculate genuine match scores for healthy and cataract-affected eyes. Our results indicated a significant degradation in iris recognition reliability for cataract-affected eyes, as evidenced by a decrease in genuine scores across all three matchers used in the study. This decrease in genuine scores also affected the final false non-match rate in two matchers. To our knowledge, this is the only study that employs multiple iris matchers and analyzes the iris image segmentation as a potential source of decreased reliability.",1

"The tracing of neural pathways through large volumes of image data is an incredibly tedious and time-consuming process that significantly encumbers progress in neuroscience. We are exploring deep learning's potential to automate segmentation of high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) image data to remove that barrier. We have started with neural pathway tracing through 5.1GB of whole-brain serial-section slices from larval zebrafish collected by the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University. This kind of manual image segmentation requires years of careful work to properly trace the neural pathways in an organism as small as a zebrafish larva (approximately 5mm in total body length). In automating this process, we would vastly improve productivity, leading to faster data analysis and breakthroughs in understanding the complexity of the brain. We will build upon prior attempts to employ deep learning for automatic image segmentation extending methods for unconventional deep learning data.",0

"For the task of subdecimeter aerial imagery segmentation, fine-grained semantic segmentation results are usually difficult to obtain because of complex remote sensing content and optical conditions. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance on this task. Although many deep neural network structures and techniques have been applied to improve the accuracy, few have paid attention to better differentiating the easily confused classes. In this paper, we propose TreeSegNet which adopts an adaptive network to increase the classification rate at the pixelwise level. Specifically, based on the infrastructure of DeepUNet, a Tree-CNN block in which each node represents a ResNeXt unit is constructed adaptively according to the confusion matrix and the proposed TreeCutting algorithm. By transporting feature maps through concatenating connections, the Tree-CNN block fuses multiscale features and learns best weights for the model. In experiments on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling Potsdam dataset, the results obtained by TreeSegNet are better than those of other published state-of-the-art methods. Detailed comparison and analysis show that the improvement brought by the adaptive Tree-CNN block is significant.",0

"Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89.0\% and 82.1\% without any post-processing.

"Confocal Laser Endomicroscope (CLE) is a novel handheld fluorescence imaging device that has shown promise for rapid intraoperative diagnosis of brain tumor tissue. Currently CLE is capable of image display only and lacks an automatic system to aid the surgeon in analyzing the images. The goal of this project was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic approach for CLE imaging of human glioma with feature localization function. Despite the tremendous progress in object detection and image segmentation methods in recent years, most of such methods require large annotated datasets for training. However, manual annotation of thousands of histopathological images by physicians is costly and time consuming. To overcome this problem, we propose a Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL)-based model for feature localization that trains on image-level annotations, and then localizes incidences of a class-of-interest in the test image. We developed a novel convolutional neural network for diagnostic features localization from CLE images by employing a novel multiscale activation map that is laterally inhibited and collaterally integrated. To validate our method, we compared proposed model's output to the manual annotation performed by four neurosurgeons on test images. Proposed model achieved 88% mean accuracy and 86% mean intersection over union on intermediate features and 87% mean accuracy and 88% mean intersection over union on restrictive fine features, while outperforming other state of the art methods tested.

"Existing works on semantic segmentation typically consider a small number of labels, ranging from tens to a few hundreds. With a large number of labels, training and evaluation of such task become extremely challenging due to correlation between labels and lack of datasets with complete annotations. We formulate semantic segmentation as a problem of image segmentation given a semantic concept, and propose a novel system which can potentially handle an unlimited number of concepts, including objects, parts, stuff, and attributes. We achieve this using a weakly and semi-supervised framework leveraging multiple datasets with different levels of supervision. We first train a deep neural network on a 6M stock image dataset with only image-level labels to learn visual-semantic embedding on 18K concepts. Then, we refine and extend the embedding network to predict an attention map, using a curated dataset with bounding box annotations on 750 concepts. Finally, we train an attention-driven class agnostic segmentation network using an 80-category fully annotated dataset. We perform extensive experiments to validate that the proposed system performs competitively to the state of the art on fully supervised concepts, and is capable of producing accurate segmentations for weakly learned and unseen concepts.",0

"Unsupervised learning poses one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision today. The task has an immense practical value with many applications in artificial intelligence and emerging technologies, as large quantities of unlabeled videos can be collected at relatively low cost.

We train a student deep network to predict the output of a teacher pathway that performs unsupervised object discovery in videos or large image collections. Our approach is different from published methods on unsupervised object discovery. We move the unsupervised learning phase during training time, then at test time we apply the standard feed-forward processing along the student pathway. This strategy has the benefit of allowing increased generalization possibilities during training, while remaining fast at testing. Our unsupervised learning algorithm can run over several generations of student-teacher training. Thus, a group of student networks trained in the first generation collectively create the teacher at the next generation.

"Segmentation of the left atrial chamber and assessing its morphology, are essential for improving our understanding of atrial fibrillation, the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. Automation of this process in 3D gadolinium enhanced-MRI (GE-MRI) data is desirable, as manual delineation is time-consuming, challenging and observer-dependent. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained tremendous traction and achieved state-of-the-art results in medical image segmentation.

"Multi-atlas segmentation approach is one of the most widely-used image segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. There are two major challenges in this category of methods, i.e., atlas selection and label fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-atlas segmentation method that formulates multi-atlas segmentation in a deep learning framework for better solving these challenges.

"Confusing classes that are ubiquitous in real world often degrade performance for many vision related applications like object detection, classification, and segmentation. The confusion errors are not only caused by similar visual patterns but also amplified by various factors during the training of our designed models, such as reduced feature resolution in the encoding process or imbalanced data distributions. A large amount of deep learning based network structures has been proposed in recent years to deal with these individual factors and improve network performance. However, to our knowledge, no existing work in semantic image segmentation is designed to tackle confusion errors explicitly. In this paper, we present a novel and general network structure that reduces confusion errors in more direct manner and apply the network for semantic segmentation. There are two major contributions in our network structure: 1) We ensemble subnets with heterogeneous output spaces based on the discriminative confusing groups. The training for each subnet can distinguish confusing classes within the group without affecting unrelated classes outside the group. 2) We propose an improved cross-entropy loss function that maximizes the probability assigned to the correct class and penalizes the probabilities assigned to the confusing classes at the same time. Our network structure is a general structure and can be easily adapted to any other networks to further reduce confusion errors. Without any changes in the feature encoder and post-processing steps, our experiments demonstrate consistent and significant improvements on different baseline models on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g., 3.05% over ResNet-101 and 1.30% over ResNet-38).",0

"Semantic Segmentation using deep convolutional neural network pose more complex challenge for any GPU intensive task. As it has to compute million of parameters, it results to huge memory consumption. Moreover, extracting finer features and conducting supervised training tends to increase the complexity. With the introduction of Fully Convolutional Neural Network, which uses finer strides and utilizes deconvolutional layers for upsampling, it has been a go to for any image segmentation task. In this paper, we propose two segmentation architecture which not only needs one-third the parameters to compute but also gives better accuracy than the similar architectures. The model weights were transferred from the popular neural net like VGG19 and VGG16 which were trained on Imagenet classification data-set. Then we transform all the fully connected layers to convolutional layers and use dilated convolution for decreasing the parameters.

"Deep convolutional neural networks pose a complex challenge for GPU-intensive tasks in semantic segmentation. This is due to the need to compute millions of parameters, resulting in extensive memory consumption. Furthermore, the complexity increases as finer features are extracted and supervised training is conducted. However, the Fully Convolutional Neural Network addresses these issues by utilizing deconvolutional layers for upsampling and finer strides. In this paper, we propose two segmentation architectures that require one-third of the parameters to compute and offer better accuracy than similar architectures. We achieve this by transferring model weights from popular neural nets like VGG19 and VGG16, transforming fully connected layers into convolutional layers, and using dilated convolution to decrease parameters. Additionally, we add finer strides and attach four skip architectures, which are element-wise summed with the deconvolutional layers in steps. We train and test on sparse and fine datasets like Pascal VOC2012, Pascal-Context, and NYUDv2, demonstrating the superior performance of our model.

"Thalamic alterations are relevant to many neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Routine interventions to improve symptom severity in movement disorders, for example, often consist of surgery or deep brain stimulation to diencephalic nuclei. Therefore, accurate delineation of grey matter thalamic subregions is of the upmost clinical importance. MRI is highly appropriate for structural segmentation as it provides different views of the anatomy from a single scanning session. Though with several contrasts potentially available, it is also of increasing importance to develop new image segmentation techniques that can operate multi-spectrally. We hereby propose a new segmentation method for use with multi-modality data, which we evaluated for automated segmentation of major thalamic subnuclear groups using T1-, T2*-weighted and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) information. The proposed method consists of four steps: highly iterative image co-registration, manual segmentation on the average training-data template, supervised learning for pattern recognition, and a final convex optimisation step imposing further spatial constraints to refine the solution. This led to solutions in greater agreement with manual segmentation than the standard Morel atlas based approach. Furthermore, we show that the multi-contrast approach boosts segmentation performances. We then investigated whether prior knowledge using the training-template contours could further improve convex segmentation accuracy and robustness, which led to highly precise multi-contrast segmentations in single subjects. This approach can be extended to most 3D imaging data types and any region of interest discernible in single scans or multi-subject templates.",0

"Mesh labeling is the key problem of classifying the facets of a 3D mesh with a label among a set of possible ones. State-of-the-art methods model mesh labeling as a Markov Random Field over the facets. These algorithms map image segmentations to the mesh by minimizing an energy function that comprises a data term, a smoothness terms, and class-specific priors. The latter favor a labeling with respect to another depending on the orientation of the facet normals. In this paper we propose a novel energy term that acts as a prior, but does not require any prior knowledge about the scene nor scene-specific relationship among classes. It bootstraps from a coarse mapping of the 2D segmentations on the mesh, and it favors the facets to be labeled according to the statistics of the mesh normals in their neighborhood. We tested our approach against five different datasets and, even if we do not inject prior knowledge, our method adapts to the data and overcomes the state-of-the-art.",0
"The primary challenge in 3D mesh classification is assigning a label to each facet from a set of possible options, which is known as mesh labeling.

"One of the problems on the way to successful implementation of neural networks is the quality of annotation. For instance, different annotators can annotate images in a different way and very often their decisions do not match exactly and in extreme cases are even mutually exclusive which results in noisy annotations and, consequently, inaccurate predictions.   To avoid that problem in the task of computed tomography (CT) imaging segmentation we propose a clearing algorithm for annotations. It consists of 3 stages:   - annotators scoring, which assigns a higher confidence level to better annotators;   - nodules scoring, which assigns a higher confidence level to nodules confirmed by good annotators;   - nodules merging, which aggregates annotations according to nodules confidence.   In general, the algorithm can be applied to many different tasks (namely, binary and multi-class semantic segmentation, and also with trivial adjustments to classification and regression) where there are several annotators labeling each image.",0
"The success of neural network implementation can be hindered by the issue of annotation quality. This is because different annotators can interpret images differently, leading to discrepancies in their decisions and ultimately producing inaccurate predictions. To address this issue in the context of computed tomography (CT) imaging segmentation, we propose a clearing algorithm for annotations. This algorithm involves three stages: annotator scoring to assign higher confidence to more reliable annotators, nodule scoring to assign higher confidence to nodules confirmed by trustworthy annotators, and nodule merging to aggregate annotations based on nodule confidence. This algorithm can be adapted for various tasks, including binary and multi-class semantic segmentation, classification, and regression, where multiple annotators are involved in image labeling.",1
"White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is commonly found in elder individuals and appears to be associated with brain diseases. U-net is a convolutional network that has been widely used for biomedical image segmentation. Recently, U-net has been successfully applied to WMH segmentation. Random initialization is usally used to initialize the model weights in the U-net. However, the model may coverage to different local optima with different randomly initialized weights. We find a combination of thresholding and averaging the outputs of U-nets with different random initializations can largely improve the WMH segmentation accuracy. Based on this observation, we propose a post-processing technique concerning the way how averaging and thresholding are conducted. Specifically, we first transfer the score maps from three U-nets to binary masks via thresholding and then average those binary masks to obtain the final WMH segmentation. Both quantitative analysis (via the Dice similarity coefficient) and qualitative analysis (via visual examinations) reveal the superior performance of the proposed method. This post-processing technique is independent of the model used. As such, it can also be applied to situations where other deep learning models are employed, especially when random initialization is adopted and pre-training is unavailable.",0

"Deep neural network architectures have traditionally been designed and explored with human expertise in a long-lasting trial-and-error process.

"In this paper, we present UNet++, a new, more powerful architecture for medical image segmentation. Our architecture is essentially a deeply-supervised encoder-decoder network where the encoder and decoder sub-networks are connected through a series of nested, dense skip pathways. The re-designed skip pathways aim at reducing the semantic gap between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. We argue that the optimizer would deal with an easier learning task when the feature maps from the decoder and encoder networks are semantically similar. We have evaluated UNet++ in comparison with U-Net and wide U-Net architectures across multiple medical image segmentation tasks: nodule segmentation in the low-dose CT scans of chest, nuclei segmentation in the microscopy images, liver segmentation in abdominal CT scans, and polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos.

"We propose a novel method for learning convolutional neural image representations without manual supervision. We use motion cues in the form of optical flow, to supervise representations of static images. The obvious approach of training a network to predict flow from a single image can be needlessly difficult due to intrinsic ambiguities in this prediction task. We instead propose a much simpler learning goal: embed pixels such that the similarity between their embeddings matches that between their optical flow vectors. At test time, the learned deep network can be used without access to video or flow information and transferred to tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation. Our method, which significantly simplifies previous attempts at using motion for self-supervision, achieves state-of-the-art results in self-supervision using motion cues, competitive results for self-supervision in general, and is overall state of the art in self-supervised pretraining for semantic image segmentation, as demonstrated on standard benchmarks.",0

"Over the past decades, state-of-the-art medical image segmentation has heavily rested on signal processing paradigms, most notably registration-based label propagation and pair-wise patch comparison, which are generally slow despite a high segmentation accuracy. In recent years, deep learning has revolutionalized computer vision with many practices outperforming prior art, in particular the convolutional neural network (CNN) studies on image classification. Deep CNN has also started being applied to medical image segmentation lately, but generally involves long training and demanding memory requirements, achieving limited success. We propose a patch-based deep learning framework based on a revisit to the classic neural network model with substantial modernization, including the use of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, dropout layers, 2.5D tri-planar patch multi-pathway settings. In a test application to hippocampus segmentation using 100 brain MR images from the ADNI database, our approach significantly outperformed prior art in terms of both segmentation accuracy and speed: scoring a median Dice score up to 90.98% on a near real-time performance (<1s).",0

Semantic segmentation of medical images is a crucial step for the quantification of healthy anatomy and diseases alike. The majority of the current state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms are based on deep neural networks and rely on large datasets with full pixel-wise annotations. Producing such annotations can often only be done by medical professionals and requires large amounts of valuable time. Training a medical image segmentation network with weak annotations remains a relatively unexplored topic. In this work we investigate training strategies to learn the parameters of a pixel-wise segmentation network from scribble annotations alone. We evaluate the techniques on public cardiac (ACDC) and prostate (NCI-ISBI) segmentation datasets. We find that the networks trained on scribbles suffer from a remarkably small degradation in Dice of only 2.9% (cardiac) and 4.5% (prostate) with respect to a network trained on full annotations.,0

"Unpaired image-to-image translation is the problem of mapping an image in the source domain to one in the target domain, without requiring corresponding image pairs. To ensure the translated images are realistically plausible, recent works, such as Cycle-GAN, demands this mapping to be invertible. While, this requirement demonstrates promising results when the domains are unimodal, its performance is unpredictable in a multi-modal scenario such as in an image segmentation task. This is because, invertibility does not necessarily enforce semantic correctness. To this end, we present a semantically-consistent GAN framework, dubbed Sem-GAN, in which the semantics are defined by the class identities of image segments in the source domain as produced by a semantic segmentation algorithm. Our proposed framework includes consistency constraints on the translation task that, together with the GAN loss and the cycle-constraints, enforces that the images when translated will inherit the appearances of the target domain, while (approximately) maintaining their identities from the source domain. We present experiments on several image-to-image translation tasks and demonstrate that Sem-GAN improves the quality of the translated images significantly, sometimes by more than 20% on the FCN score. Further, we show that semantic segmentation models, trained with synthetic images translated via Sem-GAN, leads to significantly better segmentation results than other variants.",0

"Yield and its prediction is one of the most important tasks in grapevine breeding purposes and vineyard management. Commonly, this trait is estimated manually right before harvest by extrapolation, which mostly is labor-intensive, destructive and inaccurate. In the present study an automated image-based workflow was developed quantifying inflorescences and single flowers in unprepared field images of grapevines, i.e. no artificial background or light was applied. It is a novel approach for non-invasive, inexpensive and objective phenotyping with high-throughput.   First, image regions depicting inflorescences were identified and localized. This was done by segmenting the images into the classes ""inflorescence"" and ""non-inflorescence"" using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). Efficient image segmentation hereby is the most challenging step regarding the small geometry and dense distribution of flowers (several hundred flowers per inflorescence), similar color of all plant organs in the fore- and background as well as the circumstance that only approximately 5% of an image show inflorescences. The trained FCN achieved a mean Intersection Over Union (IOU) of 87.6% on the test data set.

"Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. To assist doctors in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment planning, an accurate and automatic liver and tumor segmentation method is highly demanded in the clinical practice.

However, 2D convolutions can not fully leverage the spatial information along the third dimension while 3D convolutions suffer from high computational cost and GPU memory consumption. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid densely connected UNet (H-DenseUNet), which consists of a 2D DenseUNet for efficiently extracting intra-slice features and a 3D counterpart for hierarchically aggregating volumetric contexts under the spirit of the auto-context algorithm for liver and tumor segmentation. We formulate the learning process of H-DenseUNet in an end-to-end manner, where the intra-slice representations and inter-slice features can be jointly optimized through a hybrid feature fusion (HFF) layer. We extensively evaluated our method on the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge and 3DIRCADb Dataset. Our method outperformed other state-of-the-arts on the segmentation results of tumors and achieved very competitive performance for liver segmentation even with a single model.",0
"Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and there is a high demand for an accurate and automatic liver and tumor segmentation method to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning for hepatocellular carcinoma.

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly important due to their excellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However, regularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the complex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring function complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive regularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in statistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based approximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural networks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the literature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating the necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound for functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic optimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the improved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex function sets as well as DNNs on real-world classification and image segmentation tasks demonstrating improved performance over weight decay, dropout, and batch normalization. Source code will be released at the time of publication.",0

"One of the time-consuming routine work for a radiologist is to discern anatomical structures from tomographic images. For assisting radiologists, this paper develops an automatic segmentation method for pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) images. The task has three major challenges 1) A pelvic organ can have various sizes and shapes depending on the axial image, which requires local contexts to segment correctly. 2) Different organs often have quite similar appearance in MR images, which requires global context to segment. 3) The number of available annotated images are very small to use the latest segmentation algorithms. To address the challenges, we propose a novel convolutional neural network called Attention-Pyramid network (APNet) that effectively exploits both local and global contexts, in addition to a data-augmentation technique that is particularly effective for MR images. In order to evaluate our method, we construct fine-grained (50 pelvic organs) MR image segmentation dataset, and experimentally confirm the superior performance of our techniques over the state-of-the-art image segmentation methods.",0

"We introduce an approach for image segmentation based on sparse correspondences between keypoints in testing and training images. Keypoints represent automatically identified distinctive image locations, where each keypoint correspondence suggests a transformation between images. We use these correspondences to transfer label maps of entire organs from the training images to the test image. The keypoint transfer algorithm includes three steps: (i) keypoint matching, (ii) voting-based keypoint labeling, and (iii) keypoint-based probabilistic transfer of organ segmentations. We report segmentation results for abdominal organs in whole-body CT and MRI, as well as in contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Our method offers a speed-up of about three orders of magnitude in comparison to common multi-atlas segmentation, while achieving an accuracy that compares favorably. Moreover, keypoint transfer does not require the registration to an atlas or a training phase. Finally, the method allows for the segmentation of scans with highly variable field-of-view.",0

"Automated medical image segmentation, specifically using deep learning, has shown outstanding performance in semantic segmentation tasks. However, these methods rarely quantify their uncertainty, which may lead to errors in downstream analysis. In this work we propose to use Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainty within the domain of semantic segmentation. We also propose a method to convert voxel-wise segmentation uncertainty into volumetric uncertainty, and calibrate the accuracy and reliability of confidence intervals of derived measurements. When applied to a tumour volume estimation application, we demonstrate that by using such modelling of uncertainty, deep learning systems can be made to report volume estimates with well-calibrated error-bars, making them safer for clinical use. We also show that the uncertainty estimates extrapolate to unseen data, and that the confidence intervals are robust in the presence of artificial noise. This could be used to provide a form of quality control and quality assurance, and may permit further adoption of deep learning tools in the clinic.",0

"Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is an imaging technique that assesses left ventricle function and myocardial perfusion for the detection of coronary artery diseases. Automatic MCE perfusion quantification is challenging and requires accurate segmentation of the myocardium from noisy and time-varying images. Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to many medical image segmentation tasks. However, the pixel-wise RF classifier ignores contextual relationships between label outputs of individual pixels. RF which only utilizes local appearance features is also susceptible to data suffering from large intensity variations. In this paper, we demonstrate how to overcome the above limitations of classic RF by presenting a fully automatic segmentation pipeline for myocardial segmentation in full-cycle 2D MCE data. Specifically, a statistical shape model is used to provide shape prior information that guide the RF segmentation in two ways. First, a novel shape model (SM) feature is incorporated into the RF framework to generate a more accurate RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF probability map to refine and constrain the final segmentation to plausible myocardial shapes. We further improve the performance by introducing a bounding box detection algorithm as a preprocessing step in the segmentation pipeline. Our approach on 2D image is further extended to 2D+t sequence which ensures temporal consistency in the resultant sequence segmentations. When evaluated on clinical MCE data, our proposed method achieves notable improvement in segmentation accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods including the classic RF and its variants, active shape model and image registration.",0

"Convolutional networks (ConvNets) have achieved great successes in various challenging vision tasks. However, the performance of ConvNets would degrade when encountering the domain shift. The domain adaptation is more significant while challenging in the field of biomedical image analysis, where cross-modality data have largely different distributions. Given that annotating the medical data is especially expensive, the supervised transfer learning approaches are not quite optimal. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework with adversarial learning for cross-modality biomedical image segmentations. Specifically, our model is based on a dilated fully convolutional network for pixel-wise prediction. Moreover, we build a plug-and-play domain adaptation module (DAM) to map the target input to features which are aligned with source domain feature space. A domain critic module (DCM) is set up for discriminating the feature space of both domains. We optimize the DAM and DCM via an adversarial loss without using any target domain label. Our proposed method is validated by adapting a ConvNet trained with MRI images to unpaired CT data for cardiac structures segmentations, and achieved very promising results.",0

"Semantic image segmentation plays an important role in modeling patient-specific anatomy. We propose a convolution neural network, called Kid-Net, along with a training schema to segment kidney vessels: artery, vein and collecting system. Such segmentation is vital during the surgical planning phase in which medical decisions are made before surgical incision. Our main contribution is developing a training schema that handles unbalanced data, reduces false positives and enables high-resolution segmentation with a limited memory budget. These objectives are attained using dynamic weighting, random sampling and 3D patch segmentation. Manual medical image annotation is both time-consuming and expensive. Kid-Net reduces kidney vessels segmentation time from matter of hours to minutes. It is trained end-to-end using 3D patches from volumetric CT-images. A complete segmentation for a 512x512x512 CT-volume is obtained within a few minutes (1-2 mins) by stitching the output 3D patches together. Feature down-sampling and up-sampling are utilized to achieve higher classification and localization accuracies.

"Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies.

The complementary pathway extracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to brain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on the OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the two-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is verified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its invariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network design is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation problems with better generalization.",0

"Recent advances in deep learning based image segmentation methods have enabled real-time performance with human-level accuracy. However, occasionally even the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected behaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality in the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice, but also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in subsequent analysis.   In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality control for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning. First, we train a neural network on 12,880 samples to predict Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) on a per-case basis. We report a mean average error (MAE) of 0.03 on 1,610 test samples and 97% binary classification accuracy for separating low and high quality segmentations. Secondly, in the scenario where no manually annotated data is available, we train a network to predict DSC scores from estimated quality obtained via a reverse testing strategy. We report an MAE=0.14 and 91% binary classification accuracy for this case. Predictions are obtained in real-time which, when combined with real-time segmentation methods, enables instant feedback on whether an acquired scan is analysable while the patient is still in the scanner. This further enables new applications of optimising image acquisition towards best possible analysis results.",0

"Automatic parsing of anatomical objects in X-ray images is critical to many clinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow automation. Existing deep network models require a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining accurate pixel-wise labeling in X-ray images relies heavily on skilled clinicians due to the large overlaps of anatomy and the complex texture patterns. On the other hand, organs in 3D CT scans preserve clearer structures as well as sharper boundaries and thus can be easily delineated. In this paper, we propose a novel model framework for learning automatic X-ray image parsing from labeled CT scans. Specifically, a Dense Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. Then we introduce a Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN) architecture to achieve simultaneous style transfer and parsing for unseen real X-ray images. TD-GAN consists of a modified cycle-GAN substructure for pixel-to-pixel translation between DRRs and X-ray images and an added module leveraging the pre-trained DI2I to enforce segmentation consistency. The TD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and 153 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 85% which achieves the same level accuracy of supervised training (88%).",0

Typical instances of hourglass networks contain shortcut connections between mirroring layers. These shortcut connections improve the performance and it is hypothesized that this is due to mitigating effects on the vanishing gradient problem and the ability of the model to combine feature maps from earlier and later layers. We propose a method for not only combining feature maps of mirroring layers but also feature maps of layers with different spatial dimensions. For instance, the method enables the integration of the bottleneck feature map with those of the reconstruction layers. The proposed approach is applicable to any hourglass architecture. We evaluated the contextual hourglass networks on image segmentation and object counting problems in the medical domain. We achieve competitive results outperforming popular hourglass networks by up to 17 percentage points.",0

"Uncertainty estimation methods are expected to improve the understanding and quality of computer-assisted methods used in medical applications (e.g., neurosurgical interventions, radiotherapy planning), where automated medical image segmentation is crucial. In supervised machine learning, a common practice to generate ground truth label data is to merge observer annotations. However, as many medical image tasks show a high inter-observer variability resulting from factors such as image quality, different levels of user expertise and domain knowledge, little is known as to how inter-observer variability and commonly used fusion methods affect the estimation of uncertainty of automated image segmentation. In this paper we analyze the effect of common image label fusion techniques on uncertainty estimation, and propose to learn the uncertainty among observers. The results highlight the negative effect of fusion methods applied in deep learning, to obtain reliable estimates of segmentation uncertainty. Additionally, we show that the learned observers' uncertainty can be combined with current standard Monte Carlo dropout Bayesian neural networks to characterize uncertainty of model's parameters.",0

"Semantic image segmentation is one the most demanding task, especially for analysis of traffic conditions for self-driving cars. Here the results of application of several deep learning architectures (PSPNet and ICNet) for semantic image segmentation of traffic stereo-pair images are presented. The images from Cityscapes dataset and custom urban images were analyzed as to the segmentation accuracy and image inference time. For the models pre-trained on Cityscapes dataset, the inference time was equal in the limits of standard deviation, but the segmentation accuracy was different for various cities and stereo channels even. The distributions of accuracy (mean intersection over union - mIoU) values for each city and channel are asymmetric, long-tailed, and have many extreme outliers, especially for PSPNet network in comparison to ICNet network. Some statistical properties of these distributions (skewness, kurtosis) allow us to distinguish these two networks and open the question about relations between architecture of deep learning networks and statistical distribution of the predicted results (mIoU here). The results obtained demonstrated the different sensitivity of these networks to: (1) the local street view peculiarities in different cities that should be taken into account during the targeted fine tuning the models before their practical applications, (2) the right and left data channels in stereo-pairs. For both networks, the difference in the predicted results (mIoU here) for the right and left data channels in stereo-pairs is out of the limits of statistical error in relation to mIoU values. It means that the traffic stereo pairs can be effectively used not only for depth calculations (as it is usually used), but also as an additional data channel that can provide much more information about scene objects than simple duplication of the same street view images.",0

"Recent neural-network-based architectures for image segmentation make extensive usage of feature forwarding mechanisms to integrate information from multiple scales. Although yielding good results, even deeper architectures and alternative methods for feature fusion at different resolutions have been scarcely investigated for medical applications. In this work we propose to implement segmentation via an encoder-decoder architecture which differs from any other previously published method since (i) it employs a very deep architecture based on residual learning and (ii) combines features via a convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), instead of concatenation or summation. The intuition is that the memory mechanism implemented by LSTMs can better integrate features from different scales through a coarse-to-fine strategy; hence the name Coarse-to-Fine Context Memory (CFCM). We demonstrate the remarkable advantages of this approach on two datasets: the Montgomery county lung segmentation dataset, and the EndoVis 2015 challenge dataset for surgical instrument segmentation.",0

"In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have become powerful tools for biomedical image segmentation. However, high annotation efforts and costs are commonly needed to acquire sufficient biomedical training data for DL models. To alleviate the burden of manual annotation, in this paper, we propose a new weakly supervised DL approach for biomedical image segmentation using boxes only annotation. First, we develop a method to combine graph search (GS) and DL to generate fine object masks from box annotation, in which DL uses box annotation to compute a rough segmentation for GS and then GS is applied to locate the optimal object boundaries. During the mask generation process, we carefully utilize information from box annotation to filter out potential errors, and then use the generated masks to train an accurate DL segmentation network. Extensive experiments on gland segmentation in histology images, lymph node segmentation in ultrasound images, and fungus segmentation in electron microscopy images show that our approach attains superior performance over the best known state-of-the-art weakly supervised DL method and is able to achieve (1) nearly the same accuracy compared to fully supervised DL methods with far less annotation effort, (2) significantly better results with similar annotation time, and (3) robust performance in various applications.",0

"Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to carry out inference over an image. These models typically involve unary potentials based on local appearance features computed by FCNs, and binary potentials based on the displacement between pixels. We show that while current methods succeed in segmenting whole objects, they perform poorly in situations involving a large number of object parts. We therefore suggest incorporating into the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the way humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were shown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment - into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal VOC Parts dataset. Our experimental results show that the segmentation of fine parts is positively affected by the addition of these two relations, and that the segmentation of fine parts can be further influenced by complex structural features.",0

"For the challenging semantic image segmentation task the most efficient models have traditionally combined the structured modelling capabilities of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with the feature extraction power of CNNs. In more recent works however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that this is mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as the difficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues we propose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework of fully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms of convolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs. Doing so speeds up inference and training by a factor of more then 100. All parameters of the convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. To facilitating further CRF research we make our implementation publicly available.

"Urban facade segmentation from automatically acquired imagery, in contrast to traditional image segmentation, poses several unique challenges. 360-degree photospheres captured from vehicles are an effective way to capture a large number of images, but this data presents difficult-to-model warping and stitching artifacts. In addition, each pixel can belong to multiple facade elements, and different facade elements (e.g., window, balcony, sill, etc.) are correlated and vary wildly in their characteristics. In this paper, we propose three network architectures of varying complexity to achieve multilabel semantic segmentation of facade images while exploiting their unique characteristics. Specifically, we propose a MULTIFACSEGNET architecture to assign multiple labels to each pixel, a SEPARABLE architecture as a low-rank formulation that encourages extraction of rectangular elements, and a COMPATIBILITY network that simultaneously seeks segmentation across facade element types allowing the network to 'see' intermediate output probabilities of the various facade element classes. Our results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements over existing facade segmentation approaches for the typical facade elements. For example, on one commonly used dataset, the accuracy scores for window(the most important architectural element) increases from 0.91 to 0.97 percent compared to the best competing method, and comparable improvements on other element types.",0

"Due to low tissue contrast, irregular object appearance, and unpredictable location variation, segmenting the objects from different medical imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MR) is considered as an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel method for interactive medical image segmentation with the following merits. (1) Our design is fundamentally different from previous pure patch-based and image-based segmentation methods. We observe that during delineation, the physician repeatedly check the inside-outside intensity changing to determine the boundary, which indicates that comparison in an inside-outside manner is extremely important. Thus, we innovatively model our segmentation task as learning the representation of the bi-directional sequential patches, starting from (or ending in) the given central point of the object. This can be realized by our proposed ConvRNN network embedded with a gated memory propagation unit. (2) Unlike previous interactive methods (requiring bounding box or seed points), we only ask the physician to merely click on the rough central point of the object before segmentation, which could simultaneously enhance the performance and reduce the segmentation time. (3) We utilize our method in a multi-level framework for better performance.

"Segmenting objects from medical imaging modalities such as CT and MR is a challenging task due to low tissue contrast, irregular object appearance, and unpredictable location variation. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for interactive medical image segmentation that offers several advantages. First, our approach differs from previous patch-based and image-based segmentation methods, as we recognize the importance of comparison in an inside-outside manner during delineation. We model the segmentation task as learning the representation of bi-directional sequential patches using our proposed ConvRNN network with a gated memory propagation unit. Second, unlike previous interactive methods that require bounding box or seed points, we only ask the physician to click on the rough central point of the object before segmentation, which enhances performance and reduces segmentation time. Third, we use our method in a multi-level framework for better performance. We evaluate our method in three different segmentation tasks, including CT kidney tumor, MR prostate, and PROMISE12 challenge, and demonstrate promising results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

"State-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches increase the receptive field of their models by using either a downsampling path composed of poolings/strided convolutions or successive dilated convolutions. However, it is not clear which operation leads to best results. In this paper, we systematically study the differences introduced by distinct receptive field enlargement methods and their impact on the performance of a novel architecture, called Fully Convolutional DenseResNet (FC-DRN). FC-DRN has a densely connected backbone composed of residual networks. Following standard image segmentation architectures, receptive field enlargement operations that change the representation level are interleaved among residual networks. This allows the model to exploit the benefits of both residual and dense connectivity patterns, namely: gradient flow, iterative refinement of representations, multi-scale feature combination and deep supervision. In order to highlight the potential of our model, we test it on the challenging CamVid urban scene understanding benchmark and make the following observations: 1) downsampling operations outperform dilations when the model is trained from scratch, 2) dilations are useful during the finetuning step of the model, 3) coarser representations require less refinement steps, and 4) ResNets (by model construction) are good regularizers, since they can reduce the model capacity when needed. Finally, we compare our architecture to alternative methods and report state-of-the-art result on the Camvid dataset, with at least twice fewer parameters.",0

"Machine learning models produce state-of-the-art results in many MRI images segmentation. However, most of these models are trained on very large datasets which come from experts manual labeling. This labeling process is very time consuming and costs experts work. Therefore finding a way to reduce this cost is on high demand. In this paper, we propose a segmentation method which exploits MRI images sequential structure to nearly drop out this labeling task. Only the first slice needs to be manually labeled to train the model which then infers the next slice's segmentation. Inference result is another datum used to train the model again. The updated model then infers the third slice and the same process is carried out until the last slice. The proposed model is an combination of two Random Forest algorithms: the classical one and a recent one namely Mondrian Forests. We applied our method on human left ventricle segmentation and results are very promising. This method can also be used to generate labels.",0

"We present a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images.

The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material. Experiments on multiple semantic segmentation datasets show that the presented approach yields considerably more realistic images than recent purely parametric techniques.

"Many imaging tasks require global information about all pixels in an image. Conventional bottom-up classification networks globalize information by decreasing resolution; features are pooled and downsampled into a single output. But for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, a network must provide higher-resolution pixel-level outputs. To globalize information while preserving resolution, many researchers propose the inclusion of sophisticated auxiliary blocks, but these come at the cost of a considerable increase in network size and computational cost. This paper proposes stacked u-nets (SUNets), which iteratively combine features from different resolution scales while maintaining resolution. SUNets leverage the information globalization power of u-nets in a deeper network architectures that is capable of handling the complexity of natural images. SUNets perform extremely well on semantic segmentation tasks using a small number of parameters.",0

"In the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is important to be able to functionalize surfaces chemically for a wide variety of applications. Scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) are important instruments in this area used to measure the surface structure and chemistry with better than molecular resolution. Self-assembly is frequently used to create monolayers that redefine the surface chemistry in just a single-molecule-thick layer. Indeed, STM images reveal rich information about the structure of self-assembled monolayers since they convey chemical and physical properties of the studied material.   In order to assist in and to enhance the analysis of STM and other images, we propose and demonstrate an image-processing framework that produces two image segmentations: one is based on intensities (apparent heights in STM images) and the other is based on textural patterns. The proposed framework begins with a cartoon+texture decomposition, which separates an image into its cartoon and texture components. Afterward, the cartoon image is segmented by a modified multiphase version of the local Chan-Vese model, while the texture image is segmented by a combination of 2D empirical wavelet transform and a clustering algorithm. Overall, our proposed framework contains several new features, specifically in presenting a new application of cartoon+texture decomposition and of the empirical wavelet transforms and in developing a specialized framework to segment STM images and other data.

"America has a massive railway system. As of 2006, U.S. freight railroads have 140,490 route- miles of standard gauge, but maintaining such a huge system and eliminating any dangers, like reduced track stability and poor drainage, caused by railway ballast degradation require huge amount of labor. The traditional way to quantify the degradation of ballast is to use an index called Fouling Index (FI) through ballast sampling and sieve analysis. However, determining the FI values in lab is very time-consuming and laborious, but with the help of recent development in the field of computer vision, a novel method for a potential machine-vison based ballast inspection system can be employed that can hopefully replace the traditional mechanical method. The new machine-vision approach analyses the images of the in-service ballasts, and then utilizes image segmentation algorithm to get ballast segments. By comparing the segment results and their corresponding FI values, this novel method produces a machine-vision-based index that has the best-fit relation with FI. The implementation details of how this algorithm works are discussed in this report.",0

"We present a multilinear statistical model of the human tongue that captures anatomical and tongue pose related shape variations separately.

"We propose a novel locally adaptive learning estimator for enhancing the inter- and intra- discriminative capabilities of Deep Neural Networks, which can be used as improved loss layer for semantic image segmentation tasks. Most loss layers compute pixel-wise cost between feature maps and ground truths, ignoring spatial layouts and interactions between neighboring pixels with same object category, and thus networks cannot be effectively sensitive to intra-class connections. Stride by stride, our method firstly conducts adaptive pooling filter operating over predicted feature maps, aiming to merge predicted distributions over a small group of neighboring pixels with same category, and then it computes cost between the merged distribution vector and their category label. Such design can make groups of neighboring predictions from same category involved into estimations on predicting correctness with respect to their category, and hence train networks to be more sensitive to regional connections between adjacent pixels based on their categories. In the experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation datasets, the consistently improved results show that our proposed approach achieves better segmentation masks against previous counterparts.",0

In this paper, we present a simple but effective sample selection method for training multi-organ segmentation networks. Sample selection exhibits an exploitation-exploration strategy, i.e., exploiting hard samples and exploring less frequently visited samples. Based on the fact that very hard samples might have annotation errors, we propose a new sample selection policy, named Relaxed Upper Confident Bound (RUCB). Compared with other sample selection policies, e.g., Upper Confident Bound (UCB), it exploits a range of hard samples rather than being stuck with a small set of very hard ones, which mitigates the influence of annotation errors during training. We apply this new sample selection policy to training a multi-organ segmentation network on a dataset containing 120 abdominal CT scans and show that it boosts segmentation performance significantly.",0

"Examining locomotion has improved our basic understanding of motor control and aided in treating motor impairment. Mice and rats are the model system of choice for basic neuroscience studies of human disease. High frame rates are needed to quantify the kinematics of running rodents, due to their high stride frequency. Manual tracking, especially for multiple body landmarks, becomes extremely time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the use of superpixels based image segmentation as superpixels utilized both spatial and color information for segmentation. We segmented some parts of body and tested the success of segmentation as a function of color space and SLIC segment size. We used a simple merging function to connect the segmented regions considered as neighbor and having the same intensity value range. In addition, 28 features were extracted, and t-SNE was used to demonstrate how much the methods are capable to differentiate the regions. Finally, we compared the segmented regions to a manually outlined region. The results showed for segmentation, using the RGB image was slightly better compared to the hue channel.

"The study of locomotion has enhanced our fundamental comprehension of motor control and has contributed to the treatment of motor impairment. To investigate human diseases, mice and rats are the preferred model system for basic neuroscience research. Because of their high stride frequency, analyzing the kinematics of running rodents requires high frame rates. Manual tracking of multiple body landmarks can be extremely time-consuming. To address these issues, we proposed using superpixels based image segmentation, which incorporates both spatial and color information for segmentation. We segmented certain body parts and tested the effectiveness of segmentation as a function of color space and SLIC segment size. We used a simple merging function to connect the segmented regions that were considered neighboring and had the same intensity value range. Additionally, we extracted 28 features, and t-SNE was used to demonstrate the ability of the methods to differentiate the regions.

"Image foreground extraction is a classical problem in image processing and vision, with a large range of applications. In this dissertation, we focus on the extraction of text and graphics in mixed-content images, and design novel approaches for various aspects of this problem.   We first propose a sparse decomposition framework, which models the background by a subspace containing smooth basis vectors, and foreground as a sparse and connected component. We then formulate an optimization framework to solve this problem, by adding suitable regularizations to the cost function to promote the desired characteristics of each component. We present two techniques to solve the proposed optimization problem, one based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and the other one based on robust regression. Promising results are obtained for screen content image segmentation using the proposed algorithm.   We then propose a robust subspace learning algorithm for the representation of the background component using training images that could contain both background and foreground components, as well as noise. With the learnt subspace for the background, we can further improve the segmentation results, compared to using a fixed subspace. Lastly, we investigate a different class of signal/image decomposition problem, where only one signal component is active at each signal element. In this case, besides estimating each component, we need to find their supports, which can be specified by a binary mask. We propose a mixed-integer programming problem, that jointly estimates the two components and their supports through an alternating optimization scheme. We show the application of this algorithm on various problems, including image segmentation, video motion segmentation, and also separation of text from textured images.",0

"Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional random fields (SP-HO-CRFs) are known for their effectiveness in enforcing both short and long spatial contiguity for pixelwise labelling in computer vision. However, their higher-order potentials are usually too complex to learn and often incur a high computational cost in performing inference. We propose an new approximation approach to SP-HO-CRFs that resolves these problems. Our approach is a multi-layer CRF framework that inherits the simplicity from pairwise CRFs by formulating both the higher-order and pairwise cues into the same pairwise potentials in the first layer. Essentially, this approach provides accuracy enhancement on the basis of pairwise CRFs without training by reusing their pre-trained parameters and/or weights. The proposed multi-layer approach performs especially well in delineating the boundary details (boarders) of object categories such as ""trees"" and ""bushes"". Multiple sets of experiments conducted on dataset MSRC-21 and PASCAL VOC 2012 validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.",0

"The Normalized Cut (NCut) objective function, widely used in data clustering and image segmentation, quantifies the cost of graph partitioning in a way that biases clusters or segments that are balanced towards having lower values than unbalanced partitionings. However, this bias is so strong that it avoids any singleton partitions, even when vertices are very weakly connected to the rest of the graph. Motivated by the B\""uhler-Hein family of balanced cut costs, we propose the family of Compassionately Conservative Balanced (CCB) Cut costs, which are indexed by a parameter that can be used to strike a compromise between the desire to avoid too many singleton partitions and the notion that all partitions should be balanced. We show that CCB-Cut minimization can be relaxed into an orthogonally constrained $\ell_{\tau}$-minimization problem that coincides with the problem of computing Piecewise Flat Embeddings (PFE) for one particular index value, and we present an algorithm for solving the relaxed problem by iteratively minimizing a sequence of reweighted Rayleigh quotients (IRRQ).

"One of the most common tasks in medical imaging is semantic segmentation.

"Pixelwise segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium and the four cardiac chambers in 2-D steady state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences is an essential preprocessing step for a wide range of analyses. Variability in contrast, appearance, orientation, and placement of the heart between patients, clinical views, scanners, and protocols makes fully automatic semantic segmentation a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we present ${\Omega}$-Net (Omega-Net): a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for simultaneous localization, transformation into a canonical orientation, and semantic segmentation. First, an initial segmentation is performed on the input image, second, the features learned during this initial segmentation are used to predict the parameters needed to transform the input image into a canonical orientation, and third, a final segmentation is performed on the transformed image. In this work, ${\Omega}$-Nets of varying depths were trained to detect five foreground classes in any of three clinical views (short axis, SA, four-chamber, 4C, two-chamber, 2C), without prior knowledge of the view being segmented. The architecture was trained on a cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and healthy control subjects. Network performance as measured by weighted foreground intersection-over-union (IoU) was substantially improved in the best-performing ${\Omega}$- Net compared with U-Net segmentation without localization or orientation. In addition, {\Omega}-Net was retrained from scratch on the 2017 MICCAI ACDC dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the LV and RV bloodpools, and performed slightly worse in segmentation of the LV myocardium.

"Recent advances in 3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) have made it feasible to produce dense voxel-wise predictions of volumetric images. In this work, we show that a multi-class 3D FCN trained on manually labeled CT scans of several anatomical structures (ranging from the large organs to thin vessels) can achieve competitive segmentation results, while avoiding the need for handcrafting features or training class-specific models.   To this end, we propose a two-stage, coarse-to-fine approach that will first use a 3D FCN to roughly define a candidate region, which will then be used as input to a second 3D FCN. This reduces the number of voxels the second FCN has to classify to ~10% and allows it to focus on more detailed segmentation of the organs and vessels.   We utilize training and validation sets consisting of 331 clinical CT images and test our models on a completely unseen data collection acquired at a different hospital that includes 150 CT scans, targeting three anatomical organs (liver, spleen, and pancreas). In challenging organs such as the pancreas, our cascaded approach improves the mean Dice score from 68.5 to 82.2%, achieving the highest reported average score on this dataset. We compare with a 2D FCN method on a separate dataset of 240 CT scans with 18 classes and achieve a significantly higher performance in small organs and vessels.

"This work presents a region-growing image segmentation approach based on superpixel decomposition. From an initial contour-constrained over-segmentation of the input image, the image segmentation is achieved by iteratively merging similar superpixels into regions. This approach raises two key issues: (1) how to compute the similarity between superpixels in order to perform accurate merging and (2) in which order those superpixels must be merged together. In this perspective, we firstly introduce a robust adaptive multi-scale superpixel similarity in which region comparisons are made both at content and common border level. Secondly, we propose a global merging strategy to efficiently guide the region merging process. Such strategy uses an adpative merging criterion to ensure that best region aggregations are given highest priorities. This allows to reach a final segmentation into consistent regions with strong boundary adherence. We perform experiments on the BSDS500 image dataset to highlight to which extent our method compares favorably against other well-known image segmentation algorithms. The obtained results demonstrate the promising potential of the proposed approach.",0
The paper outlines a technique for segmenting images using region-growing and superpixel decomposition. The segmentation process involves merging similar superpixels iteratively to create larger regions. Two primary challenges are addressed: determining the appropriate similarity metric for merging superpixels and selecting the optimal order for merging them. The authors propose a multi-scale superpixel similarity approach that considers both content and common borders. They also introduce a global merging strategy that prioritizes the best region aggregations. The resulting segmentation method produces consistent regions with strong boundary adherence. The method was evaluated on the BSDS500 image dataset and was found to outperform other commonly used image segmentation algorithms. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.,1
"State-of-the-art systems for semantic image segmentation use feed-forward pipelines with fixed computational costs. Building an image segmentation system that works across a range of computational budgets is challenging and time-intensive as new architectures must be designed and trained for every computational setting. To address this problem we develop a recurrent neural network that successively improves prediction quality with each iteration. Importantly, the RNN may be deployed across a range of computational budgets by merely running the model for a variable number of iterations. We find that this architecture is uniquely suited for efficiently segmenting videos. By exploiting the segmentation of past frames, the RNN can perform video segmentation at similar quality but reduced computational cost compared to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods. When applied to static images in the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes segmentation datasets, the RNN traces out a speed-accuracy curve that saturates near the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation methods.",0

"With pervasive applications of medical imaging in health-care, biomedical image segmentation plays a central role in quantitative analysis, clinical diagno- sis, and medical intervention. Since manual anno- tation su ers limited reproducibility, arduous e orts, and excessive time, automatic segmentation is desired to process increasingly larger scale histopathological data. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs), par- ticularly fully convolutional networks (FCNs), have been widely applied to biomedical image segmenta- tion, attaining much improved performance. At the same time, quantization of DNNs has become an ac- tive research topic, which aims to represent weights with less memory (precision) to considerably reduce memory and computation requirements of DNNs while maintaining acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we apply quantization techniques to FCNs for accurate biomedical image segmentation. Unlike existing litera- ture on quantization which primarily targets memory and computation complexity reduction, we apply quan- tization as a method to reduce over tting in FCNs for better accuracy. Speci cally, we focus on a state-of- the-art segmentation framework, suggestive annotation [22], which judiciously extracts representative annota- tion samples from the original training dataset, obtain- ing an e ective small-sized balanced training dataset. We develop two new quantization processes for this framework: (1) suggestive annotation with quantiza- tion for highly representative training samples, and (2) network training with quantization for high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI Gland dataset show that both quantization processes can improve the segmentation performance, and our proposed method exceeds the current state-of-the-art performance by up to 1%.

"Image segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into significant regions easier to analyze. Nowadays, segmentation has become a necessity in many practical medical imaging methods as locating tumors and diseases. Hidden Markov Random Field model is one of several techniques used in image segmentation. It provides an elegant way to model the segmentation process. This modeling leads to the minimization of an objective function. Conjugate Gradient algorithm (CG) is one of the best known optimization techniques. This paper proposes the use of the Conjugate Gradient algorithm (CG) for image segmentation, based on the Hidden Markov Random Field. Since derivatives are not available for this expression, finite differences are used in the CG algorithm to approximate the first derivative.

"Image segmentation is still an open problem especially when intensities of the interested objects are overlapped due to the presence of intensity inhomogeneity (also known as bias field). To segment images with intensity inhomogeneities, a bias correction embedded level set model is proposed where Inhomogeneities are Estimated by Orthogonal Primary Functions (IEOPF). In the proposed model, the smoothly varying bias is estimated by a linear combination of a given set of orthogonal primary functions. An inhomogeneous intensity clustering energy is then defined and membership functions of the clusters described by the level set function are introduced to rewrite the energy as a data term of the proposed model. Similar to popular level set methods, a regularization term and an arc length term are also included to regularize and smooth the level set function, respectively. The proposed model is then extended to multichannel and multiphase patterns to segment colourful images and images with multiple objects, respectively.

"Robust cross-seasonal localization is one of the major challenges in long-term visual navigation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we exploit recent advances in semantic segmentation of images, i.e., where each pixel is assigned a label related to the type of object it represents, to attack the problem of long-term visual localization. We show that semantically labeled 3-D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.). Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization solution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large seasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more descriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m most of the time.",0

"We propose a novel traffic sign detection system that simultaneously estimates the location and precise boundary of traffic signs using convolutional neural network (CNN). Estimating the precise boundary of traffic signs is important in navigation systems for intelligent vehicles where traffic signs can be used as 3D landmarks for road environment. Previous traffic sign detection systems, including recent methods based on CNN, only provide bounding boxes of traffic signs as output, and thus requires additional processes such as contour estimation or image segmentation to obtain the precise sign boundary. In this work, the boundary estimation of traffic signs is formulated as a 2D pose and shape class prediction problem, and this is effectively solved by a single CNN. With the predicted 2D pose and the shape class of a target traffic sign in an input image, we estimate the actual boundary of the target sign by projecting the boundary of a corresponding template sign image into the input image plane. By formulating the boundary estimation problem as a CNN-based pose and shape prediction task, our method is end-to-end trainable, and more robust to occlusion and small targets than other boundary estimation methods that rely on contour estimation or image segmentation. The proposed method with architectural optimization provides an accurate traffic sign boundary estimation which is also efficient in compute, showing a detection frame rate higher than 7 frames per second on low-power mobile platforms.",0

Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the application of this technique to the weakly-supervised segmentation problem.",1
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the major health issues among the elderly population. MRI is the most popular technology to observe and evaluate the progress of OA course. However, the extreme labor cost of MRI analysis makes the process inefficient and expensive. Also, due to human error and subjective nature, the inter- and intra-observer variability is rather high. Computer-aided knee MRI segmentation is currently an active research field because it can alleviate doctors and radiologists from the time consuming and tedious job, and improve the diagnosis performance which has immense potential for both clinic and scientific research. In the past decades, researchers have investigated automatic/semi-automatic knee MRI segmentation methods extensively. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey paper in this field yet. In this survey paper, we classify the existing methods by their principles and discuss the current research status and point out the future research trend in-depth.",0

"Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to problems such as image segmentation, image super-resolution, coloration and image inpainting. In this work we propose the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image inpainting of large regions in high-resolution textures. Due to limited computational resources processing high-resolution images with neural networks is still an open problem. Existing methods separate inpainting of global structure and the transfer of details, which leads to blurry results and loss of global coherence in the detail transfer step. Based on advances in texture synthesis using CNNs we propose patch-based image inpainting by a CNN that is able to optimize for global as well as detail texture statistics. Our method is capable of filling large inpainting regions, oftentimes exceeding the quality of comparable methods for high-resolution images. For reference patch look-up we propose to use the same summary statistics that are used in the inpainting process.",0

"This review presents an in-depth study of the literature on segmentation methods applied in dental imaging. Ten segmentation methods were studied and categorized according to the type of the segmentation method (region-based, threshold-based, cluster-based, boundary-based or watershed-based), type of X-ray images used (intra-oral or extra-oral) and characteristics of the dataset used to evaluate the methods in the state-of-the-art works. We found that the literature has primarily focused on threshold-based segmentation methods (54%). 80% of the reviewed papers have used intra-oral X-ray images in their experiments, demonstrating preference to perform segmentation on images of already isolated parts of the teeth, rather than using extra-oral X-rays, which show tooth structure of the mouth and bones of the face. To fill a scientific gap in the field, a novel data set based on extra-oral X-ray images are proposed here. A statistical comparison of the results found with the 10 image segmentation methods over our proposed data set comprised of 1,500 images is also carried out, providing a more comprehensive source of performance assessment. Discussion on limitations of the methods conceived over the past year as well as future perspectives on exploiting learning-based segmentation methods to improve performance are also provided.",0

"Image segmentation is an important component of many image understanding systems. It aims to group pixels in a spatially and perceptually coherent manner. Typically, these algorithms have a collection of parameters that control the degree of over-segmentation produced. It still remains a challenge to properly select such parameters for human-like perceptual grouping. In this work, we exploit the diversity of segments produced by different choices of parameters. We scan the segmentation parameter space and generate a collection of image segmentation hypotheses (from highly over-segmented to under-segmented). These are fed into a cost minimization framework that produces the final segmentation by selecting segments that: (1) better describe the natural contours of the image, and (2) are more stable and persistent among all the segmentation hypotheses. We compare our algorithm's performance with state-of-the-art algorithms, showing that we can achieve improved results. We also show that our framework is robust to the choice of segmentation kernel that produces the initial set of hypotheses.",0

"Superpixel segmentation has become an important research problem in image processing. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF) framework, based on sequences of Image Foresting Transforms, where one can choose i) a seed sampling strategy, ii) a connectivity function, iii) an adjacency relation, and iv) a seed pixel recomputation procedure to generate improved sets of connected superpixels (supervoxels in 3D) per iteration. The superpixels in ISF structurally correspond to spanning trees rooted at those seeds. We present five ISF methods to illustrate different choices of its components. These methods are compared with approaches from the state-of-the-art in effectiveness and efficiency. The experiments involve 2D and 3D datasets with distinct characteristics, and a high level application, named sky image segmentation.

"Deep convolutional networks for semantic image segmentation typically require large-scale labeled data, e.g. ImageNet and MS COCO, for network pre-training. To reduce annotation efforts, self-supervised semantic segmentation is recently proposed to pre-train a network without any human-provided labels. The key of this new form of learning is to design a proxy task (e.g. image colorization), from which a discriminative loss can be formulated on unlabeled data. Many proxy tasks, however, lack the critical supervision signals that could induce discriminative representation for the target image segmentation task. Thus self-supervision's performance is still far from that of supervised pre-training. In this study, we overcome this limitation by incorporating a ""mix-and-match"" (M&M) tuning stage in the self-supervision pipeline. The proposed approach is readily pluggable to many self-supervision methods and does not use more annotated samples than the original process. Yet, it is capable of boosting the performance of target image segmentation task to surpass fully-supervised pre-trained counterpart. The improvement is made possible by better harnessing the limited pixel-wise annotations in the target dataset. Specifically, we first introduce the ""mix"" stage, which sparsely samples and mixes patches from the target set to reflect rich and diverse local patch statistics of target images. A ""match"" stage then forms a class-wise connected graph, which can be used to derive a strong triplet-based discriminative loss for fine-tuning the network. Our paradigm follows the standard practice in existing self-supervised studies and no extra data or label is required. With the proposed M&M approach, for the first time, a self-supervision method can achieve comparable or even better performance compared to its ImageNet pre-trained counterpart on both PASCAL VOC2012 dataset and CityScapes dataset.",0

"This paper reports Deep LOGISMOS approach to 3D tumor segmentation by incorporating boundary information derived from deep contextual learning to LOGISMOS - layered optimal graph image segmentation of multiple objects and surfaces. Accurate and reliable tumor segmentation is essential to tumor growth analysis and treatment selection. A fully convolutional network (FCN), UNet, is first trained using three adjacent 2D patches centered at the tumor, providing contextual UNet segmentation and probability map for each 2D patch. The UNet segmentation is then refined by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and morphological operations. The refined UNet segmentation is used to provide the initial shape boundary to build a segmentation graph. The cost for each node of the graph is determined by the UNet probability maps. Finally, a max-flow algorithm is employed to find the globally optimal solution thus obtaining the final segmentation. For evaluation, we applied the method to pancreatic tumor segmentation on a dataset of 51 CT scans, among which 30 scans were used for training and 21 for testing. With Deep LOGISMOS, DICE Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Relative Volume Difference (RVD) reached 83.2+-7.8% and 18.6+-17.4% respectively, both are significantly improved (p<0.05) compared with contextual UNet and/or LOGISMOS alone.",0

"Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in medical image analysis. In recent years, deep neural networks achieve impressive performances on many medical image segmentation tasks by supervised learning on large manually annotated data. However, expert annotations on big medical datasets are tedious, expensive or sometimes unavailable. Weakly supervised learning could reduce the effort for annotation but still required certain amounts of expertise. Recently, deep learning shows a potential to produce more accurate predictions than the original erroneous labels. Inspired by this, we introduce a very weakly supervised learning method, for cystic lesion detection and segmentation in lung CT images, without any manual annotation. Our method works in a self-learning manner, where segmentation generated in previous steps (first by unsupervised segmentation then by neural networks) is used as ground truth for the next level of network learning. Experiments on a cystic lung lesion dataset show that the deep learning could perform better than the initial unsupervised annotation, and progressively improve itself after self-learning.",0

"Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform clinical practice in multiple ways including enabling low-cost serial assessment of cardiac function in the primary care and rural setting. We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram (echo) interpretation. Our approach entailed: 1) preprocessing; 2) convolutional neural networks (CNN) for view identification, image segmentation, and phasing of the cardiac cycle; 3) quantification of chamber volumes and left ventricular mass; 4) particle tracking to compute longitudinal strain; and 5) targeted disease detection. CNNs accurately identified views (e.g. 99% for apical 4-chamber) and segmented individual cardiac chambers. Cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (e.g. mean absolute deviations (MAD) of 7.7 mL/kg/m2 for left ventricular diastolic volume index, 2918 studies). We computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values [for ejection fraction, MAD=5.3%, N=3101 studies; for strain, MAD=1.5% (n=197) and 1.6% (n=110)], and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of breast cancer patients for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found that, compared to manual measurements, automated measurements had superior performance across seven internal consistency metrics with an average increase in the Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.05 (p=0.02).

"Early and correct diagnosis is a very important aspect of cancer treatment. Detection of tumour in Computed Tomography scan is a tedious and tricky task which requires expert knowledge and a lot of human working hours. As small human error is present in any work he does, it is possible that a CT scan could be misdiagnosed causing the patient to become terminal. This paper introduces a novel fully automated framework which helps to detect and segment tumour, if present in a lung CT scan series.

It helps to reduce the work of manually going through each CT slice and provides quicker and more accurate tumour diagnosis. It makes use of customized image processing and image segmentation methods, to detect and segment the prospective tumour region from the CT scan. It then uses a trained ensemble classifier to correctly classify the segmented region as being tumour or not. Tumour analysis further computed can then be used to determine malignity of the tumour.

"Semantic image segmentation is one of the most challenged tasks in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a highly fused convolutional network, which consists of three parts: feature downsampling, combined feature upsampling and multiple predictions. We adopt a strategy of multiple steps of upsampling and combined feature maps in pooling layers with its corresponding unpooling layers. Then we bring out multiple pre-outputs, each pre-output is generated from an unpooling layer by one-step upsampling. Finally, we concatenate these pre-outputs to get the final output. As a result, our proposed network makes highly use of the feature information by fusing and reusing feature maps. In addition, when training our model, we add multiple soft cost functions on pre-outputs and final outputs. In this way, we can reduce the loss reduction when the loss is back propagated.

"A novel multi-atlas based image segmentation method is proposed by integrating a semi-supervised label propagation method and a supervised random forests method in a pattern recognition based label fusion framework. The semi-supervised label propagation method takes into consideration local and global image appearance of images to be segmented and segments the images by propagating reliable segmentation results obtained by the supervised random forests method. Particularly, the random forests method is used to train a regression model based on image patches of atlas images for each voxel of the images to be segmented. The regression model is used to obtain reliable segmentation results to guide the label propagation for the segmentation.

"The segmentation of animals from camera-trap images is a difficult task. To illustrate, there are various challenges due to environmental conditions and hardware limitation in these images. We proposed a multi-layer robust principal component analysis (multi-layer RPCA) approach for background subtraction. Our method computes sparse and low-rank images from a weighted sum of descriptors, using color and texture features as case of study for camera-trap images segmentation. The segmentation algorithm is composed of histogram equalization or Gaussian filtering as pre-processing, and morphological filters with active contour as post-processing. The parameters of our multi-layer RPCA were optimized with an exhaustive search. The database consists of camera-trap images from the Colombian forest taken by the Instituto de Investigaci\'on de Recursos Biol\'ogicos Alexander von Humboldt. We analyzed the performance of our method in inherent and therefore challenging situations of camera-trap images. Furthermore, we compared our method with some state-of-the-art algorithms of background subtraction, where our multi-layer RPCA outperformed these other methods. Our multi-layer RPCA reached 76.17 and 69.97% of average fine-grained F-measure for color and infrared sequences, respectively.

"Image segmentation is considered to be one of the critical tasks in hyperspectral remote sensing image processing. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has established itself as a powerful model in segmentation and classification by demonstrating excellent performances. The use of a graphical model such as a conditional random field (CRF) contributes further in capturing contextual information and thus improving the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a method to segment hyperspectral images by considering both spectral and spatial information via a combined framework consisting of CNN and CRF. We use multiple spectral cubes to learn deep features using CNN, and then formulate deep CRF with CNN-based unary and pairwise potential functions to effectively extract the semantic correlations between patches consisting of three-dimensional data cubes. Effective piecewise training is applied in order to avoid the computationally expensive iterative CRF inference. Furthermore, we introduce a deep deconvolution network that improves the segmentation masks.

"We present an end-to-end trainable deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation with built-in awareness of semantically meaningful boundaries. Semantic segmentation is a fundamental remote sensing task, and most state-of-the-art methods rely on DCNNs as their workhorse. A major reason for their success is that deep networks learn to accumulate contextual information over very large windows (receptive fields). However, this success comes at a cost, since the associated loss of effecive spatial resolution washes out high-frequency details and leads to blurry object boundaries. Here, we propose to counter this effect by combining semantic segmentation with semantically informed edge detection, thus making class-boundaries explicit in the model, First, we construct a comparatively simple, memory-efficient model by adding boundary detection to the Segnet encoder-decoder architecture. Second, we also include boundary detection in FCN-type models and set up a high-end classifier ensemble. We show that boundary detection significantly improves semantic segmentation with CNNs. Our high-end ensemble achieves > 90% overall accuracy on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark.",0

"The most common paradigm for vision-based multi-object tracking is tracking-by-detection, due to the availability of reliable detectors for several important object categories such as cars and pedestrians. However, future mobile systems will need a capability to cope with rich human-made environments, in which obtaining detectors for every possible object category would be infeasible. In this paper, we propose a model-free multi-object tracking approach that uses a category-agnostic image segmentation method to track objects. We present an efficient segmentation mask-based tracker which associates pixel-precise masks reported by the segmentation. Our approach can utilize semantic information whenever it is available for classifying objects at the track level, while retaining the capability to track generic unknown objects in the absence of such information. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art tracking-by-detection methods for popular object categories such as cars and pedestrians.

"Precise 3D segmentation of infant brain tissues is an essential step towards comprehensive volumetric studies and quantitative analysis of early brain developement. However, computing such segmentations is very challenging, especially for 6-month infant brain, due to the poor image quality, among other difficulties inherent to infant brain MRI, e.g., the isointense contrast between white and gray matter and the severe partial volume effect due to small brain sizes. This study investigates the problem with an ensemble of semi-dense fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which employs T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images as input. We demonstrate that the ensemble agreement is highly correlated with the segmentation errors. Therefore, our method provides measures that can guide local user corrections.

"The goal of this paper is to present a new efficient image segmentation method based on evolutionary computation which is a model inspired from human behavior. Based on this model, a four layer process for image segmentation is proposed using the split/merge approach. In the first layer, an image is split into numerous regions using the watershed algorithm. In the second layer, a co-evolutionary process is applied to form centers of finals segments by merging similar primary regions. In the third layer, a meta-heuristic process uses two operators to connect the residual regions to their corresponding determined centers. In the final layer, an evolutionary algorithm is used to combine the resulted similar and neighbor regions. Different layers of the algorithm are totally independent, therefore for certain applications a specific layer can be changed without constraint of changing other layers. Some properties of this algorithm like the flexibility of its method, the ability to use different feature vectors for segmentation (grayscale, color, texture, etc), the ability to control uniformity and the number of final segments using free parameters and also maintaining small regions, makes it possible to apply the algorithm to different applications. Moreover, the independence of each region from other regions in the second layer, and the independence of centers in the third layer, makes parallel implementation possible. As a result the algorithm speed will increase. The presented algorithm was tested on a standard dataset (BSDS 300) of images, and the region boundaries were compared with different people segmentation contours. Results show the efficiency of the algorithm and its improvement to similar methods. As an instance, in 70% of tested images, results are better than ACT algorithm, besides in 100% of tested images, we had better results in comparison with VSP algorithm.",0

"According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. It is the second leading cause of death among women round the world, becoming the most fatal form of cancer. Mammographic image segmentation is a fundamental task to support image analysis and diagnosis, taking into account shape analysis of mammary lesions and their borders. However, mammogram segmentation is a very hard process, once it is highly dependent on the types of mammary tissues. In this work we present a new semi-supervised segmentation algorithm based on the modification of the GrowCut algorithm to perform automatic mammographic image segmentation once a region of interest is selected by a specialist. In our proposal, we used fuzzy Gaussian membership functions to modify the evolution rule of the original GrowCut algorithm, in order to estimate the uncertainty of a pixel being object or background. The main impact of the proposed method is the significant reduction of expert effort in the initialization of seed points of GrowCut to perform accurate segmentation, once it removes the need of selection of background seeds.

"With the rapidly increasing interest in machine learning based solutions for automatic image annotation, the availability of reference annotations for algorithm training is one of the major bottlenecks in the field. Crowdsourcing has evolved as a valuable option for low-cost and large-scale data annotation; however, quality control remains a major issue which needs to be addressed. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the annotation process to improve crowd-sourced image segmentation. Our method involves training a regressor to estimate the quality of a segmentation from the annotator's clickstream data. The quality estimation can be used to identify spam and weight individual annotations by their (estimated) quality when merging multiple segmentations of one image. Using a total of 29,000 crowd annotations performed on publicly available data of different object classes, we show that (1) our method is highly accurate in estimating the segmentation quality based on clickstream data, (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods for merging multiple annotations.

Our team is the first to investigate the annotation process to enhance crowd-sourced image segmentation. Our approach involves utilizing a regressor to determine the quality of a segmentation based on the clickstream data of the annotator. This quality estimation can then be used to identify spam and weigh individual annotations based on their estimated quality when merging multiple segmentations of an image. We have conducted experiments on publicly available data of various object classes, incorporating a total of 29,000 crowd annotations, and our results demonstrate that (1) our method is highly accurate in estimating segmentation quality based on clickstream data, and (2) it outperforms existing techniques for merging multiple annotations. Because the regressor can be applied across various object classes, it can be considered a cost-effective solution for quality control and confidence analysis in the context of crowd-based image annotation.",1
"We present the 2017 Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA) dataset and challenge, a large-scale testbed for unsupervised domain adaptation across visual domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to solve the real-world problem of domain shift, where machine learning models trained on one domain must be transferred and adapted to a novel visual domain without additional supervision. The VisDA2017 challenge is focused on the simulation-to-reality shift and has two associated tasks: image classification and image segmentation. The goal in both tracks is to first train a model on simulated, synthetic data in the source domain and then adapt it to perform well on real image data in the unlabeled test domain. Our dataset is the largest one to date for cross-domain object classification, with over 280K images across 12 categories in the combined training, validation and testing domains. The image segmentation dataset is also large-scale with over 30K images across 18 categories in the three domains. We compare VisDA to existing cross-domain adaptation datasets and provide a baseline performance analysis using various domain adaptation models that are currently popular in the field.",0

"This paper presents an efficient automatic color image segmentation method using a seeded region growing and merging method based on square elemental regions. Our segmentation method consists of the three steps: generating seed regions, merging the regions, and applying a pixel-wise boundary determination algorithm to the resultant polygonal regions. The major features of our method are as follows: the use of square elemental regions instead of pixels as the processing unit, a seed generation method based on enhanced gradient values, a seed region growing method exploiting local gradient values, a region merging method using a similarity measure including a homogeneity distance based on Tsallis entropy, and a termination condition of region merging using an estimated desired number of regions. Using square regions as the processing unit substantially reduces the time complexity of the algorithm and makes the performance stable.

"Convolutional neural networks have shown great success on feature extraction from raw input data such as images. Although convolutional neural networks are invariant to translations on the inputs, they are not invariant to other transformations, including rotation and flip. Recent attempts have been made to incorporate more invariance in image recognition applications, but they are not applicable to dense prediction tasks, such as image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a set of methods based on kernel rotation and flip to enable rotation and flip invariance in convolutional neural networks. The kernel rotation can be achieved on kernels of 3 $\times$ 3, while kernel flip can be applied on kernels of any size. By rotating in eight or four angles, the convolutional layers could produce the corresponding number of feature maps based on eight or four different kernels. By using flip, the convolution layer can produce three feature maps. By combining produced feature maps using maxout, the resource requirement could be significantly reduced while still retain the invariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve various invariance at reasonable resource requirements in terms of both memory and time.",0
"Feature extraction from raw input data, particularly images, has been highly successful with the use of convolutional neural networks. Although these networks are able to handle translations in the input, other transformations such as rotation and flip are not easily addressed.

"While significant attention has been recently focused on designing supervised deep semantic segmentation algorithms for vision tasks, there are many domains in which sufficient supervised pixel-level labels are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we revisit the problem of purely unsupervised image segmentation and propose a novel deep architecture for this problem. We borrow recent ideas from supervised semantic segmentation methods, in particular by concatenating two fully convolutional networks together into an autoencoder--one for encoding and one for decoding. The encoding layer produces a k-way pixelwise prediction, and both the reconstruction error of the autoencoder as well as the normalized cut produced by the encoder are jointly minimized during training. When combined with suitable postprocessing involving conditional random field smoothing and hierarchical segmentation, our resulting algorithm achieves impressive results on the benchmark Berkeley Segmentation Data Set, outperforming a number of competing methods.",0

"Motivated by the important archaeological application of exploring cultural heritage objects, in this paper we study the challenging problem of automatically segmenting curve structures that are very weakly stamped or carved on an object surface in the form of a highly noisy depth map. Different from most classical low-level image segmentation methods that are known to be very sensitive to the noise and occlusions, we propose a new supervised learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to implicitly learn and utilize more curve geometry and pattern information for addressing this challenging problem. More specifically, we first propose a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to estimate the skeleton of curve structures and at each skeleton pixel, a scale value is estimated to reflect the local curve width. Then we propose a dense prediction network to refine the estimated curve skeletons. Based on the estimated scale values, we finally develop an adaptive thresholding algorithm to achieve the final segmentation of curve structures. In the experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed method on a dataset of depth images scanned from unearthed pottery sherds dating to the Woodland period of Southeastern North America.",0

"In interactive medical image segmentation, anatomical structures are extracted from reconstructed volumetric images. The first iterations of user interaction traditionally consist of drawing pictorial hints as an initial estimate of the object to extract. Only after this time consuming first phase, the efficient selective refinement of current segmentation results begins. Erroneously labeled seeds, especially near the border of the object, are challenging to detect and replace for a human and may substantially impact the overall segmentation quality. We propose an automatic seeding pipeline as well as a configuration based on saliency recognition, in order to skip the time-consuming initial interaction phase during segmentation. A median Dice score of 68.22% is reached before the first user interaction on the test data set with an error rate in seeding of only 0.088%.",0

"In this paper, a novel label fusion method is proposed for brain magnetic resonance image segmentation. This label fusion method is formulated on a graph, which embraces both label priors from atlases and anatomical priors from target image. To represent a pixel in a comprehensive way, three kinds of feature vectors are generated, including intensity, gradient and structural signature. To select candidate atlas nodes for fusion, rather than exact searching, randomized k-d tree with spatial constraint is introduced as an efficient approximation for high-dimensional feature matching. Feature Sensitive Label Prior (FSLP), which takes both the consistency and variety of different features into consideration, is proposed to gather atlas priors. As FSLP is a non-convex problem, one heuristic approach is further designed to solve it efficiently. Moreover, based on the anatomical knowledge, parts of the target pixels are also employed as graph seeds to assist the label fusion process and an iterative strategy is utilized to gradually update the label map. The comprehensive experiments carried out on two publicly available databases give results to demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain better segmentation quality.",0

"Image analysis using more than one modality (i.e. multi-modal) has been increasingly applied in the field of biomedical imaging. One of the challenges in performing the multimodal analysis is that there exist multiple schemes for fusing the information from different modalities, where such schemes are application-dependent and lack a unified framework to guide their designs. In this work we firstly propose a conceptual architecture for the image fusion schemes in supervised biomedical image analysis: fusing at the feature level, fusing at the classifier level, and fusing at the decision-making level. Further, motivated by the recent success in applying deep learning for natural image analysis, we implement the three image fusion schemes above based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with varied structures, and combined into a single framework.

"We propose an attention mechanism for 3D medical image segmentation. The method, named segmentation-by-detection, is a cascade of a detection module followed by a segmentation module. The detection module enables a region of interest to come to attention and produces a set of object region candidates which are further used as an attention model. Rather than dealing with the entire volume, the segmentation module distills the information from the potential region. This scheme is an efficient solution for volumetric data as it reduces the influence of the surrounding noise which is especially important for medical data with low signal-to-noise ratio.

"State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions.   Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train.

These effects increase the pixel intensity variance of each constituent class, causing intensities from one class to overlap with another. This increased variance makes threshold based segmentation methods insufficient due to ambiguous overlap regions in the pixel intensity distributions. The class ambiguity becomes even more complex for systems with more than two constituents, such as unsaturated moist granular media. In this paper, we propose an image processing workflow that improves segmentation accuracy for multiphase systems. First, the ambiguous transition regions between classes are identified and removed, which allows for global thresholding of single-class regions. Then the transition regions are classified using a distance function, and finally both segmentations are combined into one classified image. This workflow includes three methodologies for identifying transition pixels and we demonstrate on a variety of synthetic images that these approaches are able to accurately separate the ambiguous transition pixels from the single-class regions. For situations with typical amounts of image noise, misclassification errors and area differences calculated between each class of the synthetic images and the resultant segmented images range from 0.69-1.48% and 0.01-0.74%, respectively, showing the segmentation accuracy of this approach. We demonstrate that we are able to accurately segment x-ray microtomography images of moist granular media using these computationally efficient methodologies.",0

"This paper proposes a novel image segmentation approachthat integrates fully convolutional networks (FCNs) with a level setmodel. Compared with a FCN, the integrated method can incorporatesmoothing and prior information to achieve an accurate segmentation.Furthermore, different than using the level set model as a post-processingtool, we integrate it into the training phase to fine-tune the FCN. Thisallows the use of unlabeled data during training in a semi-supervisedsetting. Using two types of medical imaging data (liver CT and left ven-tricle MRI data), we show that the integrated method achieves goodperformance even when little training data is available, outperformingthe FCN or the level set model alone.",0

"In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform deep neural networks layer-wise weight initialization using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Typically, the weights of a deep neural network are initialized with: random values, greedy layer-wise pre-training (usually as Deep Belief Network or as auto-encoder) or by re-using the layers from another network (transfer learning). Hence, many training epochs are needed before meaningful weights are learned, or a rather similar dataset is required for seeding a fine-tuning of transfer learning. In this paper, we describe how to turn an LDA into either a neural layer or a classification layer. We analyze the initialization technique on historical documents. First, we show that an LDA-based initialization is quick and leads to a very stable initialization. Furthermore, for the task of layout analysis at pixel level, we investigate the effectiveness of LDA-based initialization and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art random weight initialization methods.",0

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for automatic medical image segmentation. However, they have not demonstrated sufficiently accurate and robust results for clinical use. In addition, they are limited by the lack of image-specific adaptation and the lack of generalizability to previously unseen object classes. To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for interactive segmentation by incorporating CNNs into a bounding box and scribble-based segmentation pipeline. We propose image-specific fine-tuning to make a CNN model adaptive to a specific test image, which can be either unsupervised (without additional user interactions) or supervised (with additional scribbles). We also propose a weighted loss function considering network and interaction-based uncertainty for the fine-tuning. We applied this framework to two applications: 2D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal MR slices, where only two types of these organs were annotated for training; and 3D segmentation of brain tumor core (excluding edema) and whole brain tumor (including edema) from different MR sequences, where only tumor cores in one MR sequence were annotated for training. Experimental results show that 1) our model is more robust to segment previously unseen objects than state-of-the-art CNNs; 2) image-specific fine-tuning with the proposed weighted loss function significantly improves segmentation accuracy; and 3) our method leads to accurate results with fewer user interactions and less user time than traditional interactive segmentation methods.",0

"Digital image segmentation is the process of assigning distinct labels to different objects in a digital image, and the fuzzy segmentation algorithm has been successfully used in the segmentation of images from a wide variety of sources. However, the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm fails to segment objects that are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted area. In this paper, we propose an extension of the fuzzy segmentation algorithm that uses adaptive textural affinity functions to perform the segmentation of such objects on bidimensional images. The adaptive affinity functions compute their appropriate neighborhood size as they compute the texture descriptors surrounding the seed spels (spatial elements), according to the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments the image with an appropriate neighborhood for each object. We performed experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz database, and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the applicability of our method.",0

"Efficient and real time segmentation of color images has a variety of importance in many fields of computer vision such as image compression, medical imaging, mapping and autonomous navigation. Being one of the most computationally expensive operation, it is usually done through software imple- mentation using high-performance processors. In robotic systems, however, with the constrained platform dimensions and the need for portability, low power consumption and simultaneously the need for real time image segmentation, we envision hardware parallelism as the way forward to achieve higher acceleration.

"In this paper, we propose spatial propagation networks for learning the affinity matrix for vision tasks. We show that by constructing a row/column linear propagation model, the spatially varying transformation matrix exactly constitutes an affinity matrix that models dense, global pairwise relationships of an image. Specifically, we develop a three-way connection for the linear propagation model, which (a) formulates a sparse transformation matrix, where all elements can be the output from a deep CNN, but (b) results in a dense affinity matrix that effectively models any task-specific pairwise similarity matrix. Instead of designing the similarity kernels according to image features of two points, we can directly output all the similarities in a purely data-driven manner. The spatial propagation network is a generic framework that can be applied to many affinity-related tasks, including but not limited to image matting, segmentation and colorization, to name a few. Essentially, the model can learn semantically-aware affinity values for high-level vision tasks due to the powerful learning capability of the deep neural network classifier. We validate the framework on the task of refinement for image segmentation boundaries. Experiments on the HELEN face parsing and PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic segmentation tasks show that the spatial propagation network provides a general, effective and efficient solution for generating high-quality segmentation results.",0

"Marking tumors and organs is a challenging task suffering from both inter- and intra-observer variability. The literature quantifies observer variability by generating consensus among multiple experts when they mark the same image. Automatically building consensus contours to establish quality assurance for image segmentation is presently absent in the clinical practice. As the \emph{big data} becomes more and more available, techniques to access a large number of existing segments of multiple experts becomes possible. Fast algorithms are, hence, required to facilitate the search for similar cases. The present work puts forward a potential framework that tested with small datasets (both synthetic and real images) displays the reliability of finding similar images. In this paper, the idea of content-based barcodes is used to retrieve similar cases in order to build consensus contours in medical image segmentation. This approach may be regarded as an extension of the conventional atlas-based segmentation that generally works with rather small atlases due to required computational expenses. The fast segment-retrieval process via barcodes makes it possible to create and use large atlases, something that directly contributes to the quality of the consensus building. Because the accuracy of experts' contours must be measured, we first used 500 synthetic prostate images with their gold markers and delineations by 20 simulated users. The fast barcode-guided computed consensus delivered an average error of $8\%\!\pm\!5\%$ compared against the gold standard segments. Furthermore, we used magnetic resonance images of prostates from 15 patients delineated by 5 oncologists and selected the best delineations to serve as the gold-standard segments. The proposed barcode atlas achieved a Jaccard overlap of $87\%\!\pm\!9\%$ with the contours of the gold-standard segments.",0

"Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for diagnosis, surgical planning and many other applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art automatic segmentation methods. However, fully automatic results may still need to be refined to become accurate and robust enough for clinical use. We propose a deep learning-based interactive segmentation method to improve the results obtained by an automatic CNN and to reduce user interactions during refinement for higher accuracy. We use one CNN to obtain an initial automatic segmentation, on which user interactions are added to indicate mis-segmentations. Another CNN takes as input the user interactions with the initial segmentation and gives a refined result. We propose to combine user interactions with CNNs through geodesic distance transforms, and propose a resolution-preserving network that gives a better dense prediction. In addition, we integrate user interactions as hard constraints into a back-propagatable Conditional Random Field.

"Semantic image segmentation is an important computer vision task that is difficult because it consists of both recognition and segmentation. The task is often cast as a structured output problem on an exponentially large output-space, which is typically modeled by a discrete probabilistic model. The best segmentation is found by inferring the Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) solution over the output distribution defined by the model. Due to limitations in optimization, the model cannot be arbitrarily complex. This leads to a trade-off: devise a more accurate model that incorporates rich high-order interactions between image elements at the cost of inaccurate and possibly intractable optimization OR leverage a tractable model which produces less accurate MAP solutions but may contain high quality solutions as other modes of its output distribution.   This thesis investigates the latter and presents a two stage approach to semantic segmentation. In the first stage a tractable segmentation model outputs a set of high probability segmentations from the underlying distribution that are not just minor perturbations of each other. Critically the output of this stage is a diverse set of plausible solutions and not just a single one. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the segmentation model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than simply returning the MAP solution. The formulation is agnostic to the underlying segmentation model (e.g. CRF, CNN, etc.) and optimization algorithm, which makes it applicable to a wide range of models and inference methods. Evaluation of the approach on a number of semantic image segmentation benchmark datasets highlight its superiority over inferring the MAP solution.",0

Our DMT is a generic classification model that inherently embeds different cascades of classifiers while enhancing learning transfer between them to boost up their classification accuracies. Specifically, each node in our DMT can nest a Structured Random Forest (SRF) classifier or a Bayesian Network (BN) classifier. The proposed SRF-BN DMT architecture has several appealing properties. First, while SRF operates at a patch-level (regular image region), BN operates at the super-pixel level (irregular image region), thereby enabling the DMT to integrate multi-level image knowledge in the learning process. Second, although BN is powerful in modeling dependencies between image elements (superpixels, edges) and their features, the learning of its structure and parameters is challenging. On the other hand, SRF may fail to accurately detect very irregular object boundaries. The proposed DMT robustly overcomes these limitations for both classifiers through the ascending and descending flow of contextual information between each parent node and its children nodes. Third, we train DMT using different scales, where we progressively decrease the patch and superpixel sizes as we go deeper along the tree edges nearing its leaf nodes. Last, DMT demonstrates its outperformance in comparison to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods for multi-labeling of brain images with gliomas.",0
"Our team has developed a dynamic multiscale tree (DMT) architecture that improves the accuracy of multi-label image segmentation by incorporating various existing classifiers. Unlike previous approaches that simply combine or sequence classifiers, our solution embeds strong classifiers within a tree structure that permits information flow in both directions, enhancing their performance over time. The DMT is a versatile classification model that comprises a range of classifier cascades, each of which learns from the others to improve classification accuracy. Each node in the DMT can contain either a Structured Random Forest (SRF) classifier or a Bayesian Network (BN) classifier. Our proposed SRF-BN DMT architecture has several benefits, including the ability to integrate multi-level image knowledge in the learning process by operating at different patch and super-pixel levels. Additionally, the DMT overcomes the limitations of each classifier by exchanging contextual information between parent and child nodes. Finally, DMT outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods for multi-labeling of brain images with gliomas.",1
"Longitudinal reproducibility is an essential concern in automated medical image segmentation, yet has proven to be an elusive objective as manual brain structure tracings have shown more than 10% variability. To improve reproducibility, lon-gitudinal segmentation (4D) approaches have been investigated to reconcile tem-poral variations with traditional 3D approaches. In the past decade, multi-atlas la-bel fusion has become a state-of-the-art segmentation technique for 3D image and many efforts have been made to adapt it to a 4D longitudinal fashion. However, the previous methods were either limited by using application specified energy function (e.g., surface fusion and multi model fusion) or only considered tem-poral smoothness on two consecutive time points (t and t+1) under sparsity as-sumption. Therefore, a 4D multi-atlas label fusion theory for general label fusion purpose and simultaneously considering temporal consistency on all time points is appealing. Herein, we propose a novel longitudinal label fusion algorithm, called 4D joint label fusion (4DJLF), to incorporate the temporal consistency modeling via non-local patch-intensity covariance models. The advantages of 4DJLF include: (1) 4DJLF is under the general label fusion framework by simul-taneously incorporating the spatial and temporal covariance on all longitudinal time points. (2) The proposed algorithm is a longitudinal generalization of a lead-ing joint label fusion method (JLF) that has proven adaptable to a wide variety of applications. (3) The spatial temporal consistency of atlases is modeled in a prob-abilistic model inspired from both voting based and statistical fusion. The pro-posed approach improves the consistency of the longitudinal segmentation while retaining sensitivity compared with original JLF approach using the same set of atlases. The method is available online in open-source.",0
"Automated medical image segmentation requires longitudinal reproducibility, which has been difficult to achieve due to over 10% variability in manual brain structure tracings.

"In this paper, we cast the scribble-based interactive image segmentation as a semi-supervised learning problem. Our novel approach alleviates the need to solve an expensive generalized eigenvector problem by approximating the eigenvectors using efficiently computed eigenfunctions. The smoothness operator defined on feature densities at the limit n tends to infinity recovers the exact eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. To further reduce the computational complexity without scarifying our accuracy, we select pivots pixels from user annotations. In our experiments, we evaluate our approach using both human scribble and ""robot user"" annotations to guide the foreground/background segmentation. We developed a new unbiased collection of five annotated images datasets to standardize the evaluation procedure for any scribble-based segmentation method.

"In many computer vision tasks, we expect a particular behavior of the output with respect to rotations of the input image. If this relationship is explicitly encoded, instead of treated as any other variation, the complexity of the problem is decreased, leading to a reduction in the size of the required model. In this paper, we propose the Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Networks (RotEqNet), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture encoding rotation equivariance, invariance and covariance. Each convolutional filter is applied at multiple orientations and returns a vector field representing magnitude and angle of the highest scoring orientation at every spatial location. We develop a modified convolution operator relying on this representation to obtain deep architectures. We test RotEqNet on several problems requiring different responses with respect to the inputs' rotation: image classification, biomedical image segmentation, orientation estimation and patch matching. In all cases, we show that RotEqNet offers extremely compact models in terms of number of parameters and provides results in line to those of networks orders of magnitude larger.",0

"One of the most straightforward, direct and efficient approaches to Image Segmentation is Image Thresholding. Multi-level Image Thresholding is an essential viewpoint in many image processing and Pattern Recognition based real-time applications which can effectively and efficiently classify the pixels into various groups denoting multiple regions in an Image. Thresholding based Image Segmentation using fuzzy entropy combined with intelligent optimization approaches are commonly used direct methods to properly identify the thresholds so that they can be used to segment an Image accurately. In this paper a novel approach for multi-level image thresholding is proposed using Type II Fuzzy sets combined with Adaptive Plant Propagation Algorithm (APPA). Obtaining the optimal thresholds for an image by maximizing the entropy is extremely tedious and time consuming with increase in the number of thresholds. Hence, Adaptive Plant Propagation Algorithm (APPA), a memetic algorithm based on plant intelligence, is used for fast and efficient selection of optimal thresholds. This fact is reasonably justified by comparing the accuracy of the outcomes and computational time consumed by other modern state-of-the-art algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).",0

"Inspired by the combination of feedforward and iterative computations in the virtual cortex, and taking advantage of the ability of denoising autoencoders to estimate the score of a joint distribution, we propose a novel approach to iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution of output variables conditioned on some input variables. This approach is applied to image pixel-wise segmentation, with the estimated conditional score used to perform gradient ascent towards a mode of the estimated conditional distribution. This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique. We experimentally find that the proposed iterative inference from conditional score estimation by conditional denoising autoencoders performs better than comparable models based on CRFs or those not using any explicit modeling of the conditional joint distribution of outputs.",0

"Learning rich and diverse representations is critical for the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we consider how to use privileged information to promote inherent diversity of a single CNN model such that the model can learn better representations and offer stronger generalization ability. To this end, we propose a novel group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) that learns untangled representations within each layer by exploiting provided privileged information and enhances representation diversity effectively. We take image classification as an example where image segmentation annotations are used as privileged information during the training process. Experiments on two benchmark datasets -- ImageNet and PASCAL VOC -- clearly demonstrate the strong generalization ability of our proposed GoCNN model. On the ImageNet dataset, GoCNN improves the performance of state-of-the-art ResNet-152 model by absolute value of 1.2% while only uses privileged information of 10% of the training images, confirming effectiveness of GoCNN on utilizing available privileged knowledge to train better CNNs.",0

"Slack and margin rescaling are variants of the structured output SVM, which is frequently applied to problems in computer vision such as image segmentation, object localization, and learning parts based object models. They define convex surrogates to task specific loss functions, which, when specialized to non-additive loss functions for multi-label problems, yield extensions to increasing set functions. We demonstrate in this paper that we may use these concepts to define polynomial time convex extensions of arbitrary supermodular functions, providing an analysis framework for the tightness of these surrogates. This analysis framework shows that, while neither margin nor slack rescaling dominate the other, known bounds on supermodular functions can be used to derive extensions that dominate both of these, indicating possible directions for defining novel structured output prediction surrogates. In addition to the analysis of structured prediction loss functions, these results imply an approach to supermodular minimization in which margin rescaling is combined with non-polynomial time convex extensions to compute a sequence of LP relaxations reminiscent of a cutting plane method. This approach is applied to the problem of selecting representative exemplars from a set of images, validating our theoretical contributions.",0

"Color image segmentation is a very emerging research topic in the area of color image analysis and pattern recognition. Many state-of-the-art algorithms have been developed for this purpose. But, often the segmentation results of these algorithms seem to be suffering from miss-classifications and over-segmentation. The reasons behind these are the degradation of image quality during the acquisition, transmission and color space conversion. So, here arises the need of an efficient image enhancement technique which can remove the redundant pixels or noises from the color image before proceeding for final segmentation. In this paper, an effort has been made to study and analyze different image enhancement techniques and thereby finding out the better one for color image segmentation. Also, this comparative study is done on two well-known color spaces HSV and LAB separately to find out which color space supports segmentation task more efficiently with respect to those enhancement techniques.",0

"We approach structured output prediction by optimizing a deep value network (DVN) to precisely estimate the task loss on different output configurations for a given input. Once the model is trained, we perform inference by gradient descent on the continuous relaxations of the output variables to find outputs with promising scores from the value network. When applied to image segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar estimating the intersection over union between the input and ground truth masks.

"Selective weeding is one of the key challenges in the field of agriculture robotics. To accomplish this task, a farm robot should be able to accurately detect plants and to distinguish them between crop and weeds. Most of the promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming task, actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e., crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation architecture. We compare the classification results obtained using both real and synthetic images as training data. The reported results confirm the effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.",0

"In this paper we are interested in the problem of image segmentation given natural language descriptions, i.e. referring expressions. Existing works tackle this problem by first modeling images and sentences independently and then segment images by combining these two types of representations. We argue that learning word-to-image interaction is more native in the sense of jointly modeling two modalities for the image segmentation task, and we propose convolutional multimodal LSTM to encode the sequential interactions between individual words, visual information, and spatial information. We show that our proposed model outperforms the baseline model on benchmark datasets.

"This manuscript introduces the problem of prominent object detection and recognition inspired by the fact that human seems to priorities perception of scene elements. The problem deals with finding the most important region of interest, segmenting the relevant item/object in that area, and assigning it an object class label. In other words, we are solving the three problems of saliency modeling, saliency detection, and object recognition under one umbrella.

We are foreseeing extending this problem formulation to fully semantically segmented scenes with instance object priority for high-level inferences in various applications including assistive vision. Along with a new problem definition, we also propose a method to achieve such a task. The proposed model predicts the most important area in the image, segments the associated objects, and labels them. The proposed problem and method are evaluated against human fixations, annotated segmentation masks, and object class categories. We define a chance level for each of the evaluation criterion to compare the proposed algorithm with.

"Non-invasive detection of cardiovascular disorders from radiology scans requires quantitative image analysis of the heart and its substructures. There are well-established measurements that radiologists use for diseases assessment such as ejection fraction, volume of four chambers, and myocardium mass. These measurements are derived as outcomes of precise segmentation of the heart and its substructures. The aim of this paper is to provide such measurements through an accurate image segmentation algorithm that automatically delineates seven substructures of the heart from MRI and/or CT scans. Our proposed method is based on multi-planar deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an adaptive fusion strategy where we automatically utilize complementary information from different planes of the 3D scans for improved delineations.

"While deep learning is remarkably successful on perceptual tasks, it was also shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of the input. These perturbations denote noise added to the input that was generated specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible for humans. More severely, there even exist universal perturbations that are input-agnostic but fool the network on the majority of inputs. While recent work has focused on image classification, this work proposes attacks against semantic image segmentation: we present an approach for generating (universal) adversarial perturbations that make the network yield a desired target segmentation as output. We show empirically that there exist barely perceptible universal noise patterns which result in nearly the same predicted segmentation for arbitrary inputs. Furthermore, we also show the existence of universal noise which removes a target class (e.g., all pedestrians) from the segmentation while leaving the segmentation mostly unchanged otherwise.",0
"Although deep learning is highly effective in tasks related to perception, it can be easily deceived by adversarial alterations made to the input. These changes refer to adding noise to the input, which is created to trick the system while being almost undetectable to humans. In some cases, universal perturbations can deceive the network on most inputs, regardless of their type. While previous research has mainly concentrated on image classification, this study proposes a method for attacking semantic image segmentation. We introduce a technique for generating (universal) adversarial perturbations that prompt the network to produce a target segmentation as the output. We demonstrate through experiments that there are universal noise patterns that are hardly noticeable but lead to almost identical predicted segmentation for any input. Additionally, we exhibit the existence of universal noise that eliminates a particular class (such as all pedestrians) from the segmentation, leaving the segmentation mostly unchanged in other respects.",1

"Rapid growth in the field of quantitative digital image analysis is paving the way for researchers to make precise measurements about objects in an image. To compute quantities from the image such as the density of compressed materials or the velocity of a shockwave, we must determine object boundaries. Images containing regions that each have a spatial trend in intensity are of particular interest. We present a supervised image segmentation method that incorporates spatial information to locate boundaries between regions with overlapping intensity histograms. The segmentation of a pixel is determined by comparing its intensity to distributions from local, nearby pixel intensities. Because of the statistical nature of the algorithm, we use maximum likelihood estimation theory to quantify uncertainty about each boundary. We demonstrate the success of this algorithm on a radiograph of a multicomponent cylinder and on an optical image of a laser-induced shockwave, and we provide final boundary locations with associated bands of uncertainty.",0

"This paper presents GridNet, a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for semantic image segmentation (full scene labelling). Classical neural networks are implemented as one stream from the input to the output with subsampling operators applied in the stream in order to reduce the feature maps size and to increase the receptive field for the final prediction. However, for semantic image segmentation, where the task consists in providing a semantic class to each pixel of an image, feature maps reduction is harmful because it leads to a resolution loss in the output prediction. To tackle this problem, our GridNet follows a grid pattern allowing multiple interconnected streams to work at different resolutions. We show that our network generalizes many well known networks such as conv-deconv, residual or U-Net networks. GridNet is trained from scratch and achieves competitive results on the Cityscapes dataset.",0

"Deep learning usually requires large amounts of labeled training data, but annotating data is costly and tedious.

"Delineation of line patterns in images is a basic step required in various applications such as blood vessel detection in medical images, segmentation of rivers or roads in aerial images, detection of cracks in walls or pavements, etc. In this paper we present trainable B-COSFIRE filters, which are a model of some neurons in area V1 of the primary visual cortex, and apply it to the delineation of line patterns in different kinds of images. B-COSFIRE filters are trainable as their selectivity is determined in an automatic configuration process given a prototype pattern of interest. They are configurable to detect any preferred line structure (e.g. segments, corners, cross-overs, etc.), so usable for automatic data representation learning. We carried out experiments on two data sets, namely a line-network data set from INRIA and a data set of retinal fundus images named IOSTAR.

"There is a vast body of theoretical research on lifted inference in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). However, few demonstrations exist where lifting is applied in conjunction with top of the line applied algorithms. We pursue the applicability of lifted inference for computer vision (CV), with the insight that a globally optimal (MAP) labeling will likely have the same label for two symmetric pixels. The success of our approach lies in efficiently handling a distinct unary potential on every node (pixel), typical of CV applications. This allows us to lift the large class of algorithms that model a CV problem via PGM inference. We propose a generic template for coarse-to-fine (C2F) inference in CV, which progressively refines an initial coarsely lifted PGM for varying quality-time trade-offs. We demonstrate the performance of C2F inference by developing lifted versions of two near state-of-the-art CV algorithms for stereo vision and interactive image segmentation.

"This study deals with semantic segmentation of high-resolution (aerial) images where a semantic class label is assigned to each pixel via supervised classification as a basis for automatic map generation. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and have quickly become the de-facto standard for semantic segmentation, with the added benefit that task-specific feature design is no longer necessary. However, a major downside of deep learning methods is that they are extremely data-hungry, thus aggravating the perennial bottleneck of supervised classification, to obtain enough annotated training data. On the other hand, it has been observed that they are rather robust against noise in the training labels. This opens up the intriguing possibility to avoid annotating huge amounts of training data, and instead train the classifier from existing legacy data or crowd-sourced maps which can exhibit high levels of noise. The question addressed in this paper is: can training with large-scale, publicly available labels replace a substantial part of the manual labeling effort and still achieve sufficient performance? Such data will inevitably contain a significant portion of errors, but in return virtually unlimited quantities of it are available in larger parts of the world. We adapt a state-of-the-art CNN architecture for semantic segmentation of buildings and roads in aerial images, and compare its performance when using different training data sets, ranging from manually labeled, pixel-accurate ground truth of the same city to automatic training data derived from OpenStreetMap data from distant locations. We report our results that indicate that satisfying performance can be obtained with significantly less manual annotation effort, by exploiting noisy large-scale training data.",0

"Calcium imaging is a technique for observing neuron activity as a series of images showing indicator fluorescence over time. Manually segmenting neurons is time-consuming, leading to research on automated calcium imaging segmentation (ACIS).

"Inspired by classic generative adversarial networks (GAN), we propose a novel end-to-end adversarial neural network, called SegAN, for the task of medical image segmentation. Since image segmentation requires dense, pixel-level labeling, the single scalar real/fake output of a classic GAN's discriminator may be ineffective in producing stable and sufficient gradient feedback to the networks. Instead, we use a fully convolutional neural network as the segmentor to generate segmentation label maps, and propose a novel adversarial critic network with a multi-scale $L_1$ loss function to force the critic and segmentor to learn both global and local features that capture long- and short-range spatial relationships between pixels. In our SegAN framework, the segmentor and critic networks are trained in an alternating fashion in a min-max game: The critic takes as input a pair of images, (original_image $*$ predicted_label_map, original_image $*$ ground_truth_label_map), and then is trained by maximizing a multi-scale loss function; The segmentor is trained with only gradients passed along by the critic, with the aim to minimize the multi-scale loss function. We show that such a SegAN framework is more effective and stable for the segmentation task, and it leads to better performance than the state-of-the-art U-net segmentation method. We tested our SegAN method using datasets from the MICCAI BRATS brain tumor segmentation challenge. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SegAN with multi-scale loss: on BRATS 2013 SegAN gives performance comparable to the state-of-the-art for whole tumor and tumor core segmentation while achieves better precision and sensitivity for Gd-enhance tumor core segmentation; on BRATS 2015 SegAN achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art in both dice score and precision.",0

"Image segmentation has come a long way since the early days of computer vision, and still remains a challenging task. Modern variations of the classical (purely bottom-up) approach, involve, e.g., some form of user assistance (interactive segmentation) or ask for the simultaneous segmentation of two or more images (co-segmentation). At an abstract level, all these variants can be thought of as ""constrained"" versions of the original formulation, whereby the segmentation process is guided by some external source of information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle this kind of problems in a unified way. Our work is based on some properties of a family of quadratic optimization problems related to dominant sets, a well-known graph-theoretic notion of a cluster which generalizes the concept of a maximal clique to edge-weighted graphs. In particular, we show that by properly controlling a regularization parameter which determines the structure and the scale of the underlying problem, we are in a position to extract groups of dominant-set clusters that are constrained to contain predefined elements. In particular, we shall focus on interactive segmentation and co-segmentation (in both the unsupervised and the interactive versions). The proposed algorithm can deal naturally with several type of constraints and input modality, including scribbles, sloppy contours, and bounding boxes, and is able to robustly handle noisy annotations on the part of the user.

"Fully convolutional deep neural networks carry out excellent potential for fast and accurate image segmentation. One of the main challenges in training these networks is data imbalance, which is particularly problematic in medical imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where the number of lesion voxels is often much lower than the number of non-lesion voxels. Training with unbalanced data can lead to predictions that are severely biased towards high precision but low recall (sensitivity), which is undesired especially in medical applications where false negatives are much less tolerable than false positives. Several methods have been proposed to deal with this problem including balanced sampling, two step training, sample re-weighting, and similarity loss functions. In this paper, we propose a generalized loss function based on the Tversky index to address the issue of data imbalance and achieve much better trade-off between precision and recall in training 3D fully convolutional deep neural networks. Experimental results in multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation on magnetic resonance images show improved F2 score, Dice coefficient, and the area under the precision-recall curve in test data. Based on these results we suggest Tversky loss function as a generalized framework to effectively train deep neural networks.",0

"Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in biomedical image analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising results on many biomedical image segmentation benchmarks. However, due to large variations in biomedical images (different modalities, image settings, objects, noise, etc), to utilize deep learning on a new application, it usually needs a new set of training data. This can incur a great deal of annotation effort and cost, because only biomedical experts can annotate effectively, and often there are too many instances in images (e.g., cells) to annotate. In this paper, we aim to address the following question: With limited effort (e.g., time) for annotation, what instances should be annotated in order to attain the best performance? We present a deep active learning framework that combines fully convolutional network (FCN) and active learning to significantly reduce annotation effort by making judicious suggestions on the most effective annotation areas. We utilize uncertainty and similarity information provided by FCN and formulate a generalized version of the maximum set cover problem to determine the most representative and uncertain areas for annotation. Extensive experiments using the 2015 MICCAI Gland Challenge dataset and a lymph node ultrasound image segmentation dataset show that, using annotation suggestions by our method, state-of-the-art segmentation performance can be achieved by using only 50% of training data.",0

"Background: Cardiac MRI derived biventricular mass and function parameters, such as end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), and ventricular mass (VM) are clinically well established. Image segmentation can be challenging and time-consuming, due to the complex anatomy of the human heart.   Objectives: This study introduces $\nu$-net (/nju:n$\varepsilon$t/) -- a deep learning approach allowing for fully-automated high quality segmentation of right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium for extraction of cardiac function parameters.   Methods: A set consisting of 253 manually segmented cases has been used to train a deep neural network. Subsequently, the network has been evaluated on 4 different multicenter data sets with a total of over 1000 cases.   Results: For LV EF the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is 98, 95, and 80 % (95 %), and for RV EF 96, and 87 % (80 %) on the respective data sets (human expert ICCs reported in parenthesis). The LV VM ICC is 95, and 94 % (84 %), and the RV VM ICC is 83, and 83 % (54 %). This study proposes a simple adjustment procedure, allowing for the adaptation to distinct segmentation philosophies. $\nu$-net exhibits state of-the-art performance in terms of dice coefficient.   Conclusions: Biventricular mass and function parameters can be determined reliably in high quality by applying a deep neural network for cardiac MRI segmentation, especially in the anatomically complex right ventricle.

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative condition of the nervous system, which manifests itself primarily as muscle stiffness, hypokinesia, bradykinesia, and tremor. In patients suffering from advanced stages of PD, Deep Brain Stimulation neurosurgery (DBS) is the best alternative to medical treatment, especially when they become tolerant to the drugs. This surgery produces a neuronal activity, a result from electrical stimulation, whose quantification is known as Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA). To locate correctly the VTA in the cerebral volume space, one should be aware exactly the location of the tip of the DBS electrodes, as well as their spatial projection.   In this paper, we automatically locate DBS electrodes using a threshold-based medical imaging segmentation methodology, determining the optimal value of this threshold adaptively. The proposed methodology allows the localization of DBS electrodes in Computed Tomography (CT) images, with high noise tolerance, using automatic threshold detection methods.",0

"Purpose: To improve kidney segmentation in clinical ultrasound (US) images, we develop a new graph cuts based method to segment kidney US images by integrating original image intensity information and texture feature maps extracted using Gabor filters. Methods: To handle large appearance variation within kidney images and improve computational efficiency, we build a graph of image pixels close to kidney boundary instead of building a graph of the whole image. To make the kidney segmentation robust to weak boundaries, we adopt localized regional information to measure similarity between image pixels for computing edge weights to build the graph of image pixels. The localized graph is dynamically updated and the GC based segmentation iteratively progresses until convergence. The proposed method has been evaluated and compared with state of the art image segmentation methods based on clinical kidney US images of 85 subjects. We randomly selected US images of 20 subjects as training data for tuning the parameters, and validated the methods based on US images of the remaining 65 subjects. The segmentation results have been quantitatively analyzed using 3 metrics, including Dice Index, Jaccard Index, and Mean Distance. Results: Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed method obtained segmentation results for bilateral kidneys of 65 subjects with average Dice index of 0.9581, Jaccard index of 0.9204, and Mean Distance of 1.7166, better than other methods under comparison (p<10-19, paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests). Conclusions: The proposed method achieved promising performance for segmenting kidneys in US images, better than segmentation methods that built on any single channel of image information.

"The key idea of current deep learning methods for dense prediction is to apply a model on a regular patch centered on each pixel to make pixel-wise predictions. These methods are limited in the sense that the patches are determined by network architecture instead of learned from data. In this work, we propose the dense transformer networks, which can learn the shapes and sizes of patches from data. The dense transformer networks employ an encoder-decoder architecture, and a pair of dense transformer modules are inserted into each of the encoder and decoder paths. The novelty of this work is that we provide technical solutions for learning the shapes and sizes of patches from data and efficiently restoring the spatial correspondence required for dense prediction.

"A major challenge in brain tumor treatment planning and quantitative evaluation is determination of the tumor extent.

"Imaging the atmosphere using ground-based sky cameras is a popular approach to study various atmospheric phenomena. However, it usually focuses on the daytime. Nighttime sky/cloud images are darker and noisier, and thus harder to analyze. An accurate segmentation of sky/cloud images is already challenging because of the clouds' non-rigid structure and size, and the lower and less stable illumination of the night sky increases the difficulty. Nonetheless, nighttime cloud imaging is essential in certain applications, such as continuous weather analysis and satellite communication.   In this paper, we propose a superpixel-based method to segment nighttime sky/cloud images. We also release the first nighttime sky/cloud image segmentation database to the research community.

"Shape priors have been widely utilized in medical image segmentation to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness. A major way to encode such a prior shape model is to use a mesh representation, which is prone to causing self-intersection or mesh folding. Those problems require complex and expensive algorithms to mitigate. In this paper, we propose a novel shape prior directly embedded in the voxel grid space, based on gradient vector flows of a pre-segmentation. The flexible and powerful prior shape representation is ready to be extended to simultaneously segmenting multiple interacting objects with minimum separation distance constraint. The problem is formulated as a Markov random field problem whose exact solution can be efficiently computed with a single minimum s-t cut in an appropriately constructed graph. The proposed algorithm is validated on two multi-object segmentation applications: the brain tissue segmentation in MRI images, and the bladder/prostate segmentation in CT images.

"Anatomical and biophysical modeling of left atrium (LA) and proximal pulmonary veins (PPVs) is important for clinical management of several cardiac diseases.

"In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed ""DeepLab"" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

"Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling layers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to predictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has attempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or MRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between objects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these problems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The downside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than traditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.   In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk Network (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and spatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity. Our proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and semantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk layer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the network. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix multiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks and it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard back-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional parameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces an improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",0

"State-of-the-art semantic image segmentation methods are mostly based on training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we proffer to improve semantic segmentation with the use of contextual information. In particular, we explore `patch-patch' context and `patch-background' context in deep CNNs. We formulate deep structured models by combining CNNs and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for learning the patch-patch context between image regions. Specifically, we formulate CNN-based pairwise potential functions to capture semantic correlations between neighboring patches. Efficient piecewise training of the proposed deep structured model is then applied in order to avoid repeated expensive CRF inference during the course of back propagation.

"Color and intensity are two important components in an image. Usually, groups of image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative representation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for computer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal generation. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may be quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this paper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image segmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which is robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a Cohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the formulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel object discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by utilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed method to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental results on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based method has achieved promising performance for these two tasks.",0

"The healthcare industry is unique and holds a high level of importance to society, with people expecting top-notch care and services regardless of cost. Despite consuming a large portion of the budget, it has not met social expectations. Medical data interpretation is mainly conducted by experts, but image interpretation by human experts is limited due to subjectivity, image complexity, variations among interpreters, and fatigue. However, deep learning has proven successful in other areas and is now providing accurate solutions for medical imaging, making it a crucial method for future healthcare applications. This chapter explores the state of the art deep learning architecture and optimization techniques used for medical image segmentation and classification, as well as the challenges and open research issues surrounding deep learning-based methods for medical imaging.",1
"Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) trained on a large number of images with strong pixel-level annotations have become the new state of the art for the semantic segmentation task. While there have been recent attempts to learn FCNNs from image-level weak annotations, they need additional constraints, such as the size of an object, to obtain reasonable performance. To address this issue, we present motion-CNN (M-CNN), a novel FCNN framework which incorporates motion cues and is learned from video-level weak annotations. Our learning scheme to train the network uses motion segments as soft constraints, thereby handling noisy motion information. When trained on weakly-annotated videos, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art EM-Adapt approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark. We also demonstrate that the performance of M-CNN learned with 150 weak video annotations is on par with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods trained with thousands of images. Finally, M-CNN substantially outperforms recent approaches in a related task of video co-localization on the YouTube-Objects dataset.",0

"In application domains such as robotics, it is useful to represent the uncertainty related to the robot's belief about the state of its environment. Algorithms that only yield a single ""best guess"" as a result are not sufficient. In this paper, we propose object proposal generation based on non-parametric Bayesian inference that allows quantification of the likelihood of the proposals. We apply Markov chain Monte Carlo to draw samples of image segmentations via the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on an indoor object discovery data set, while additionally providing a likelihood term for each proposal. We show that the likelihood term can effectively be used to rank proposals according to their quality.",0

"Automatic segmentation of medical images is an important task for many clinical applications. In practice, a wide range of anatomical structures are visualised using different imaging modalities. In this paper, we investigate whether a single convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained to perform different segmentation tasks.   A single CNN is trained to segment six tissues in MR brain images, the pectoral muscle in MR breast images, and the coronary arteries in cardiac CTA. The CNN therefore learns to identify the imaging modality, the visualised anatomical structures, and the tissue classes.   For each of the three tasks (brain MRI, breast MRI and cardiac CTA), this combined training procedure resulted in a segmentation performance equivalent to that of a CNN trained specifically for that task, demonstrating the high capacity of CNN architectures. Hence, a single system could be used in clinical practice to automatically perform diverse segmentation tasks without task-specific training.",0

"We introduce a novel loss max-pooling concept for handling imbalanced training data distributions, applicable as alternative loss layer in the context of deep neural networks for semantic image segmentation. Most real-world semantic segmentation datasets exhibit long tail distributions with few object categories comprising the majority of data and consequently biasing the classifiers towards them. Our method adaptively re-weights the contributions of each pixel based on their observed losses, targeting under-performing classification results as often encountered for under-represented object classes. Our approach goes beyond conventional cost-sensitive learning attempts through adaptive considerations that allow us to indirectly address both, inter- and intra-class imbalances. We provide a theoretical justification of our approach, complementary to experimental analyses on benchmark datasets. In our experiments on the Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation datasets we find consistently improved results, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.",0

"Automatic cell image segmentation methods in connectomics produce merge and split errors, which require correction through proofreading. Previous research has identified the visual search for these errors as the bottleneck in interactive proofreading. To aid error correction, we develop two classifiers that automatically recommend candidate merges and splits to the user. These classifiers use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained with errors in automatic segmentations against expert-labeled ground truth. Our classifiers detect potentially-erroneous regions by considering a large context region around a segmentation boundary. Corrections can then be performed by a user with yes/no decisions, which reduces variation of information 7.5x faster than previous proofreading methods. We also present a fully-automatic mode that uses a probability threshold to make merge/split decisions. Extensive experiments using the automatic approach and comparing performance of novice and expert users demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art proofreading methods on different connectomics datasets.",0

"Tissue segmentation is an important pre-requisite for efficient and accurate diagnostics in digital pathology. However, it is well known that whole-slide scanners can fail in detecting all tissue regions, for example due to the tissue type, or due to weak staining because their tissue detection algorithms are not robust enough. In this paper, we introduce two different convolutional neural network architectures for whole slide image segmentation to accurately identify the tissue sections. We also compare the algorithms to a published traditional method. We collected 54 whole slide images with differing stains and tissue types from three laboratories to validate our algorithms.

"Reconstruction based on the stereo camera has received considerable attention recently, but two particular challenges still remain. The first concerns the need to aggregate similar pixels in an effective approach, and the second is to maintain as much of the available information as possible while ensuring sufficient accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose a new 3D representation method, namely, planecell, that extracts planarity from the depth-assisted image segmentation and then projects these depth planes into the 3D world. An energy function formulated from Conditional Random Field that generalizes the planar relationships is maximized to merge coplanar segments. We evaluate our method with a variety of reconstruction baselines on both KITTI and Middlebury datasets, and the results indicate the superiorities compared to other 3D space representation methods in accuracy, memory requirements and further applications.",0

"The task of counting eucalyptus trees from aerial images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been frequently explored by techniques of estimation of the basal area, i.e, by determining the expected number of trees based on sampling techniques. An alternative is the use of machine learning to identify patterns that represent a tree unit, and then search for the occurrence of these patterns throughout the image. This strategy depends on a supervised image segmentation step to define predefined interest regions. Thus, it is possible to automate the counting of eucalyptus trees in these images, thereby increasing the efficiency of the eucalyptus forest inventory management. In this paper, we evaluated 20 different classifiers for the image segmentation task. A real sample was used to analyze the counting trees task considering a practical environment.

"We propose a new approach to image segmentation, which exploits the advantages of both conditional random fields (CRFs) and decision trees. In the literature, the potential functions of CRFs are mostly defined as a linear combination of some pre-defined parametric models, and then methods like structured support vector machines (SSVMs) are applied to learn those linear coefficients. We instead formulate the unary and pairwise potentials as nonparametric forests---ensembles of decision trees, and learn the ensemble parameters and the trees in a unified optimization problem within the large-margin framework. In this fashion, we easily achieve nonlinear learning of potential functions on both unary and pairwise terms in CRFs. Moreover, we learn class-wise decision trees for each object that appears in the image. Due to the rich structure and flexibility of decision trees, our approach is powerful in modelling complex data likelihoods and label relationships. The resulting optimization problem is very challenging because it can have exponentially many variables and constraints. We show that this challenging optimization can be efficiently solved by combining a modified column generation and cutting-planes techniques. Experimental results on both binary (Graz-02, Weizmann horse, Oxford flower) and multi-class (MSRC-21, PASCAL VOC 2012) segmentation datasets demonstrate the power of the learned nonlinear nonparametric potentials.",0

"Paleness or pallor is a manifestation of blood loss or low hemoglobin concentrations in the human blood that can be caused by pathologies such as anemia. This work presents the first automated screening system that utilizes pallor site images, segments, and extracts color and intensity-based features for multi-class classification of patients with high pallor due to anemia-like pathologies, normal patients and patients with other abnormalities.

"Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into a set of meaningful regions according to some criteria.

"The state-of-the-art method for automatically segmenting white matter bundles in diffusion-weighted MRI is tractography in conjunction with streamline cluster selection.

"This paper proposes a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in dense Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

"This abstract briefly describes a segmentation algorithm developed for the ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Detection Competition hosted at [ref]. The objective of the competition is to perform a segmentation (in the form of a binary mask image) of skin lesions in dermoscopic images as close as possible to a segmentation performed by trained clinicians, which is taken as ground truth. This project only takes part in the segmentation phase of the challenge. The other phases of the competition (feature extraction and lesion identification) are not considered.   The proposed algorithm consists of 4 steps: (1) lesion image preprocessing, (2) image segmentation using k-means clustering of pixel colors, (3) calculation of a set of features describing the properties of each segmented region, and (4) calculation of a final score for each region, representing the likelihood of corresponding to a suitable lesion segmentation. The scores in step (4) are obtained by averaging the results of 2 different regression models using the scores of each region as input. Before using the algorithm these regression models must be trained using the training set of images and ground truth masks provided by the Competition. Steps 2 to 4 are repeated with an increasing number of clusters (and therefore the image is segmented into more regions) until there is no further improvement of the calculated scores.",0

"Mandible bone segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans is challenging due to mandible's structural irregularities, complex shape patterns, and lack of contrast in joints. Furthermore, connections of teeth to mandible and mandible to remaining parts of the skull make it extremely difficult to identify mandible boundary automatically. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel framework where we define the segmentation as two complementary tasks: recognition and delineation. For recognition, we use random forest regression to localize mandible in 3D. For delineation, we propose to use 3D gradient-based fuzzy connectedness (FC) image segmentation algorithm, operating on the recognized mandible sub-volume. Despite heavy CT artifacts and dental fillings, consisting half of the CT image data in our experiments, we have achieved highly accurate detection and delineation results. Specifically, detection accuracy more than 96% (measured by union of intersection (UoI)), the delineation accuracy of 91% (measured by dice similarity coefficient), and less than 1 mm in shape mismatch (Hausdorff Distance) were found.",0

"This paper introduces Progressively Diffused Networks (PDNs) for unifying multi-scale context modeling with deep feature learning, by taking semantic image segmentation as an exemplar application. Prior neural networks, such as ResNet, tend to enhance representational power by increasing the depth of architectures and driving the training objective across layers. However, we argue that spatial dependencies in different layers, which generally represent the rich contexts among data elements, are also critical to building deep and discriminative representations. To this end, our PDNs enables to progressively broadcast information over the learned feature maps by inserting a stack of information diffusion layers, each of which exploits multi-dimensional convolutional LSTMs (Long-Short-Term Memory Structures). In each LSTM unit, a special type of atrous filters are designed to capture the short range and long range dependencies from various neighbors to a certain site of the feature map and pass the accumulated information to the next layer. From the extensive experiments on semantic image segmentation benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet Parsing, PASCAL VOC2012 and PASCAL-Part), our framework demonstrates the effectiveness to substantially improve the performances over the popular existing neural network models, and achieves state-of-the-art on ImageNet Parsing for large scale semantic segmentation.",0

"Cell nuclei segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the analysis of biomedical images. With ever-growing sizes and amounts of three-dimensional images to be processed, there is a need for better and faster segmentation methods. Graph-based image segmentation has seen a rise in popularity in recent years, but is seen as very costly with regard to computational demand. We propose a new segmentation algorithm which overcomes these limitations. Our method uses recursive balanced graph partitioning to segment foreground components of a fast and efficient binarization.

"In this paper, we introduce a simple, yet powerful pipeline for medical image segmentation that combines Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks (FC-ResNets). We propose and examine a design that takes particular advantage of recent advances in the understanding of both Convolutional Neural Networks as well as ResNets. Our approach focuses upon the importance of a trainable pre-processing when using FC-ResNets and we show that a low-capacity FCN model can serve as a pre-processor to normalize medical input data. In our image segmentation pipeline, we use FCNs to obtain normalized images, which are then iteratively refined by means of a FC-ResNet to generate a segmentation prediction. As in other fully convolutional approaches, our pipeline can be used off-the-shelf on different image modalities. We show that using this pipeline, we exhibit state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Electron Microscopy benchmark, when compared to other 2D methods. We improve segmentation results on CT images of liver lesions, when contrasting with standard FCN methods. Moreover, when applying our 2D pipeline on a challenging 3D MRI prostate segmentation challenge we reach results that are competitive even when compared to 3D methods. The obtained results illustrate the strong potential and versatility of the pipeline by achieving highly accurate results on multi-modality images from different anatomical regions and organs.",0

"Several supermodular losses have been shown to improve the perceptual quality of image segmentation in a discriminative framework such as a structured output support vector machine (SVM). These loss functions do not necessarily have the same structure as the one used by the segmentation inference algorithm, and in general, we may have to resort to generic submodular minimization algorithms for loss augmented inference. Although these come with polynomial time guarantees, they are not practical to apply to image scale data. Many supermodular losses come with strong optimization guarantees, but are not readily incorporated in a loss augmented graph cuts procedure. This motivates our strategy of employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) decomposition for loss augmented inference. In doing so, we create a new API for the structured SVM that separates the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of the model from the loss augmentation during training. In this way, we gain computational efficiency, making new choices of loss functions practical for the first time, while simultaneously making the inference algorithm employed during training closer to the test time procedure. We show improvement both in accuracy and computational performance on the Microsoft Research Grabcut database and a brain structure segmentation task, empirically validating the use of several supermodular loss functions during training, and the improved computational properties of the proposed ADMM approach over the Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm point algorithm.",0

"We propose a method for semi-supervised training of structured-output neural networks. Inspired by the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we train a discriminator network to capture the notion of a quality of network output. To this end, we leverage the qualitative difference between outputs obtained on the labelled training data and unannotated data. We then use the discriminator as a source of error signal for unlabelled data. This effectively boosts the performance of a network on a held out test set. Initial experiments in image segmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework enables achieving the same network performance as in a fully supervised scenario, while using two times less annotations.",0

"Semantic image segmentation is a fundamental task in image understanding. Per-pixel semantic labelling of an image benefits greatly from the ability to consider region consistency both locally and globally. However, many Fully Convolutional Network based methods do not impose such consistency, which may give rise to noisy and implausible predictions. We address this issue by proposing a dense multi-label network module that is able to encourage the region consistency at different levels. This simple but effective module can be easily integrated into any semantic segmentation systems. With comprehensive experiments, we show that the dense multi-label can successfully remove the implausible labels and clear the confusion so as to boost the performance of semantic segmentation systems.",0

To combat this issue, we propose a dense multi-label network module that promotes region consistency across multiple levels.

"Edge detection is a classic problem in the field of image processing, which lays foundations for other tasks such as image segmentation. Conventionally, this operation is performed using gradient operators such as the Roberts or Sobel operator, which can discover local changes in intensity levels. These operators, however, perform poorly on low contrast images. In this paper, we propose an edge detector architecture for color images based on fuzzy theory and the Sobel operator. First, the R, G and B channels are extracted from an image and enhanced using fuzzy methods, in order to suppress noise and improve the contrast between the background and the objects. The Sobel operator is then applied to each of the channels, which are finally combined into an edge map of the origin image. Experimental results obtained through an FPGA-based implementation have proved the proposed method effective.",0

"Topic models (e.g., pLSA, LDA, sLDA) have been widely used for segmenting imagery. However, these models are confined to crisp segmentation, forcing a visual word (i.e., an image patch) to belong to one and only one topic. Yet, there are many images in which some regions cannot be assigned a crisp categorical label (e.g., transition regions between a foggy sky and the ground or between sand and water at a beach). In these cases, a visual word is best represented with partial memberships across multiple topics. To address this, we present a partial membership latent Dirichlet allocation (PM-LDA) model and an associated parameter estimation algorithm. This model can be useful for imagery where a visual word may be a mixture of multiple topics. Experimental results on visual and sonar imagery show that PM-LDA can produce both crisp and soft semantic image segmentations; a capability previous topic modeling methods do not have.",0

First, the background is represented using a suitable smooth model, which is a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis functions, and the foreground text and graphics are modeled as a sparse component overlaid on the smooth background. Then the background and foreground are separated using a sparse decomposition framework and imposing some prior information, which promote the smoothness of background, and the sparsity and connectivity of foreground pixels.

"Image segmentation is a popular area of research in computer vision that has many applications in automated image processing. A recent technique called piecewise flat embeddings (PFE) has been proposed for use in image segmentation; PFE transforms image pixel data into a lower dimensional representation where similar pixels are pulled close together and dissimilar pixels are pushed apart. This technique has shown promising results, but its original formulation is not computationally feasible for large images. We propose two improvements to the algorithm for computing PFE: first, we reformulate portions of the algorithm to enable various linear algebra operations to be performed in parallel; second, we propose utilizing an iterative linear solver (preconditioned conjugate gradient) to quickly solve a linear least-squares problem that occurs in the inner loop of a nested iteration. With these two computational improvements, we show on a publicly available image database that PFE can be sped up by an order of magnitude without sacrificing segmentation performance. Our results make this technique more practical for use on large data sets, not only for image segmentation, but for general data clustering problems.",0

By rendering some rational constraints on the initial conditions and the final solutions of the PS functional, we propose two novel formulations which can be approximated to be the explicit solutions of the evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) of the PS model, in which only one PDE needs to be solved efficiently. Furthermore, an energy term that regularizes the level set function to be a signed distance function is incorporated into our evolution formulation, and the time-consuming re-initialization is avoided. Experiments on synthetic and real images show that our method is more efficient than both the PS model and the local binary fitting (LBF) model [4], while having similar segmentation accuracy as the LBF model.",0

"Semantic image segmentation is an essential component of modern autonomous driving systems, as an accurate understanding of the surrounding scene is crucial to navigation and action planning. Current state-of-the-art approaches in semantic image segmentation rely on pre-trained networks that were initially developed for classifying images as a whole. While these networks exhibit outstanding recognition performance (i.e., what is visible?), they lack localization accuracy (i.e., where precisely is something located?). Therefore, additional processing steps have to be performed in order to obtain pixel-accurate segmentation masks at the full image resolution. To alleviate this problem we propose a novel ResNet-like architecture that exhibits strong localization and recognition performance. We combine multi-scale context with pixel-level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network: One stream carries information at the full image resolution, enabling precise adherence to segment boundaries. The other stream undergoes a sequence of pooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition. The two streams are coupled at the full image resolution using residuals. Without additional processing steps and without pre-training, our approach achieves an intersection-over-union score of 71.8% on the Cityscapes dataset.",0

"Boundary incompleteness raises great challenges to automatic prostate segmentation in ultrasound images. Shape prior can provide strong guidance in estimating the missing boundary, but traditional shape models often suffer from hand-crafted descriptors and local information loss in the fitting procedure. In this paper, we attempt to address those issues with a novel framework. The proposed framework can seamlessly integrate feature extraction and shape prior exploring, and estimate the complete boundary with a sequential manner. Our framework is composed of three key modules. Firstly, we serialize the static 2D prostate ultrasound images into dynamic sequences and then predict prostate shapes by sequentially exploring shape priors. Intuitively, we propose to learn the shape prior with the biologically plausible Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This module is corroborated to be effective in dealing with the boundary incompleteness. Secondly, to alleviate the bias caused by different serialization manners, we propose a multi-view fusion strategy to merge shape predictions obtained from different perspectives. Thirdly, we further implant the RNN core into a multiscale Auto-Context scheme to successively refine the details of the shape prediction map. With extensive validation on challenging prostate ultrasound images, our framework bridges severe boundary incompleteness and achieves the best performance in prostate boundary delineation when compared with several advanced methods.

"Size uniformity is one of the main criteria of superpixel methods. But size uniformity rarely conforms to the varying content of an image. The chosen size of the superpixels therefore represents a compromise - how to obtain the fewest superpixels without losing too much important detail. We propose that a more appropriate criterion for creating image segments is information uniformity. We introduce a novel method for segmenting an image based on this criterion. Since information is a natural way of measuring image complexity, our proposed algorithm leads to image segments that are smaller and denser in areas of high complexity and larger in homogeneous regions, thus simplifying the image while preserving its details. Our algorithm is simple and requires just one input parameter - a threshold on the information content. On segmentation comparison benchmarks it proves to be superior to the state-of-the-art. In addition, our method is computationally very efficient, approaching real-time performance, and is easily extensible to three-dimensional image stacks and video volumes.",0

"Unsupervised evaluation of segmentation quality is a crucial step in image segmentation applications. Previous unsupervised evaluation methods usually lacked the adaptability to multi-scale segmentation. A scale-constrained evaluation method that evaluates segmentation quality according to the specified target scale is proposed in this paper.

"Segmenting images of low quality or with missing data is a challenging problem. Integrating statistical prior information about the shapes to be segmented can improve the segmentation results significantly. Most shape-based segmentation algorithms optimize an energy functional and find a point estimate for the object to be segmented. This does not provide a measure of the degree of confidence in that result, neither does it provide a picture of other probable solutions based on the data and the priors. With a statistical view, addressing these issues would involve the problem of characterizing the posterior densities of the shapes of the objects to be segmented. For such characterization, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling-based image segmentation algorithm that uses statistical shape priors. In addition to better characterization of the statistical structure of the problem, such an approach would also have the potential to address issues with getting stuck at local optima, suffered by existing shape-based segmentation methods. Our approach is able to characterize the posterior probability density in the space of shapes through its samples, and to return multiple solutions, potentially from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which would be encountered, e.g., in segmenting objects from multiple shape classes. We present promising results on a variety of data sets. We also provide an extension for segmenting shapes of objects with parts that can go through independent shape variations. This extension involves the use of local shape priors on object parts and provides robustness to limitations in shape training data size.",0

Our approach can generate multiple solutions from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which is useful when segmenting objects from multiple shape classes.

Based on this connection we show that the normalized cut algorithm is equivalent to repeated iterations of bilateral filtering. Then, using this equivalence we present and implement a fast normalized cut algorithm for image segmentation. Experiments show that our implementation can solve the original optimization problem in the normalized cut algorithm 10 to 100 times faster. Furthermore, we present a new algorithm called conditioned normalized cut for image segmentation that can easily incorporate color image patches and demonstrate how this segmentation problem can be solved with edge preserving filtering.",0

"State-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generally consist of at least two successive and distinct computations: a boundary detection process that uses local image information to classify image locations as boundaries between objects, followed by a pixel grouping step such as watershed or connected components that clusters pixels into segments. Prior work has varied the complexity and approach employed in these two steps, including the incorporation of multi-layer neural networks to perform boundary prediction, and the use of global optimizations during pixel clustering. We propose a unified and end-to-end trainable machine learning approach, flood-filling networks, in which a recurrent 3d convolutional network directly produces individual segments from a raw image. The proposed approach robustly segments images with an unknown and variable number of objects as well as highly variable object sizes. We demonstrate the approach on a challenging 3d image segmentation task, connectomic reconstruction from volume electron microscopy data, on which flood-filling neural networks substantially improve accuracy over other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach can replace complex multi-step segmentation pipelines with a single neural network that is learned end-to-end.",0

"We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance.   SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. We show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and more efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures.

"Segmentation is a fundamental task for extracting semantically meaningful regions from an image. The goal of segmentation algorithms is to accurately assign object labels to each image location. However, image-noise, shortcomings of algorithms, and image ambiguities cause uncertainty in label assignment. Estimating the uncertainty in label assignment is important in multiple application domains, such as segmenting tumors from medical images for radiation treatment planning. One way to estimate these uncertainties is through the computation of posteriors of Bayesian models, which is computationally prohibitive for many practical applications. On the other hand, most computationally efficient methods fail to estimate label uncertainty. We therefore propose in this paper the Active Mean Fields (AMF) approach, a technique based on Bayesian modeling that uses a mean-field approximation to efficiently compute a segmentation and its corresponding uncertainty. Based on a variational formulation, the resulting convex model combines any label-likelihood measure with a prior on the length of the segmentation boundary. A specific implementation of that model is the Chan-Vese segmentation model (CV), in which the binary segmentation task is defined by a Gaussian likelihood and a prior regularizing the length of the segmentation boundary. Furthermore, the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the AMF model are equivalent to those of the popular Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model for image denoising. Solutions to the AMF model can thus be implemented by directly utilizing highly-efficient ROF solvers on log-likelihood ratio fields. We qualitatively assess the approach on synthetic data as well as on real natural and medical images. For a quantitative evaluation, we apply our approach to the icgbench dataset.",0

"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can produce images of the eye at the microscopic level. OCT image segmentation to localise retinal layer boundaries is a fundamental procedure for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of retinal and optical nerve disorders. In this paper, we introduce a novel and accurate geodesic distance method (GDM) for OCT segmentation of both healthy and pathological images in either two- or three-dimensional spaces. The method uses a weighted geodesic distance by an exponential function, taking into account both horizontal and vertical intensity variations. The weighted geodesic distance is efficiently calculated from an Eikonal equation via the fast sweeping method. The segmentation is then realised by solving an ordinary differential equation with the geodesic distance. The results of the GDM are compared with manually segmented retinal layer boundaries/surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GDM is robust to complex retinal structures with large curvatures and irregularities and it outperforms the parametric active contour algorithm as well as the graph theoretic based approaches for delineating the retinal layers in both healthy and pathological images.",0

"Segmentation of 3D images is a fundamental problem in biomedical image analysis. Deep learning (DL) approaches have achieved state-of-the-art segmentation perfor- mance. To exploit the 3D contexts using neural networks, known DL segmentation methods, including 3D convolution, 2D convolution on planes orthogonal to 2D image slices, and LSTM in multiple directions, all suffer incompatibility with the highly anisotropic dimensions in common 3D biomedical images. In this paper, we propose a new DL framework for 3D image segmentation, based on a com- bination of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN), which are responsible for exploiting the intra-slice and inter-slice contexts, respectively. To our best knowledge, this is the first DL framework for 3D image segmentation that explicitly leverages 3D image anisotropism. Evaluating using a dataset from the ISBI Neuronal Structure Segmentation Challenge and in-house image stacks for 3D fungus segmentation, our approach achieves promising results comparing to the known DL-based 3D segmentation approaches.",0

"This study proposes an approach to segment human object from a depth image based on histogram of depth values. The region of interest is first extracted based on a predefined threshold for histogram regions. A region growing process is then employed to separate multiple human bodies with the same depth interval. Our contribution is the identification of an adaptive growth threshold based on the detected histogram region. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an application in driver distraction detection was introduced. After successfully extracting the driver's position inside the car, we came up with a simple solution to track the driver motion. With the analysis of the difference between initial and current frame, a change of cluster position or depth value in the interested region, which cross the preset threshold, is considered as a distracted activity. The experiment results demonstrated the success of the algorithm in detecting typical distracted driving activities such as using phone for calling or texting, adjusting internal devices and drinking in real time.",0

"Image segmentation from referring expressions is a joint vision and language modeling task, where the input is an image and a textual expression describing a particular region in the image; and the goal is to localize and segment the specific image region based on the given expression. One major difficulty to train such language-based image segmentation systems is the lack of datasets with joint vision and text annotations. Although existing vision datasets such as MS COCO provide image captions, there are few datasets with region-level textual annotations for images, and these are often smaller in scale. In this paper, we explore how existing large scale vision-only and text-only datasets can be utilized to train models for image segmentation from referring expressions.

"We consider log-supermodular models on binary variables, which are probabilistic models with negative log-densities which are submodular. These models provide probabilistic interpretations of common combinatorial optimization tasks such as image segmentation. In this paper, we focus primarily on parameter estimation in the models from known upper-bounds on the intractable log-partition function. We show that the bound based on separable optimization on the base polytope of the submodular function is always inferior to a bound based on ""perturb-and-MAP"" ideas. Then, to learn parameters, given that our approximation of the log-partition function is an expectation (over our own randomization), we use a stochastic subgradient technique to maximize a lower-bound on the log-likelihood. This can also be extended to conditional maximum likelihood. We illustrate our new results in a set of experiments in binary image denoising, where we highlight the flexibility of a probabilistic model to learn with missing data.",0

"Region-based methods have proven necessary for improving segmentation accuracy of neuronal structures in electron microscopy (EM) images. Most region-based segmentation methods use a scoring function to determine region merging. Such functions are usually learned with supervised algorithms that demand considerable ground truth data, which are costly to collect. We propose a semi-supervised approach that reduces this demand. Based on a merge tree structure, we develop a differentiable unsupervised loss term that enforces consistent predictions from the learned function. We then propose a Bayesian model that combines the supervised and the unsupervised information for probabilistic learning. The experimental results on three EM data sets demonstrate that by using a subset of only 3% to 7% of the entire ground truth data, our approach consistently performs close to the state-of-the-art supervised method with the full labeled data set, and significantly outperforms the supervised method with the same labeled subset.",0

"Semantic image segmentation is a principal problem in computer vision, where the aim is to correctly classify each individual pixel of an image into a semantic label. Its widespread use in many areas, including medical imaging and autonomous driving, has fostered extensive research in recent years. Empirical improvements in tackling this task have primarily been motivated by successful exploitation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-trained for image classification and object recognition. However, the pixel-wise labelling with CNNs has its own unique challenges: (1) an accurate deconvolution, or upsampling, of low-resolution output into a higher-resolution segmentation mask and (2) an inclusion of global information, or context, within locally extracted features. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture to conduct the equivalent of the deconvolution operation globally and acquire dense predictions. We demonstrate that it leads to improved performance of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark, reaching 74.0% mean IU accuracy on the test set.",0

"Recent years have seen tremendous progress in still-image segmentation; however the na\""ive application of these state-of-the-art algorithms to every video frame requires considerable computation and ignores the temporal continuity inherent in video.

We define a novel family of ""clockwork"" convnets driven by fixed or adaptive clock signals that schedule the processing of different layers at different update rates according to their semantic stability. We design a pipeline schedule to reduce latency for real-time recognition and a fixed-rate schedule to reduce overall computation. Finally, we extend clockwork scheduling to adaptive video processing by incorporating data-driven clocks that can be tuned on unlabeled video. The accuracy and efficiency of clockwork convnets are evaluated on the Youtube-Objects, NYUD, and Cityscapes video datasets.",0

"In this paper we propose a CNN architecture for semantic image segmentation. We introduce a new 'bilateral inception' module that can be inserted in existing CNN architectures and performs bilateral filtering, at multiple feature-scales, between superpixels in an image. The feature spaces for bilateral filtering and other parameters of the module are learned end-to-end using standard backpropagation techniques. The bilateral inception module addresses two issues that arise with general CNN segmentation architectures. First, this module propagates information between (super) pixels while respecting image edges, thus using the structured information of the problem for improved results. Second, the layer recovers a full resolution segmentation result from the lower resolution solution of a CNN. In the experiments, we modify several existing CNN architectures by inserting our inception module between the last CNN (1x1 convolution) layers. Empirical results on three different datasets show reliable improvements not only in comparison to the baseline networks, but also in comparison to several dense-pixel prediction techniques such as CRFs, while being competitive in time.",0

"We present in this paper an image segmentation approach that combines a fuzzy semantic region classification and a context based region-growing. Input image is first over-segmented. Then, prior domain knowledge is used to perform a fuzzy classification of these regions to provide a fuzzy semantic labeling. This allows the proposed approach to operate at high level instead of using low-level features and consequently to remedy to the problem of the semantic gap. Each over-segmented region is represented by a vector giving its corresponding membership degrees to the different thematic labels and the whole image is therefore represented by a Regions Partition Matrix. The segmentation is achieved on this matrix instead of the image pixels through two main phases: focusing and propagation. The focusing aims at selecting seeds regions from which information propagation will be performed. Thepropagation phase allows to spread toward others regions and using fuzzy contextual information the needed knowledge ensuring the semantic segmentation.

"Interactive image segmentation is a challenging task and receives increasing attention recently; however, two major drawbacks exist in interactive segmentation approaches. First, the segmentation performance of ROI-based methods is sensitive to the initial ROI: different ROIs may produce results with great difference. Second, most seed-based methods need intense interactions, and are not applicable in many cases. In this work, we generalize the Neutro-Connectedness (NC) to be independent of top-down priors of objects and to model image topology with indeterminacy measurement on image regions, propose a novel method for determining object and background regions, which is applied to exclude isolated background regions and enforce label consistency, and put forward a hybrid interactive segmentation method, Neutro-Connectedness Cut (NC-Cut), which can overcome the above two problems by utilizing both pixel-wise appearance information and region-based NC properties.

In particular, we show that by properly controlling a regularization parameter which determines the structure and the scale of the underlying problem, we are in a position to extract groups of dominant-set clusters which are constrained to contain user-selected elements. The resulting algorithm can deal naturally with any type of input modality, including scribbles, sloppy contours, and bounding boxes, and is able to robustly handle noisy annotations on the part of the user. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our approach as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on a variety of natural images under several input conditions.",0

We formulate the tree structure as a constrained conditional model to associate region merging with likelihoods predicted using an ensemble boundary classifier. Final segmentations can then be inferred by finding globally optimal solutions to the model efficiently.

"Localizing functional regions of objects or affordances is an important aspect of scene understanding. In this work, we cast the problem of affordance segmentation as that of semantic image segmentation. In order to explore various levels of supervision, we introduce a pixel-annotated affordance dataset of 3090 images containing 9916 object instances with rich contextual information in terms of human-object interactions. We use a deep convolutional neural network within an expectation maximization framework to take advantage of weakly labeled data like image level annotations or keypoint annotations. We show that a further reduction in supervision is possible with a minimal loss in performance when human pose is used as context.",0

"Sparse decomposition has been widely used for different applications, such as source separation, image classification, image denoising and more. This paper presents a new algorithm for segmentation of an image into background and foreground text and graphics using sparse decomposition and total variation minimization. The proposed method is designed based on the assumption that the background part of the image is smoothly varying and can be represented by a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis functions, while the foreground text and graphics can be modeled with a sparse component overlaid on the smooth background. The background and foreground are separated using a sparse decomposition framework regularized with a few suitable regularization terms which promotes the sparsity and connectivity of foreground pixels. This algorithm has been tested on a dataset of images extracted from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding, and is shown to have superior performance over some prior methods, including least absolute deviation fitting, k-means clustering based segmentation in DjVu and shape primitive extraction and coding (SPEC) algorithm.",0

"The semantic image segmentation task presents a trade-off between test time accuracy and training-time annotation cost. Detailed per-pixel annotations enable training accurate models but are very time-consuming to obtain, image-level class labels are an order of magnitude cheaper but result in less accurate models. We take a natural step from image-level annotation towards stronger supervision: we ask annotators to point to an object if one exists. We incorporate this point supervision along with a novel objectness potential in the training loss function of a CNN model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark reveal that the combined effect of point-level supervision and objectness potential yields an improvement of 12.9% mIOU over image-level supervision. Further, we demonstrate that models trained with point-level supervision are more accurate than models trained with image-level, squiggle-level or full supervision given a fixed annotation budget.",0

"We introduce a deep learning image segmentation framework that is extremely robust to missing imaging modalities. Instead of attempting to impute or synthesize missing data, the proposed approach learns, for each modality, an embedding of the input image into a single latent vector space for which arithmetic operations (such as taking the mean) are well defined. Points in that space, which are averaged over modalities available at inference time, can then be further processed to yield the desired segmentation. As such, any combinatorial subset of available modalities can be provided as input, without having to learn a combinatorial number of imputation models. Evaluated on two neurological MRI datasets (brain tumors and MS lesions), the approach yields state-of-the-art segmentation results when provided with all modalities; moreover, its performance degrades remarkably gracefully when modalities are removed, significantly more so than alternative mean-filling or other synthesis approaches.",0

"The random walker (RW) algorithm is used for both image segmentation and registration, and possesses several useful properties that make it popular in medical imaging, such as being globally optimizable, allowing user interaction, and providing uncertainty information. The RW algorithm defines a weighted graph over an image and uses the graph's Laplacian matrix to regularize its solutions. This regularization reduces to solving a large system of equations, which may be excessively time consuming in some applications, such as when interacting with a human user. Techniques have been developed that precompute eigenvectors of a Laplacian offline, after image acquisition but before any analysis, in order speed up the RW algorithm online, when segmentation or registration is being performed. However, precomputation requires certain algorithm parameters be fixed offline, limiting their flexibility. In this paper, we develop techniques to update the precomputed data online when RW parameters are altered. Specifically, we dynamically determine the number of eigenvectors needed for a desired accuracy based on user input, and derive update equations for the eigenvectors when the edge weights or topology of the image graph are changed. We present results demonstrating that our techniques make RW with precomputation much more robust to offline settings while only sacrificing minimal accuracy.",0

"This paper considers how to separate text and/or graphics from smooth background in screen content and mixed document images and proposes two approaches to perform this segmentation task. The proposed methods make use of the fact that the background in each block is usually smoothly varying and can be modeled well by a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis functions, while the foreground text and graphics create sharp discontinuity. The algorithms separate the background and foreground pixels by trying to fit background pixel values in the block into a smooth function using two different schemes. One is based on robust regression, where the inlier pixels will be considered as background, while remaining outlier pixels will be considered foreground. The second approach uses a sparse decomposition framework where the background and foreground layers are modeled with a smooth and sparse components respectively.

"Level set methods are widely used for image segmentation because of their capability to handle topological changes. In this paper, we propose a novel parametric level set method called Disjunctive Normal Level Set (DNLS), and apply it to both two phase (single object) and multiphase (multi-object) image segmentations. The DNLS is formed by union of polytopes which themselves are formed by intersections of half-spaces. The proposed level set framework has the following major advantages compared to other level set methods available in the literature. First, segmentation using DNLS converges much faster. Second, the DNLS level set function remains regular throughout its evolution. Third, the proposed multiphase version of the DNLS is less sensitive to initialization, and its computational cost and memory requirement remains almost constant as the number of objects to be simultaneously segmented grows.

This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called ""semantic image segmentation"").

"Image segmentation is often performed on medical images for identifying diseases in clinical evaluation. Hence it has become one of the major research areas. Conventional image segmentation techniques are unable to provide satisfactory segmentation results for medical images as they contain irregularities.

The first stage automatically generates a binary marker image of the region of interest using mathematical morphology. This marker serves as the mask image for the second stage which uses GrabCut on the input image thus resulting in an efficient segmented result.

"Unsupervised image segmentation algorithms aim at identifying disjoint homogeneous regions in an image, and have been subject to considerable attention in the machine vision community. In this paper, a popular theoretical model with it's origins in statistical physics and social dynamics, known as the Deffuant-Weisbuch model, is applied to the image segmentation problem. The Deffuant-Weisbuch model has been found to be useful in modelling the evolution of a closed system of interacting agents characterised by their opinions or beliefs, leading to the formation of clusters of agents who share a similar opinion or belief at steady state. In the context of image segmentation, this paper considers a pixel as an agent and it's colour property as it's opinion, with opinion updates as per the Deffuant-Weisbuch model. Apart from applying the basic model to image segmentation, this paper incorporates adjacency and neighbourhood information in the model, which factors in the local similarity and smoothness properties of images. Convergence is reached when the number of unique pixel opinions, i.e., the number of colour centres, matches the pre-specified number of clusters.

"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the backbone of state-of-art semantic image segmentation systems. Recent work has shown that complementing CNNs with fully-connected conditional random fields (CRFs) can significantly enhance their object localization accuracy, yet dense CRF inference is computationally expensive. We propose replacing the fully-connected CRF with domain transform (DT), a modern edge-preserving filtering method in which the amount of smoothing is controlled by a reference edge map. Domain transform filtering is several times faster than dense CRF inference and we show that it yields comparable semantic segmentation results, accurately capturing object boundaries. Importantly, our formulation allows learning the reference edge map from intermediate CNN features instead of using the image gradient magnitude as in standard DT filtering. This produces task-specific edges in an end-to-end trainable system optimizing the target semantic segmentation quality.",0
"Cutting-edge semantic image segmentation systems rely heavily on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, to enhance object localization accuracy, recent research has introduced fully-connected conditional random fields (CRFs) as a complementary tool to CNNs. While dense CRF inference is effective, it is also computationally expensive. Our solution is to replace fully-connected CRFs with domain transform (DT), which is a contemporary edge-preserving filtering technique. DT offers faster processing times compared to dense CRF inference, while also producing comparable semantic segmentation results that accurately capture object boundaries. Our approach is unique because it allows for learning the reference edge map from intermediate CNN features, resulting in task-specific edges in an end-to-end trainable system that optimizes the target semantic segmentation quality.",1
"Incorporating multi-scale features in fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) has been a key element to achieving state-of-the-art performance on semantic image segmentation. One common way to extract multi-scale features is to feed multiple resized input images to a shared deep network and then merge the resulting features for pixelwise classification. In this work, we propose an attention mechanism that learns to softly weight the multi-scale features at each pixel location. We adapt a state-of-the-art semantic image segmentation model, which we jointly train with multi-scale input images and the attention model. The proposed attention model not only outperforms average- and max-pooling, but allows us to diagnostically visualize the importance of features at different positions and scales. Moreover, we show that adding extra supervision to the output at each scale is essential to achieving excellent performance when merging multi-scale features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, including PASCAL-Person-Part, PASCAL VOC 2012 and a subset of MS-COCO 2014.",0

"Commonly used human motion capture systems require intrusive attachment of markers that are visually tracked with multiple cameras. In this work we present an efficient and inexpensive solution to markerless motion capture using only a few Kinect sensors. Unlike the previous work on 3d pose estimation using a single depth camera, we relax constraints on the camera location and do not assume a co-operative user. We apply recent image segmentation techniques to depth images and use curriculum learning to train our system on purely synthetic data. Our method accurately localizes body parts without requiring an explicit shape model. The body joint locations are then recovered by combining evidence from multiple views in real-time. We also introduce a dataset of ~6 million synthetic depth frames for pose estimation from multiple cameras and exceed state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley MHAD dataset.",0

"Image segmentation, the process of separating the elements within an image, is frequently used for obtaining information from photomicrographs. However, segmentation methods should be used with reservations: incorrect segmentation can mislead when interpreting regions of interest (ROI), thus decreasing the success rate of additional procedures.

"We propose an approach to instance-level image segmentation that is built on top of category-level segmentation. Specifically, for each pixel in a semantic category mask, its corresponding instance bounding box is predicted using a deep fully convolutional regression network.

"It is well-known in image processing that computational cost increases rapidly with the number and dimensions of the images to be processed. Several fields, such as medical imaging, routinely use numerous very large images, which might also be 3D and/or captured at several frequency bands, all adding to the computational expense. Multiresolution analysis is a method of increasing the efficiency of the segmentation process. One multiresolution approach is the coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, whereby the segmentation starts at a coarse resolution and is then fine-tuned during subsequent steps. The starting resolution for segmentation is generally selected arbitrarily with no clear selection criteria. The research reported in this paper showed that starting from different resolutions for image segmentation results in different accuracies and computational times, even for images of the same category (depicting similar scenes or objects). An automated method for resolution selection for an input image would thus be beneficial. This paper introduces a framework for the automated selection of the best resolution for image segmentation. We propose a measure for defining the best resolution based on user/system criteria, offering a trade-off between accuracy and computation time. A learning approach is then introduced for the selection of the resolution, whereby extracted image features are mapped to the previously determined best resolution. In the learning process, class (i.e., resolution) distribution is generally imbalanced, making effective learning from the data difficult. Experiments conducted with three datasets using two different segmentation algorithms show that the resolutions selected through learning enable much faster segmentation than the original ones, while retaining at least the original accuracy.",0

However, the starting resolution for segmentation is generally selected arbitrarily, resulting in varying accuracies and computational times. This paper presents a framework for the automated selection of the optimal resolution for image segmentation, offering a balance between accuracy and computation time. A learning approach is employed, where image features are mapped to the best resolution and used to select the ideal resolution for an input image. Class distribution in the learning process is often imbalanced, making effective learning difficult.

"Superpixel segmentation is becoming ubiquitous in computer vision. In practice, an object can either be represented by a number of segments in finer levels of detail or included in a surrounding region at coarser levels of detail, and thus a superpixel segmentation hierarchy is useful for applications that require different levels of image segmentation detail depending on the particular image objects segmented. Unfortunately, there is no method that can generate all scales of superpixels accurately in real-time. As a result, a simple yet effective algorithm named Super Hierarchy (SH) is proposed in this paper. It is as accurate as the state-of-the-art but 1-2 orders of magnitude faster. The proposed method can be directly integrated with recent efficient edge detectors like the structured forest edges to significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of segmentation accuracy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation on a number of computer vision applications was conducted, demonstrating that the proposed method is the top performer.",0

"Recent applications in computer vision have come to heavily rely on superpixel over-segmentation as a pre-processing step for higher level vision tasks, such as object recognition, image labelling or image segmentation. Here we present a new superpixel algorithm called Hierarchical Piecewise-Constant Super-regions (HPCS), which not only obtains superpixels comparable to the state-of-the-art, but can also be applied hierarchically to form what we call n-th order super-regions. In essence, a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based anisotropic denoising formulation over the quantized feature space is adopted to form piecewise-constant image regions, which are then combined with a graph-based split & merge post-processing step to form superpixels. The graph and quantized feature based formulation of the problem allows us to generalize it hierarchically to preserve boundary adherence with fewer superpixels. Experimental results show that, despite the simplicity of our framework, it is able to provide high quality superpixels, and to hierarchically apply them to form layers of over-segmentation, each with a decreasing number of superpixels, while maintaining the same desired properties (such as adherence to strong image edges).

"Image segmentation in the medical domain is a challenging field owing to poor resolution and limited contrast.

"This paper proposes a joint segmentation and deconvolution Bayesian method for medical ultrasound (US) images. Contrary to piecewise homogeneous images, US images exhibit heavy characteristic speckle patterns correlated with the tissue structures. The generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) has been shown to be one of the most relevant distributions for characterizing the speckle in US images. Thus, we propose a GGD-Potts model defined by a label map coupling US image segmentation and deconvolution. The Bayesian estimators of the unknown model parameters, including the US image, the label map and all the hyperparameters are difficult to be expressed in closed form. Thus, we investigate a Gibbs sampler to generate samples distributed according to the posterior of interest. These generated samples are finally used to compute the Bayesian estimators of the unknown parameters. The performance of the proposed Bayesian model is compared with existing approaches via several experiments conducted on realistic synthetic data and in vivo US images.",0

"In computer vision, many problems such as image segmentation, pixel labelling, and scene parsing can be formulated as binary quadratic programs (BQPs). For submodular problems, cuts based methods can be employed to efficiently solve large-scale problems. However, general nonsubmodular problems are significantly more challenging to solve. Finding a solution when the problem is of large size to be of practical interest, however, typically requires relaxation. Two standard relaxation methods are widely used for solving general BQPs--spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP), each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and easy to implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a tighter bound, but its computational complexity is high, especially for large scale problems. In this work, we present a new SDP formulation for BQPs, with two desirable properties. First, it has a similar relaxation bound to conventional SDP formulations. Second, compared with conventional SDP methods, the new SDP formulation leads to a significantly more efficient and scalable dual optimization approach, which has the same degree of complexity as spectral methods. We then propose two solvers, namely, quasi-Newton and smoothing Newton methods, for the dual problem. Both of them are significantly more efficiently than standard interior-point methods. In practice, the smoothing Newton solver is faster than the quasi-Newton solver for dense or medium-sized problems, while the quasi-Newton solver is preferable for large sparse/structured problems.

"We propose a framework for top-down salient object detection that incorporates a tightly coupled image classification module.

The category-aware sparse coding produces better image classification accuracy as compared to conventional sparse coding with a reduced computational complexity. A saliency-weighted max-pooling is proposed to improve image classification, which is further used to refine the saliency maps.

One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate mean-field approximate inference for the Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.",0

"In this paper a hierarchical model for pixel clustering and image segmentation is developed. In the model an image is hierarchically structured. The original image is treated as a set of nested images, which are capable to reversibly merge with each other. An object is defined as a structural element of an image, so that, an image is regarded as a maximal object. The simulating of none-hierarchical optimal pixel clustering by hierarchical clustering is studied. To generate a hierarchy of optimized piecewise constant image approximations, estimated by the standard deviation of approximation from the image, the conversion of any hierarchy of approximations into the hierarchy described in relation to the number of intensity levels by convex sequence of total squared errors is proposed.",0

"Spectral embedding provides a framework for solving perceptual organization problems, including image segmentation and figure/ground organization. From an affinity matrix describing pairwise relationships between pixels, it clusters pixels into regions, and, using a complex-valued extension, orders pixels according to layer. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly predict the pairwise relationships that define this affinity matrix. Spectral embedding then resolves these predictions into a globally-consistent segmentation and figure/ground organization of the scene. Experiments demonstrate significant benefit to this direct coupling compared to prior works which use explicit intermediate stages, such as edge detection, on the pathway from image to affinities. Our results suggest spectral embedding as a powerful alternative to the conditional random field (CRF)-based globalization schemes typically coupled to deep neural networks.",0

"Extracting a connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) data set requires identification of neurons and determination of synapses between neurons. As manual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been extensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide and eventually replace manual tracing. Until recently, there has been comparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses between neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several factors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a connectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating synapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in determining connections.   However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a sufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has improved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more significant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get worse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we address this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect pre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular, pre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive Network, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features conditioned on the local segmentation.   This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages advances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for polyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our algorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that complete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most connectivity correctly.",0

"Computer vision has become a major source of information for autonomous navigation of robots of various types, self-driving cars, military robots and mars/lunar rovers are some examples. Nevertheless, the majority of methods focus on analysing images captured in visible spectrum. In this manuscript we elaborate on the problem of segmenting cross-country scenes captured in IR spectrum. For this purpose we proposed employing salient features. Salient features are robust to variations in scale, brightness and view angle. We suggest the Speeded-Up Robust Features as a basis for our salient features for a number of reasons discussed in the paper. We also provide a comparison of two SURF implementations. The SURF features are extracted from images of different terrain types. For every feature we estimate a terrain class membership function. The membership values are obtained by means of either the multi-layer perceptron or nearest neighbours. The features' class membership values and their spatial positions are then applied to estimate class membership values for all pixels in the image. To decrease the effect of segmentation blinking that is caused by rapid switching between different terrain types and to speed up segmentation, we are tracking camera position and predict features' positions. The comparison of the multi-layer perception and the nearest neighbour classifiers is presented in the paper. The error rate of the terrain segmentation using the nearest neighbours obtained on the testing set is 16.6+-9.17%.",0

"Topic models (e.g., pLSA, LDA, SLDA) have been widely used for segmenting imagery. These models are confined to crisp segmentation. Yet, there are many images in which some regions cannot be assigned a crisp label (e.g., transition regions between a foggy sky and the ground or between sand and water at a beach). In these cases, a visual word is best represented with partial memberships across multiple topics. To address this, we present a partial membership latent Dirichlet allocation (PM-LDA) model and associated parameter estimation algorithms. Experimental results on two natural image datasets and one SONAR image dataset show that PM-LDA can produce both crisp and soft semantic image segmentations; a capability existing methods do not have.",0

"Color image segmentation is a crucial step in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications. This article introduces an adaptive and unsupervised clustering approach based on Voronoi regions, which can be applied to solve the color image segmentation problem.

"A novel global energy model for multi-class semantic image segmentation is proposed that admits very efficient exact inference and derivative calculations for learning. Inference in this model is equivalent to MAP inference in a particular kind of vector-valued Gaussian Markov random field, and ultimately reduces to solving a linear system of linear PDEs known as a reaction-diffusion system. Solving this system can be achieved in time scaling near-linearly in the number of image pixels by reducing it to sequential FFTs, after a linear change of basis. The efficiency and differentiability of the model make it especially well-suited for integration with convolutional neural networks, even allowing it to be used in interior, feature-generating layers and stacked multiple times.

"The paper proposes a novel Kernelized image segmentation scheme for noisy images that utilizes the concept of Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) and incorporates spatial constraints by computing circular colour map induced weights. Fuzzy damping coefficients are obtained for each nucleus or center pixel on the basis of the corresponding weighted SUSAN area values, the weights being equal to the inverse of the number of horizontal and vertical moves required to reach a neighborhood pixel from the center pixel. These weights are used to vary the contributions of the different nuclei in the Kernel based framework. The paper also presents an edge quality metric obtained by fuzzy decision based edge candidate selection and final computation of the blurriness of the edges after their selection. The inability of existing algorithms to preserve edge information and structural details in their segmented maps necessitates the computation of the edge quality factor (EQF) for all the competing algorithms. Qualitative and quantitative analysis have been rendered with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms and for images ridden with varying types of noises. Speckle noise ridden SAR images and Rician noise ridden Magnetic Resonance Images have also been considered for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in extracting important segmentation information.",0

"Generating natural language descriptions for in-the-wild videos is a challenging task. Most state-of-the-art methods for solving this problem borrow existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (AlexNet, GoogLeNet) to extract a visual representation of the input video. However, these deep CNN architectures are designed for single-label centered-positioned object classification. While they generate strong semantic features, they have no inherent structure allowing them to detect multiple objects of different sizes and locations in the frame. Our paper tries to solve this problem by integrating the base CNN into several fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) to form a multi-scale network that handles multiple receptive field sizes in the original image. FCNs, previously applied to image segmentation, can generate class heat-maps efficiently compared to sliding window mechanisms, and can easily handle multiple scales. To further handle the ambiguity over multiple objects and locations, we incorporate the Multiple Instance Learning mechanism (MIL) to consider objects in different positions and at different scales simultaneously. We integrate our multi-scale multi-instance architecture with a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network to generate sentence descriptions based on the visual representation. Ours is the first end-to-end trainable architecture that is capable of multi-scale region processing. Evaluation on a Youtube video dataset shows the advantage of our approach compared to the original single-scale whole frame CNN model.

"We propose a novel unsupervised image segmentation algorithm, which aims to segment an image into several coherent parts. It requires no user input, no supervised learning phase and assumes an unknown number of segments. It achieves this by first over-segmenting the image into several hundred superpixels. These are iteratively joined on the basis of a discriminative classifier trained on color and texture information obtained from each superpixel. The output of the classifier is regularized by a Markov random field that lends more influence to neighbouring superpixels that are more similar. In each iteration, similar superpixels fall under the same label, until only a few coherent regions remain in the image.

"Tackling pattern recognition problems in areas such as computer vision, bioinformatics, speech or text recognition is often done best by taking into account task-specific statistical relations between output variables. In structured prediction, this internal structure is used to predict multiple outputs simultaneously, leading to more accurate and coherent predictions. Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are nonprobabilistic models that optimize a joint input-output function through margin-based learning. Because SSVMs generally disregard the interplay between unary and interaction factors during the training phase, final parameters are suboptimal. Moreover, its factors are often restricted to linear combinations of input features, limiting its generalization power. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes: (i) Joint inference and learning by integration of back-propagation and loss-augmented inference in SSVM subgradient descent; (ii) Extending SSVM factors to neural networks that form highly nonlinear functions of input features.

"A multi-scale greedy-based object proposal generation approach is presented. Based on the multi-scale nature of objects in images, our approach is built on top of a hierarchical segmentation.

Object proposals are obtained by selecting a subset from the multi-scale segment pool via maximizing a submodular objective function, which consists of a weighted coverage term, a single-scale diversity term and a multi-scale reward term. The weighted coverage term forces the selected set of object proposals to be representative and compact; the single-scale diversity term encourages choosing segments from different exemplar clusters so that they will cover as many object patterns as possible; the multi-scale reward term encourages the selected proposals to be discriminative and selected from multiple layers generated by the hierarchical image segmentation.

"In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used for disaggregation of SMAP brightness temperatures (T$_{\textrm{B}}$) from 36km to 9km.

"The present paper introduces the $\eta$ and {\eta} connections in order to add regional information on $\lambda$-flat zones, which only take into account a local information. A top-down approach is considered. First $\lambda$-flat zones are built in a way leading to a sub-segmentation. Then a finer segmentation is obtained by computing $\eta$-bounded regions and $\mu$-geodesic balls inside the $\lambda$-flat zones. The proposed algorithms for the construction of new partitions are based on queues with an ordered selection of seeds using the cumulative distance. $\eta$-bounded regions offers a control on the variations of amplitude in the class from a point, called center, and $\mu$-geodesic balls controls the ""size"" of the class. These results are applied to hyperspectral images.",0

The approach taken is top-down, beginning with the creation of $\lambda$-flat zones that facilitate sub-segmentation. The next step involves producing a more detailed segmentation using $\eta$-bounded regions and $\mu$-geodesic balls within the $\lambda$-flat zones. The algorithms used to generate these new partitions are queue-based and prioritize seeds through cumulative distance. $\eta$-bounded regions control amplitude variation within a class from a center point, while $\mu$-geodesic balls regulate class size. The efficacy of these techniques is demonstrated with hyperspectral imagery.",1
"Despite the great advances made in the field of image super-resolution (ISR) during the last years, the performance has merely been evaluated perceptually. Thus, it is still unclear whether ISR is helpful for other vision tasks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study and analysis of the usefulness of ISR for other vision applications. In particular, six ISR methods are evaluated on four popular vision tasks, namely edge detection, semantic image segmentation, digit recognition, and scene recognition. We show that applying ISR to input images of other vision systems does improve their performance when the input images are of low-resolution. We also study the correlation between four standard perceptual evaluation criteria (namely PSNR, SSIM, IFC, and NQM) and the usefulness of ISR to the vision tasks. Experiments show that they correlate well with each other in general, but perceptual criteria are still not accurate enough to be used as full proxies for the usefulness. We hope this work will inspire the community to evaluate ISR methods also in real vision applications, and to adopt ISR as a pre-processing step of other vision tasks if the resolution of their input images is low.",0

"We study the applicability of a set of texture descriptors introduced in recent work by the author to texture-based segmentation of images. The texture descriptors under investigation result from applying graph indices from quantitative graph theory to graphs encoding the local structure of images. The underlying graphs arise from the computation of morphological amoebas as structuring elements for adaptive morphology, either as weighted or unweighted Dijkstra search trees or as edge-weighted pixel graphs within structuring elements. In the present paper we focus on texture descriptors in which the graph indices are entropy-based, and use them in a geodesic active contour framework for image segmentation. Experiments on several synthetic and one real-world image are shown to demonstrate texture segmentation by this approach. Forthermore, we undertake an attempt to analyse selected entropy-based texture descriptors with regard to what information about texture they actually encode.

"One popular approach to interactively segment the foreground object of interest from an image is to annotate a bounding box that covers the foreground object. Then, a binary labeling is performed to achieve a refined segmentation. One major issue of the existing algorithms for such interactive image segmentation is their preference of an input bounding box that tightly encloses the foreground object. This increases the annotation burden, and prevents these algorithms from utilizing automatically detected bounding boxes. In this paper, we develop a new LooseCut algorithm that can handle cases where the input bounding box only loosely covers the foreground object. We propose a new Markov Random Fields (MRF) model for segmentation with loosely bounded boxes, including a global similarity constraint to better distinguish the foreground and background, and an additional energy term to encourage consistent labeling of similar-appearance pixels. This MRF model is then solved by an iterated max-flow algorithm. In the experiments, we evaluate LooseCut in three publicly-available image datasets, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation algorithms. We also show that LooseCut can be used for enhancing the performance of unsupervised video segmentation and image saliency detection.",0

"Image segmentation is the problem of partitioning an image into different subsets, where each subset may have a different characterization in terms of color, intensity, texture, and/or other features. Segmentation is a fundamental component of image processing, and plays a significant role in computer vision, object recognition, and object tracking. Active Contour Models (ACMs) constitute a powerful energy-based minimization framework for image segmentation, which relies on the concept of contour evolution. Starting from an initial guess, the contour is evolved with the aim of approximating better and better the actual object boundary. Handling complex images in an efficient, effective, and robust way is a real challenge, especially in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity, overlap between the foreground/background intensity distributions, objects characterized by many different intensities, and/or additive noise. In this thesis, to deal with these challenges, we propose a number of image segmentation models relying on variational level set methods and specific kinds of neural networks, to handle complex images in both supervised and unsupervised ways. Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of the segmentation results, obtained by the proposed models on various benchmark synthetic and real images compared with state-of-the-art active contour models.",0

"This paper addresses semantic image segmentation by incorporating rich information into Markov Random Field (MRF), including high-order relations and mixture of label contexts. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN), which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass. Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN architecture to model unary terms and additional layers are carefully devised to approximate the mean field algorithm (MF) for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the recent works that combined CNN and MRF, where many iterations of MF were required for each training image during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing works as its special cases. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). DPN is thoroughly evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, where a single DPN model yields a new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.",0

"Every segmentation algorithm has parameters that need to be adjusted in order to achieve good results. Evolving fuzzy systems for adjustment of segmentation parameters have been proposed recently (Evolving fuzzy image segmentation -- EFIS [1]. However, similar to any other algorithm, EFIS too suffers from a few limitations when used in practice. As a major drawback, EFIS depends on detection of the object of interest for feature calculation, a task that is highly application-dependent. In this paper, a new version of EFIS is proposed to overcome these limitations. The new EFIS, called self-configuring EFIS (SC-EFIS), uses available training data to auto-configure the parameters that are fixed in EFIS. As well, the proposed SC-EFIS relies on a feature selection process that does not require the detection of a region of interest (ROI).",0

"Deep structured output learning shows great promise in tasks like semantic image segmentation. We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured prediction with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). With such CNN message estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient iteration. The network output dimension for message estimation is the same as the number of classes, in contrast to the network output for general CNN potential functions in CRFs, which is exponential in the order of the potentials. Hence CNN message learning has fewer network parameters and is more scalable for cases that a large number of classes are involved. We apply our method to semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We achieve an intersection-over-union score of 73.4 on its test set, which is the best reported result for methods using the VOC training images alone.

"Segmenting an image into multiple components is a central task in computer vision. In many practical scenarios, prior knowledge about plausible components is available. Incorporating such prior knowledge into models and algorithms for image segmentation is highly desirable, yet can be non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a new approach that allows, for the first time, to constrain some or all components of a segmentation to have convex shapes. Specifically, we extend the Minimum Cost Multicut Problem by a class of constraints that enforce convexity. To solve instances of this APX-hard integer linear program to optimality, we separate the proposed constraints in the branch-and-cut loop of a state-of-the-art ILP solver. Results on natural and biological images demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach as well as its advantage over the state-of-the-art heuristic.",0

The maps obtained for the different partitions are then integrated into a final saliency map. The second model directly works on the structure created by the segmentation algorithm, computing saliency at each node and integrating these cues in a straightforward manner into a single saliency map.

"Action recognition from still images is an important task of computer vision applications such as image annotation, robotic navigation, video surveillance and several others. Existing approaches mainly rely on either bag-of-feature representations or articulated body-part models. However, the relationship between the action and the image segments is still substantially unexplored. For this reason, in this paper we propose to approach action recognition by leveraging an intermediate layer of ""superpixels"" whose latent classes can act as attributes of the action. In the proposed approach, the action class is predicted by a structural model(learnt by Latent Structural SVM) based on measurements from the image superpixels and their latent classes.

"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be shifted across 2D images or 3D videos to segment them. They have a fixed input size and typically perceive only small local contexts of the pixels to be classified as foreground or background. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional Recurrent NNs (MD-RNNs) can perceive the entire spatio-temporal context of each pixel in a few sweeps through all pixels, especially when the RNN is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Despite these theoretical advantages, however, unlike CNNs, previous MD-LSTM variants were hard to parallelize on GPUs. Here we re-arrange the traditional cuboid order of computations in MD-LSTM in pyramidal fashion. The resulting PyraMiD-LSTM is easy to parallelize, especially for 3D data such as stacks of brain slice images.

"Since their introduction in the shape analysis community, functional maps have met with considerable success due to their ability to compactly represent dense correspondences between deformable shapes, with applications ranging from shape matching and image segmentation, to exploration of large shape collections. Despite the numerous advantages of such representation, however, the problem of converting a given functional map back to a point-to-point map has received a surprisingly limited interest. In this paper we analyze the general problem of point-wise map recovery from arbitrary functional maps. In doing so, we rule out many of the assumptions required by the currently established approach -- most notably, the limiting requirement of the input shapes being nearly-isometric. We devise an efficient recovery process based on a simple probabilistic model. Experiments confirm that this approach achieves remarkable accuracy improvements in very challenging cases.",0

"Multi-atlas segmentation (MAS), first introduced and popularized by the pioneering work of Rohlfing, Brandt, Menzel and Maurer Jr (2004), Klein, Mensh, Ghosh, Tourville and Hirsch (2005), and Heckemann, Hajnal, Aljabar, Rueckert and Hammers (2006), is becoming one of the most widely-used and successful image segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. By manipulating and utilizing the entire dataset of ""atlases"" (training images that have been previously labeled, e.g., manually by an expert), rather than some model-based average representation, MAS has the flexibility to better capture anatomical variation, thus offering superior segmentation accuracy. This benefit, however, typically comes at a high computational cost. Recent advancements in computer hardware and image processing software have been instrumental in addressing this challenge and facilitated the wide adoption of MAS. Today, MAS has come a long way and the approach includes a wide array of sophisticated algorithms that employ ideas from machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization, and computer vision, among other fields.

"This paper presents a new probabilistic generative model for image segmentation, i.e. the task of partitioning an image into homogeneous regions. Our model is grounded on a mid-level image representation, called a region tree, in which regions are recursively split into subregions until superpixels are reached. Given the region tree, image segmentation is formalized as sampling cuts in the tree from the model. Inference for the cuts is exact, and formulated using dynamic programming. Our tree-cut model can be tuned to sample segmentations at a particular scale of interest out of many possible multiscale image segmentations. This generalizes the common notion that there should be only one correct segmentation per image. Also, it allows moving beyond the standard single-scale evaluation, where the segmentation result for an image is averaged against the corresponding set of coarse and fine human annotations, to conduct a scale-specific evaluation. Our quantitative results are comparable to those of the leading gPb-owt-ucm method, with the notable advantage that we additionally produce a distribution over all possible tree-consistent segmentations of the image.",0

"Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, computing pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called PISA, which stands for Pixelwise Image Saliency Aggregating various bottom-up cues and priors. It generates spatially coherent yet detail-preserving, pixel-accurate and fine-grained saliency, and overcomes the limitations of previous methods which use homogeneous superpixel-based and color only treatment. PISA aggregates multiple saliency cues in a global context such as complementary color and structure contrast measures with their spatial priors in the image domain. The saliency confidence is further jointly modeled with a neighborhood consistence constraint into an energy minimization formulation, in which each pixel will be evaluated with multiple hypothetical saliency levels. Instead of using global discrete optimization methods, we employ the cost-volume filtering technique to solve our formulation, assigning the saliency levels smoothly while preserving the edge-aware structure details. In addition, a faster version of PISA is developed using a gradient-driven image sub-sampling strategy to greatly improve the runtime efficiency while keeping comparable detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on a number of public datasets suggest that PISA convincingly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, with this work we also create a new dataset containing $800$ commodity images for evaluating saliency detection.

"In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object saliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our approach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image based on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the class-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be efficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy between the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map for the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods to learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in order to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our methods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per second in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image segmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft COCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate high-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In particular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which contain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects, and/or very small salient objects.",0

"In this chapter we review the main literature related to kernel spectral clustering (KSC), an approach to clustering cast within a kernel-based optimization setting. KSC represents a least-squares support vector machine based formulation of spectral clustering described by a weighted kernel PCA objective. Just as in the classifier case, the binary clustering model is expressed by a hyperplane in a high dimensional space induced by a kernel. In addition, the multi-way clustering can be obtained by combining a set of binary decision functions via an Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) encoding scheme. Because of its model-based nature, the KSC method encompasses three main steps: training, validation, testing. In the validation stage model selection is performed to obtain tuning parameters, like the number of clusters present in the data. This is a major advantage compared to classical spectral clustering where the determination of the clustering parameters is unclear and relies on heuristics. Once a KSC model is trained on a small subset of the entire data, it is able to generalize well to unseen test points. Beyond the basic formulation, sparse KSC algorithms based on the Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition (ICD) and $L_0$, $L_1, L_0 + L_1$, Group Lasso regularization are reviewed. In that respect, we show how it is possible to handle large scale data. Also, two possible ways to perform hierarchical clustering and a soft clustering method are presented. Finally, real-world applications such as image segmentation, power load time-series clustering, document clustering and big data learning are considered.",0

"Challenging computer vision tasks, in particular semantic image segmentation, require large training sets of annotated images. While obtaining the actual images is often unproblematic, creating the necessary annotation is a tedious and costly process. Therefore, one often has to work with unreliable annotation sources, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or (semi-)automatic algorithmic techniques. In this work, we present a Gaussian process (GP) based technique for simultaneously identifying which images of a training set have unreliable annotation and learning a segmentation model in which the negative effect of these images is suppressed. Alternatively, the model can also just be used to identify the most reliably annotated images from the training set, which can then be used for training any other segmentation method. By relying on ""deep features"" in combination with a linear covariance function, our GP can be learned and its hyperparameter determined efficiently using only matrix operations and gradient-based optimization. This makes our method scalable even to large datasets with several million training instances.",0

"Current image segmentation techniques usually require that the user tune several parameters in order to obtain maximum segmentation accuracy, a computationally inefficient approach, especially when a large number of images must be processed sequentially in daily practice. The use of evolving fuzzy systems for designing a method that automatically adjusts parameters to segment medical images according to the quality expectation of expert users has been proposed recently (Evolving fuzzy image segmentation EFIS). However, EFIS suffers from a few limitations when used in practice mainly due to some fixed parameters. For instance, EFIS depends on auto-detection of the object of interest for feature calculation, a task that is highly application-dependent. This shortcoming limits the applicability of EFIS, which was proposed with the ultimate goal of offering a generic but adjustable segmentation scheme. In this paper, a new version of EFIS is proposed to overcome these limitations. The new EFIS, called self-configuring EFIS (SC-EFIS), uses available training data to self-estimate the parameters that are fixed in EFIS. As well, the proposed SC-EFIS relies on a feature selection process that does not require auto-detection of an ROI. The proposed SC-EFIS was evaluated using the same segmentation algorithms and the same dataset as for EFIS. The results show that SC-EFIS can provide the same results as EFIS but with a higher level of automation.",0
"Typically, current techniques for image segmentation require users to adjust multiple parameters in order to achieve optimal accuracy, which can be time-consuming and impractical when dealing with large quantities of images. Recently, a method called Evolving Fuzzy Image Segmentation (EFIS) has been proposed to automatically adjust parameters based on user expectations. However, EFIS has limitations that restrict its usability, such as a dependence on auto-detection for object of interest and fixed parameters. To address these issues, a new version of EFIS called Self-Configuring EFIS (SC-EFIS) has been developed. SC-EFIS uses available training data to estimate previously fixed parameters and employs a feature selection process that removes the need for auto-detection of a Region of Interest (ROI). Evaluation of SC-EFIS using the same dataset and segmentation algorithms as EFIS showed that it provides comparable results with higher automation.",1
"Contour detection has been a fundamental component in many image segmentation and object detection systems. Most previous work utilizes low-level features such as texture or saliency to detect contours and then use them as cues for a higher-level task such as object detection. However, we claim that recognizing objects and predicting contours are two mutually related tasks. Contrary to traditional approaches, we show that we can invert the commonly established pipeline: instead of detecting contours with low-level cues for a higher-level recognition task, we exploit object-related features as high-level cues for contour detection.   We achieve this goal by means of a multi-scale deep network that consists of five convolutional layers and a bifurcated fully-connected sub-network. The section from the input layer to the fifth convolutional layer is fixed and directly lifted from a pre-trained network optimized over a large-scale object classification task. This section of the network is applied to four different scales of the image input. These four parallel and identical streams are then attached to a bifurcated sub-network consisting of two independently-trained branches. One branch learns to predict the contour likelihood (with a classification objective) whereas the other branch is trained to learn the fraction of human labelers agreeing about the contour presence at a given point (with a regression criterion).   We show that without any feature engineering our multi-scale deep learning approach achieves state-of-the-art results in contour detection.",0

Traditionally, this has been accomplished by utilizing low-level features, such as texture or saliency, to identify contours and then using them as cues for higher-level recognition tasks.

In contrast to conventional methods, we have developed a new approach that uses object-related features as high-level cues for contour detection. Our method employs a multi-scale deep network with five convolutional layers and a bifurcated fully-connected sub-network. The first section of the network is pre-trained for object classification and applied to four different image scales. The four parallel streams are then connected to a bifurcated sub-network, with one branch predicting contour likelihood and the other predicting the fraction of labelers agreeing on contour presence. Remarkably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in contour detection without requiring any feature engineering.",1
"Visual saliency is a fundamental problem in both cognitive and computational sciences, including computer vision. In this CVPR 2015 paper, we discover that a high-quality visual saliency model can be trained with multiscale features extracted using a popular deep learning architecture, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have had many successes in visual recognition tasks. For learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for extracting features at three different scales. We then propose a refinement method to enhance the spatial coherence of our saliency results. Finally, aggregating multiple saliency maps computed for different levels of image segmentation can further boost the performance, yielding saliency maps better than those generated from a single segmentation.

"Conditional Random Rields (CRF) have been widely applied in image segmentations. While most studies rely on hand-crafted features, we here propose to exploit a pre-trained large convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate deep features for CRF learning. The deep CNN is trained on the ImageNet dataset and transferred to image segmentations here for constructing potentials of superpixels. Then the CRF parameters are learnt using a structured support vector machine (SSVM). To fully exploit context information in inference, we construct spatially related co-occurrence pairwise potentials and incorporate them into the energy function. This prefers labelling of object pairs that frequently co-occur in a certain spatial layout and at the same time avoids implausible labellings during the inference. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the promise of the proposed method. We thus provide new baselines for the segmentation performance on the Weizmann horse, Graz-02, MSRC-21, Stanford Background and PASCAL VOC 2011 datasets.",0

"Many machine learning tasks can be formulated in terms of predicting structured outputs. In frameworks such as the structured support vector machine (SVM-Struct) and the structured perceptron, discriminative functions are learned by iteratively applying efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding. However, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of probabilistic models over these same structured spaces requires computing partition functions, which is generally intractable. This paper presents a method for learning discrete exponential family models using the Bethe approximation to the MLE. Remarkably, this problem also reduces to iterative (MAP) decoding. This connection emerges by combining the Bethe approximation with a Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm on a convex dual objective which circumvents the intractable partition function. The result is a new single loop algorithm MLE-Struct, which is substantially more efficient than previous double-loop methods for approximate maximum likelihood estimation. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods in experiments involving image segmentation, matching problems from vision, and a new dataset of university roommate assignments.",0

"We consider the problem of approximate Bayesian inference in log-supermodular models. These models encompass regular pairwise MRFs with binary variables, but allow to capture high-order interactions, which are intractable for existing approximate inference techniques such as belief propagation, mean field, and variants.

This insight allows to leverage powerful existing tools, and hence to solve the variational problem orders of magnitude more efficiently than previously possible. We then provide another natural interpretation of L-FIELD, demonstrating that it exactly minimizes a specific type of R\'enyi divergence measure. This insight sheds light on the nature of the variational approximations produced by L-FIELD. Furthermore, we show how to perform parallel inference as message passing in a suitable factor graph at a linear convergence rate, without having to sum up over all the configurations of the factor.

Bi-level or multi-level thresholding of images is frequently achieved through the utilization of the maximum entropy principle. There are several techniques available that rely on Shannon and Tsallis entropies. This article examines these techniques and introduces a new approach that employs Kaniadakis entropy.,1
"In this paper we are proposing the use of Kaniadakis entropy in the bi-level thresholding of images, in the framework of a maximum entropy principle. We discuss the role of its entropic index in determining the threshold and in driving an ""image transition"", that is, an abrupt transition in the appearance of the corresponding bi-level image.

Several illustrations are provided to demonstrate the technique and to contrast it with the utilization of Tsallis entropy.",1
"The maximum entropy principle is largely used in thresholding and segmentation of images. Among the several formulations of this principle, the most effectively applied is that based on Tsallis non-extensive entropy. Here, we discuss the role of its entropic index in determining the thresholds. When this index is spanning the interval (0,1), for some images, the values of thresholds can have large leaps. In this manner, we observe abrupt transitions in the appearance of corresponding bi-level or multi-level images. These gray-level image transitions are analogous to order or texture transitions observed in physical systems, transitions which are driven by the temperature or by other physical quantities.",0
"Thresholding and segmentation of images commonly utilize the maximum entropy principle, with the most commonly used formulation being based on Tsallis non-extensive entropy.

"We propose an algorithm for separating the foreground (mainly text and line graphics) from the smoothly varying background in screen content images. The proposed method is designed based on the assumption that the background part of the image is smoothly varying and can be represented by a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis functions, while the foreground text and graphics create sharp discontinuity and cannot be modeled by this smooth representation. The algorithm separates the background and foreground using a least absolute deviation method to fit the smooth model to the image pixels. This algorithm has been tested on several images from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding, and is shown to have superior performance over other popular methods, such as k-means clustering based segmentation in DjVu and shape primitive extraction and coding (SPEC) algorithm. Such background/foreground segmentation are important pre-processing steps for text extraction and separate coding of background and foreground for compression of screen content images.",0

This algorithm has been extensively tested on various images from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding and has shown superior performance compared to other popular methods such as k-means clustering based segmentation in DjVu and shape primitive extraction and coding (SPEC) algorithm. This background/foreground segmentation is a crucial pre-processing step for text extraction and separate coding of background and foreground, which is essential for compressing screen content images.",1

"Broadly speaking, the objective in cardiac image segmentation is to delineate the outer and inner walls of the heart to segment out either the entire or parts of the organ boundaries. This paper will focus on MR images as they are the most widely used in cardiac segmentation -- as a result of the accurate morphological information and better soft tissue contrast they provide. This cardiac segmentation information is very useful as it eases physical measurements that provides useful metrics for cardiac diagnosis such as infracted volumes, ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, myocardial mass, cardiac movement, and the like. But, this task is difficult due to the intensity and texture similarities amongst the different cardiac and background structures on top of some noisy artifacts present in MR images. Thus far, various researchers have proposed different techniques to solve some of the pressing issues. This seminar paper presents an overview of representative medical image segmentation techniques. The paper also highlights preferred approaches for segmentation of the four cardiac chambers: the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA), on short axis image planes.",0

"This paper presents a novel selective constraint propagation method for constrained image segmentation. In the literature, many pairwise constraint propagation methods have been developed to exploit pairwise constraints for cluster analysis. However, since most of these methods have a polynomial time complexity, they are not much suitable for segmentation of images even with a moderate size, which is actually equivalent to cluster analysis with a large data size. Considering the local homogeneousness of a natural image, we choose to perform pairwise constraint propagation only over a selected subset of pixels, but not over the whole image. Such a selective constraint propagation problem is then solved by an efficient graph-based learning algorithm. To further speed up our selective constraint propagation, we also discard those less important propagated constraints during graph-based learning. Finally, the selectively propagated constraints are exploited based on $L_1$-minimization for normalized cuts over the whole image. The experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method for segmentation with selectively propagated constraints.",0

"This paper aims at developing an integrated system of clothing co-parsing, in order to jointly parse a set of clothing images (unsegmented but annotated with tags) into semantic configurations. We propose a data-driven framework consisting of two phases of inference. The first phase, referred as ""image co-segmentation"", iterates to extract consistent regions on images and jointly refines the regions over all images by employing the exemplar-SVM (E-SVM) technique [23]. In the second phase (i.e. ""region co-labeling""), we construct a multi-image graphical model by taking the segmented regions as vertices, and incorporate several contexts of clothing configuration (e.g., item location and mutual interactions). The joint label assignment can be solved using the efficient Graph Cuts algorithm. In addition to evaluate our framework on the Fashionista dataset [30], we construct a dataset called CCP consisting of 2098 high-resolution street fashion photos to demonstrate the performance of our system. We achieve 90.29% / 88.23% segmentation accuracy and 65.52% / 63.89% recognition rate on the Fashionista and the CCP datasets, respectively, which are superior compared with state-of-the-art methods.",0

"The figure-ground segmentation of humans in images captured in natural environments is an outstanding open problem due to the presence of complex backgrounds, articulation, varying body proportions, partial views and viewpoint changes. In this work we propose class-specific segmentation models that leverage parametric max-flow image segmentation and a large dataset of human shapes. Our contributions are as follows: (1) formulation of a sub-modular energy model that combines class-specific structural constraints and data-driven shape priors, within a parametric max-flow optimization methodology that systematically computes all breakpoints of the model in polynomial time; (2) design of a data-driven class-specific fusion methodology, based on matching against a large training set of exemplar human shapes (100,000 in our experiments), that allows the shape prior to be constructed on-the-fly, for arbitrary viewpoints and partial views. (3) demonstration of state of the art results, in two challenging datasets, H3D and MPII (where figure-ground segmentation annotations have been added by us), where we substantially improve on the first ranked hypothesis estimates of mid-level segmentation methods, by 20%, with hypothesis set sizes that are up to one order of magnitude smaller.",0

"Today Bayesian networks are more used in many areas of decision support and image processing. In this way, our proposed approach uses Bayesian Network to modelize the segmented image quality. This quality is calculated on a set of attributes that represent local evaluation measures. The idea is to have these local levels chosen in a way to be intersected into them to keep the overall appearance of segmentation. The approach operates in two phases: the first phase is to make an over-segmentation which gives superpixels card. In the second phase, we model the superpixels by a Bayesian Network. To find the segmented image with the best overall quality we used two approximate inference methods, the first using ICM algorithm which is widely used in Markov Models and a second is a recursive method called algorithm of model decomposition based on max-product algorithm which is very popular in the recent works of image segmentation. For our model, we have shown that the composition of these two algorithms leads to good segmentation performance.",0

"The segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a longstanding yet challenging task, not only because of the presence of speckle, but also due to the variations of surface backscattering properties in the images. Tremendous investigations have been made to eliminate the speckle effects for the segmentation of SAR images, while few work devotes to dealing with the variations of backscattering coefficients in the images. In order to overcome both the two difficulties, this paper presents a novel SAR image segmentation method by exploiting a multi-scale active contour model based on the non-local processing principle. More precisely, we first formulize the SAR segmentation problem with an active contour model by integrating the non-local interactions between pairs of patches inside and outside the segmented regions. Secondly, a multi-scale strategy is proposed to speed up the non-local active contour segmentation procedure and to avoid falling into local minimum for achieving more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on simulated and real SAR images demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method: it can not only achieve precise segmentations for images with heavy speckles and non-local intensity variations, but also can be used for SAR images from different types of sensors.",0

"Fingerprint recognition plays an important role in many commercial applications and is used by millions of people every day, e.g. for unlocking mobile phones. Fingerprint image segmentation is typically the first processing step of most fingerprint algorithms and it divides an image into foreground, the region of interest, and background. Two types of error can occur during this step which both have a negative impact on the recognition performance: 'true' foreground can be labeled as background and features like minutiae can be lost, or conversely 'true' background can be misclassified as foreground and spurious features can be introduced. The contribution of this paper is threefold: firstly, we propose a novel factorized directional bandpass (FDB) segmentation method for texture extraction based on the directional Hilbert transform of a Butterworth bandpass (DHBB) filter interwoven with soft-thresholding. Secondly, we provide a manually marked ground truth segmentation for 10560 images as an evaluation benchmark. Thirdly, we conduct a systematic performance comparison between the FDB method and four of the most often cited fingerprint segmentation algorithms showing that the FDB segmentation method clearly outperforms these four widely used methods. The benchmark and the implementation of the FDB method are made publicly available.",0

"A functional for joint variational object segmentation and shape matching is developed. The formulation is based on optimal transport w.r.t. geometric distance and local feature similarity. Geometric invariance and modelling of object-typical statistical variations is achieved by introducing degrees of freedom that describe transformations and deformations of the shape template. The shape model is mathematically equivalent to contour-based approaches but inference can be performed without conversion between the contour and region representations, allowing combination with other convex segmentation approaches and simplifying optimization. While the overall functional is non-convex, non-convexity is confined to a low-dimensional variable. We propose a locally optimal alternating optimization scheme and a globally optimal branch and bound scheme, based on adaptive convex relaxation. Combining both methods allows to eliminate the delicate initialization problem inherent to many contour based approaches while remaining computationally practical. The properties of the functional, its ability to adapt to a wide range of input data structures and the different optimization schemes are illustrated and compared by numerical experiments.",0

"We present highly efficient algorithms for performing forward and backward propagation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for pixelwise classification on images. For pixelwise classification tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection, surrounding image patches are fed into CNN for predicting the classes of centered pixels via forward propagation and for updating CNN parameters via backward propagation. However, forward and backward propagation was originally designed for whole-image classification. Directly applying it to pixelwise classification in a patch-by-patch scanning manner is extremely inefficient, because surrounding patches of pixels have large overlaps, which lead to a lot of redundant computation.   The proposed algorithms eliminate all the redundant computation in convolution and pooling on images by introducing novel d-regularly sparse kernels. It generates exactly the same results as those by patch-by-patch scanning. Convolution and pooling operations with such kernels are able to continuously access memory and can run efficiently on GPUs. A fraction of patches of interest can be chosen from each training image for backward propagation by applying a mask to the error map at the last CNN layer. Its computation complexity is constant with respect to the number of patches sampled from the image. Experiments have shown that our proposed algorithms speed up commonly used patch-by-patch scanning over 1500 times in both forward and backward propagation. The speedup increases with the sizes of images and patches.",0

"Algorithms based on spectral graph cut objectives such as normalized cuts, ratio cuts and ratio association have become popular in recent years because they are widely applicable and simple to implement via standard eigenvector computations. Despite strong performance for a number of clustering tasks, spectral graph cut algorithms still suffer from several limitations: first, they require the number of clusters to be known in advance, but this information is often unknown a priori; second, they tend to produce clusters with uniform sizes. In some cases, the true clusters exhibit a known size distribution; in image segmentation, for instance, human-segmented images tend to yield segment sizes that follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we propose a general framework of power-law graph cut algorithms that produce clusters whose sizes are power-law distributed, and also does not fix the number of clusters upfront. To achieve our goals, we treat the Pitman-Yor exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) as a regularizer to graph cut objectives. Because the resulting objectives cannot be solved by relaxing via eigenvectors, we derive a simple iterative algorithm to locally optimize the objectives. Moreover, we show that our proposed algorithm can be viewed as performing MAP inference on a particular Pitman-Yor mixture model. Our experiments on various data sets show the effectiveness of our algorithms.",0

We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains realtime performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset.

"Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are amongst the best performing models for structured computer vision tasks, such as semantic image segmentation or human pose estimation. Training SSVMs, however, is computationally costly, because it requires repeated calls to a structured prediction subroutine (called \emph{max-oracle}), which has to solve an optimization problem itself, e.g. a graph cut.   In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for SSVM training that is more efficient than earlier techniques when the max-oracle is computationally expensive, as it is frequently the case in computer vision tasks. The main idea is to (i) combine the recent stochastic Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm with efficient hyperplane caching, and (ii) use an automatic selection rule for deciding whether to call the exact max-oracle or to rely on an approximate one based on the cached hyperplanes.   We show experimentally that this strategy leads to faster convergence to the optimum with respect to the number of requires oracle calls, and that this translates into faster convergence with respect to the total runtime when the max-oracle is slow compared to the other steps of the algorithm.

"In this paper, we propose a fast fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for crowd segmentation. By replacing the fully connected layers in CNN with 1 by 1 convolution kernels, FCNN takes whole images as inputs and directly outputs segmentation maps by one pass of forward propagation. It has the property of translation invariance like patch-by-patch scanning but with much lower computation cost. Once FCNN is learned, it can process input images of any sizes without warping them to a standard size. These attractive properties make it extendable to other general image segmentation problems. Based on FCNN, a multi-stage deep learning is proposed to integrate appearance and motion cues for crowd segmentation. Both appearance filters and motion filers are pretrained stage-by-stage and then jointly optimized. Different combination methods are investigated.

"Salient object detection has been attracting a lot of interest, and recently various heuristic computational models have been designed. In this paper, we formulate saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, utilizes the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score. Saliency scores across multiple levels are finally fused to produce the saliency map. The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we propose a discriminate regional feature integration approach for salient object detection. Compared with existing heuristic models, our proposed method is able to automatically integrate high-dimensional regional saliency features and choose discriminative ones. The other is that by investigating standard generic region properties as well as two widely studied concepts for salient object detection, i.e., regional contrast and backgroundness, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our method runs as fast as most existing algorithms.",0

"Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both machine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of person re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same identity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the probe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person. However, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this assumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person re-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and identification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the probe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine which person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We present a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras, with 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop a benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person re-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for person re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline performance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is still largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",0
"Currently, person re-identification is a trending research topic for machine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications.

"Automatic face recognition has received significant performance improvement by developing specialised facial image representations. On the other hand, generic object recognition has rarely been applied to the face recognition. Spatial pyramid pooling of features encoded by an over-complete dictionary has been the key component of many state-of-the-art image classification systems. Inspired by its success, in this work we develop a new face image representation method inspired by the second-order pooling in Carreira et al. [1], which was originally proposed for image segmentation. The proposed method differs from the previous methods in that, we encode the densely extracted local patches by a small-size dictionary; and the facial image signatures are obtained by pooling the second-order statistics of the encoded features. We show the importance of pooling on encoded features, which is bypassed by the original second-order pooling method to avoid the high computational cost. Equipped with a simple linear classifier, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art face identification performance by large margins. For example, on the LFW databases, the proposed method performs better than the previous best by around 13% accuracy.",0

In a special section on metric and simulations, a new metric based on the comparison between the classical and quantum versions algorithms for edge detection of images is presented. Notable differences between the results of classical and quantum versions of such algorithms (outside and inside of quantum computer, respectively) show the existence of implementation problems involved in the experiment, and that they have not been properly modeled for optical environments.

"Accurate delineation of pathological lungs from computed tomography (CT) images remains mostly unsolved because available methods fail to provide a reliable generic solution due to high variability of abnormality appearance. Local descriptor-based classification methods have shown to work well in annotating pathologies; however, these methods are usually computationally intensive which restricts their widespread use in real-time or near-real-time clinical applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for fast, accurate, reliable segmentation of pathological lungs from CT scans by combining region-based segmentation method with local descriptor classification that is performed on an optimized sampling grid. Our method works in two stages; during stage one, we adapted the fuzzy connectedness (FC) image segmentation algorithm to perform initial lung parenchyma extraction.

"Biofilm is a formation of microbial material on tooth substrata. Several methods to quantify dental biofilm coverage have recently been reported in the literature, but at best they provide a semi-automated approach to quantification with significant input from a human grader that comes with the graders bias of what are foreground, background, biofilm, and tooth. Additionally, human assessment indices limit the resolution of the quantification scale; most commercial scales use five levels of quantification for biofilm coverage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). On the other hand, current state-of-the-art techniques in automatic plaque quantification fail to make their way into practical applications owing to their inability to incorporate human input to handle misclassifications. This paper proposes a new interactive method for biofilm quantification in Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images of canine teeth that is independent of the perceptual bias of the grader. The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and intensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a realization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters are estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes (background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data. The quantification results show a high degree of consistency and precision. At the same time, the proposed method gives pathologists full control to post-process the automatic quantification by flipping misclassified superpixels to a different state (background, tooth, biofilm) with a single click, providing greater usability than simply marking the boundaries of biofilm and tooth as done by current state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in image processing. It consist in classify the pixels into two or more groups depending on their intensity levels and a threshold value. The quality of the segmentation depends on the method applied to select the threshold. The use of the classical implementations for multilevel thresholding is computationally expensive since they exhaustively search the best values to optimize the objective function. Under such conditions, the use of optimization evolutionary approaches has been extended. The Electromagnetism Like algorithm (EMO) is an evolutionary method which mimics the attraction repulsion mechanism among charges to evolve the members of a population. Different to other algorithms, EMO exhibits interesting search capabilities whereas maintains a low computational overhead. In this paper, a multilevel thresholding (MT) algorithm based on the EMO is introduced. The approach combines the good search capabilities of EMO algorithm with objective functions proposed by the popular MT methods of Otsu and Kapur. The algorithm takes random samples from a feasible search space inside the image histogram. Such samples build each particle in the EMO context whereas its quality is evaluated considering the objective that is function employed by the Otsu or Kapur method. Guided by these objective values the set of candidate solutions are evolved through the EMO operators until an optimal solution is found.

"Recent progress in computational photography has shown that we can acquire near-infrared (NIR) information in addition to the normal visible (RGB) band, with only slight modifications to standard digital cameras. Due to the proximity of the NIR band to visible radiation, NIR images share many properties with visible images. However, as a result of the material dependent reflection in the NIR part of the spectrum, such images reveal different characteristics of the scene. We investigate how to effectively exploit these differences to improve performance on the semantic image segmentation task. Based on a state-of-the-art segmentation framework and a novel manually segmented image database (both indoor and outdoor scenes) that contain 4-channel images (RGB+NIR), we study how to best incorporate the specific characteristics of the NIR response.

Despite other techniques commonly seek through the parameter map, LA explores in the probability space providing appropriate convergence properties and robustness. The segmentation task is therefore considered as an optimization problem and the LA is used to generate the image multi-threshold separation. In this approach, one 1D histogram of a given image is approximated through a Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are calculated using the LA algorithm. Each Gaussian function approximating the histogram represents a pixel class and therefore a threshold point. The method shows fast convergence avoiding the typical sensitivity to initial conditions such as the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm or the complex time-consuming computations commonly found in gradient methods. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm ability to perform automatic multi-threshold selection and show interesting advantages as it is compared to other algorithms solving the same task.",0

"We present LS-CRF, a new method for very efficient large-scale training of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). It is inspired by existing closed-form expressions for the maximum likelihood parameters of a generative graphical model with tree topology. LS-CRF training requires only solving a set of independent regression problems, for which closed-form expression as well as efficient iterative solvers are available. This makes it orders of magnitude faster than conventional maximum likelihood learning for CRFs that require repeated runs of probabilistic inference. At the same time, the models learned by our method still allow for joint inference at test time. We apply LS-CRF to the task of semantic image segmentation, showing that it is highly efficient, even for loopy models where probabilistic inference is problematic. It allows the training of image segmentation models from significantly larger training sets than had been used previously. We demonstrate this on two new datasets that form a second contribution of this paper. They consist of over 180,000 images with figure-ground segmentation annotations.

"A large number of problems in computer vision can be modelled as energy minimization problems in a Markov Random Field (MRF) or Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. Graph-cuts based $\alpha$-expansion is a standard move-making method to minimize the energy functions with sub-modular pairwise terms. However, certain problems require more complex pairwise terms where the $\alpha$-expansion method is generally not applicable.   In this paper, we propose an iterative {\em tiered move making algorithm} which is able to handle general pairwise terms.

"Bio-image analysis is challenging due to inhomogeneous intensity distributions and high levels of noise in the images. Bayesian inference provides a principled way for regularizing the problem using prior knowledge. A fundamental choice is how one measures ""distances"" between shapes in an image. It has been shown that the straightforward geometric L2 distance is degenerate and leads to pathological situations. This is avoided when using Sobolev gradients, rendering the segmentation problem less ill-posed. The high computational cost and implementation overhead of Sobolev gradients, however, have hampered practical applications. We show how particle methods as applied to image segmentation allow for a simple and computationally efficient implementation of Sobolev gradients. We show that the evaluation of Sobolev gradients amounts to particle-particle interactions along the contour in an image. We extend an existing particle-based segmentation algorithm to using Sobolev gradients. Using synthetic and real-world images, we benchmark the results for both 2D and 3D images using piecewise smooth and piecewise constant region models. The present particle approximation of Sobolev gradients is 2.8 to 10 times faster than the previous reference implementation, but retains the known favorable properties of Sobolev gradients. This speedup is achieved by using local particle-particle interactions instead of solving a global Poisson equation at each iteration. The computational time per iteration is higher for Sobolev gradients than for L2 gradients. Since Sobolev gradients precondition the optimization problem, however, a smaller number of overall iterations may be necessary for the algorithm to converge, which can in some cases amortize the higher per-iteration cost.",0

"Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It unifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance of using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely realized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual hierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical framework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is trained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our model then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This training strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at multiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is purely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments or shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as object segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms state-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets.

"We develop a generalized active contour formalism for image segmentation based on shape templates.

The active contour energy is a contrast function defined based on the intensities of pixels that lie inside the inner contour and those that lie in the annulus between the inner and outer contours. We show that the contrast energy functional is optimal under certain conditions. The optimal RAT parameters are computed by maximizing the contrast function using a gradient descent optimizer. We show that the calculations are made efficient through use of Green's theorem.

The proposed method is shown to be optimal under certain conditions, with the optimal RAT parameters obtained via gradient descent optimization. The use of Green's theorem enables efficient computation, and the approach is capable of handling various shapes through optimization of RAT parameters based on a chosen template. The method is validated for robustness to noise, initialization, and partial loss of object structure across multiple images.",1
"Recently, it has become evident that submodularity naturally captures widely occurring concepts in machine learning, signal processing and computer vision. Consequently, there is need for efficient optimization procedures for submodular functions, especially for minimization problems. While general submodular minimization is challenging, we propose a new method that exploits existing decomposability of submodular functions. In contrast to previous approaches, our method is neither approximate, nor impractical, nor does it need any cumbersome parameter tuning. Moreover, it is easy to implement and parallelize. A key component of our method is a formulation of the discrete submodular minimization problem as a continuous best approximation problem that is solved through a sequence of reflections, and its solution can be easily thresholded to obtain an optimal discrete solution. This method solves both the continuous and discrete formulations of the problem, and therefore has applications in learning, inference, and reconstruction. In our experiments, we illustrate the benefits of our method on two image segmentation tasks.",0

"Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different regions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or shape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object segmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves in order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired object boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that produce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector fields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In this paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued images. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values in the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale images, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images. As another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture segmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold valued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images and texture images.",0

"Energy minimization algorithms, such as graph cuts, enable the computation of the MAP solution under certain probabilistic models such as Markov random fields. However, for many computer vision problems, the MAP solution under the model is not the ground truth solution. In many problem scenarios, the system has access to certain statistics of the ground truth. For instance, in image segmentation, the area and boundary length of the object may be known. In these cases, we want to estimate the most probable solution that is consistent with such statistics, i.e., satisfies certain equality or inequality constraints.   The above constrained energy minimization problem is NP-hard in general, and is usually solved using Linear Programming formulations, which relax the integrality constraints. This paper proposes a novel method that finds the discrete optimal solution of such problems by maximizing the corresponding Lagrangian dual. This method can be applied to any constrained energy minimization problem whose unconstrained version is polynomial time solvable, and can handle multiple, equality or inequality, and linear or non-linear constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the foreground/background image segmentation problem, and show that it produces impressive segmentation results with less error, and runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art LP relaxation based approaches.",0

"Image segmentation is a crucial step in a wide range of method image processing systems. It is useful in visualization of the different objects present in the image. In spite of the several methods available in the literature, image segmentation still a challenging problem in most of image processing applications. The challenge comes from the fuzziness of image objects and the overlapping of the different regions. Detection of edges in an image is a very important step towards understanding image features. There are large numbers of edge detection operators available, each designed to be sensitive to certain types of edges. The Quality of edge detection can be measured from several criteria objectively. Some criteria are proposed in terms of mathematical measurement, some of them are based on application and implementation requirements. Since edges often occur at image locations representing object boundaries, edge detection is extensively used in image segmentation when images are divided into areas corresponding to different objects. This can be used specifically for enhancing the tumor area in mammographic images. Different methods are available for edge detection like Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Log edge operators. In this paper a novel algorithms for edge detection has been proposed for mammographic images. Breast boundary, pectoral region and tumor location can be seen clearly by using this method.

"In this paper, we study statistical classification accuracy of two different Markov field environments for pixelwise image segmentation, considering the labels of the image as hidden states and solving the estimation of such labels as a solution of the MAP equation. The emission distribution is assumed the same in all models, and the difference lays in the Markovian prior hypothesis made over the labeling random field. The a priori labeling knowledge will be modeled with a) a second order anisotropic Markov Mesh and b) a classical isotropic Potts model. Under such models, we will consider three different segmentation procedures, 2D Path Constrained Viterbi training for the Hidden Markov Mesh, a Graph Cut based segmentation for the first order isotropic Potts model, and ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes) for the second order isotropic Potts model.

"This report describes the design, implementation, evaluation and original enhancements to the Live-Wire method for 2D and 3D image segmentation. Live-Wire 2D employs a semi-automatic paradigm; the user is asked to select a few boundary points of the object to segment, to steer the process in the right direction, while the result is displayed in real time. In our implementation segmentation is extended to three dimensions by performing this process on a slice-by-slice basis. User's time and involvement is further reduced by allowing him to specify object contours in planes orthogonal to the slices. If these planes are chosen strategically, Live-Wire 3D can perform 2D segmentation in the plane of each slice automatically. This report also proposes two improvements to the original method, path heating and a new graph edge feature function based on variance of path properties along the boundary. We show that these improvements lead up to a 33% reduction in interaction with the user, and improved delineation in presence of strong interfering edges.",0

"A novel locally statistical active contour model (ACM) for image segmentation in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity is presented in this paper. The inhomogeneous objects are modeled as Gaussian distributions of different means and variances, and a moving window is used to map the original image into another domain, where the intensity distributions of inhomogeneous objects are still Gaussian but are better separated. The means of the Gaussian distributions in the transformed domain can be adaptively estimated by multiplying a bias field with the original signal within the window. A statistical energy functional is then defined for each local region, which combines the bias field, the level set function, and the constant approximating the true signal of the corresponding object.

"We present a novel segmentation algorithm based on a hierarchical representation of images. The main contribution of this work is to explore the capabilities of the A Contrario reasoning when applied to the segmentation problem, and to overcome the limitations of current algorithms within that framework. This exploratory approach has three main goals.   Our first goal is to extend the search space of greedy merging algorithms to the set of all partitions spanned by a certain hierarchy, and to cast the segmentation as a selection problem within this space. In this way we increase the number of tested partitions and thus we potentially improve the segmentation results. In addition, this space is considerably smaller than the space of all possible partitions, thus we still keep the complexity controlled.   Our second goal aims to improve the locality of region merging algorithms, which usually merge pairs of neighboring regions. In this work, we overcome this limitation by introducing a validation procedure for complete partitions, rather than for pairs of regions.   The third goal is to perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation methodology in order to provide reproducible results.   Finally, we embed the selection process on a statistical A Contrario framework which allows us to have only one free parameter related to the desired scale.",0

"In photography, low depth of field (DOF) is an important technique to emphasize the object of interest (OOI) within an image. Thus, low DOF images are widely used in the application area of macro, portrait or sports photography.

Thus, a robust algorithm for the fully automatic detection of the OOI in low DOF images provides valuable information for subsequent image processing and image retrieval. In this paper we propose a robust and parameterless algorithm for the fully automatic segmentation of low DOF images.

"""Background subtraction"" is an old technique for finding moving objects in a video sequence for example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image from a timeaveraged background image will leave only nonstationary objects. It is, however, a crude approximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel using an unsupervised technique- an efficient, incremental version of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Application of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.",0
"The conventional method of ""background subtraction"" is a dated technique for detecting mobile objects in a video sequence, such as cars traveling on a freeway. The approach involves subtracting the current image from a background image averaged over time to isolate non-stationary objects. However, this technique is an oversimplification of the task of categorizing each pixel of the current image. It is ineffective when dealing with slow-moving objects and cannot differentiate between shadows and moving objects. The central concept of this research is to use a classification model for each pixel based on how it appears when part of different classes. We employ an unsupervised technique, an efficient, incremental version of EM, to learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel. Unlike the typical image-averaging method, our approach automatically updates the mixture component for each class based on the likelihood of membership, which makes it ideal for handling slow-moving objects. Furthermore, our approach is more effective when it comes to identifying and eliminating shadows compared to other techniques such as thresholding. We anticipate that implementing this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project will significantly enhance vehicle identification and tracking.",1
"Image thresholding has played an important role in image segmentation. This paper presents a hybrid approach for image segmentation based on the thresholding by fuzzy c-means (THFCM) algorithm for image segmentation. The goal of the proposed approach is to find a discerner cluster able to find an automatic threshold. The algorithm is formulated by applying the standard FCM clustering algorithm to the frequencies (y-values) on the smoothed histogram. Hence, the frequencies of an image can be used instead of the conventional whole data of image. The cluster that has the highest peak which represents the maximum frequency in the image histogram will play as an excellent role in determining a discerner cluster to the grey level image. Then, the pixels belong to the discerner cluster represent an object in the gray level histogram while the other clusters represent a background. Experimental results with standard test images have been obtained through the proposed approach (THFCM).",0
"The use of image thresholding has been significant in the process of image segmentation. This paper introduces a novel technique for image segmentation, which combines the thresholding approach with the fuzzy c-means (THFCM) algorithm.

To achieve this, the standard FCM clustering algorithm is applied to the smoothed histogram's frequencies. Instead of using the entire image data, the frequency distribution of the image is utilized. The cluster with the highest peak in the histogram is identified as the discerner cluster, which helps in determining the object in the gray level histogram. The remaining clusters represent the background. The effectiveness of the proposed approach (THFCM) has been validated through experiments conducted on standard test images.",1
"A framework of M-estimation based fuzzy C-means clustering (MFCM) algorithm is proposed with iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, and penalty constraint and kernelization extensions of MFCM algorithms are also developed.

"The incidence of thyroid nodule is very high and generally increases with the age. Thyroid nodule may presage the emergence of thyroid cancer. The thyroid nodule can be completely cured if detected early. Fine needle aspiration cytology is a recognized early diagnosis method of thyroid nodule. There are still some limitations in the fine needle aspiration cytology, and the ultrasound diagnosis of thyroid nodule has become the first choice for auxiliary examination of thyroid nodular disease. If we could combine medical imaging technology and fine needle aspiration cytology, the diagnostic rate of thyroid nodule would be improved significantly. The properties of ultrasound will degrade the image quality, which makes it difficult to recognize the edges for physicians. Image segmentation technique based on graph theory has become a research hotspot at present. Normalized cut (Ncut) is a representative one, which is suitable for segmentation of feature parts of medical image. However, how to solve the normalized cut has become a problem, which needs large memory capacity and heavy calculation of weight matrix. It always generates over segmentation or less segmentation which leads to inaccurate in the segmentation. The speckle noise in B ultrasound image of thyroid tumor makes the quality of the image deteriorate. In the light of this characteristic, we combine the anisotropic diffusion model with the normalized cut in this paper. After the enhancement of anisotropic diffusion model, it removes the noise in the B ultrasound image while preserves the important edges and local details. This reduces the amount of computation in constructing the weight matrix of the improved normalized cut and improves the accuracy of the final segmentation results. The feasibility of the method is proved by the experimental results.",0

"Most state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class image segmentation and labeling use conditional random fields defined over pixels or image regions. While region-level models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy.",0
