"Humans achieve efficient learning by relying on prior knowledge about the structure of naturally occurring tasks. There is considerable interest in designing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with similar properties. This includes proposals to learn the learning algorithm itself, an idea also known as meta learning. One formal interpretation of this idea is as a partially observable multi-task RL problem in which task information is hidden from the agent. Such unknown task problems can be reduced to Markov decision processes (MDPs) by augmenting an agent's observations with an estimate of the belief about the task based on past experience. However estimating the belief state is intractable in most partially-observed MDPs. We propose a method that separately learns the policy and the task belief by taking advantage of various kinds of privileged information. Our approach can be very effective at solving standard meta-RL environments, as well as a complex continuous control environment with sparse rewards and requiring long-term memory.",0
"Reinforcement learning has been successfully used to solve many challenging problems. However, selecting an appropriate reward function remains one of the biggest obstacles in deploying RL algorithms in practice, especially on complex tasks with large state spaces. In recent years, meta reinforcement learning (meta RL) techniques have emerged as a promising approach that aim to learn a good reward function directly from raw input streams. This study presents a novel method called ""Task Inference"" that leverages deep neural networks to explicitly model both the RL problem and the environment dynamics during training. Our experiments demonstrate that Task Inference can effectively infer complex tasks such as Atari games using only screen pixels as input, without any prior knowledge about the game rules. Moreover, we show that our algorithm outperforms several baseline methods, including those based on self-play, inverse RL, and adversarial imitation learning. Our work paves the way towards solving real-world problems where explicit reward functions are difficult to design or even unknown.",1
"In this paper, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to obtain online power control policies for a large energy harvesting (EH) multiple access channel, when only causal information about the EH process and wireless channel is available. In the proposed framework, we model the online power control problem as a discrete-time mean-field game (MFG), and analytically show that the MFG has a unique stationary solution. Next, we leverage the fictitious play property of the mean-field games, and the deep reinforcement learning technique to learn the stationary solution of the game, in a completely distributed fashion. We analytically show that the proposed procedure converges to the unique stationary solution of the MFG. This, in turn, ensures that the optimal policies can be learned in a completely distributed fashion. In order to benchmark the performance of the distributed policies, we also develop a deep neural network (DNN) based centralized as well as distributed online power control schemes. Our simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed power control policies. In particular, the DNN based centralized power control policies provide a very good performance for large EH networks for which the design of optimal policies is intractable using the conventional methods such as Markov decision processes. Further, performance of both the distributed policies is close to the throughput achieved by the centralized policies.",0
"In the current age of technology and advancements in the field of energy harvesting networks, power control systems play a crucial role in ensuring optimal performance of these networks. With increasing demands on energy efficiency and sustainability, distributed power control schemes have emerged as promising approaches to efficiently utilize energy resources while reducing overall system costs. However, designing effective distributed power control strategies remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of large-scale energy harvesting networks. To address this challenge, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach that enables distributed agents to learn collaboratively from their individual interactions within the network environment. Our proposed method leverages recent developments in deep neural networks and game theory, allowing each agent to make decisions based on local observations and to cooperate effectively with other agents across different time scales. Through extensive simulations, our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized controllers by achieving significant improvements in terms of energy conversion efficiency and network stability while maintaining robustness against uncertainties and disturbances. This research work provides valuable insights into developing scalable and adaptive power management solutions for future large-scale energy harvesting networks, which hold great potential for real-world applications such as IoT sensor networks, renewable microgrids, and smart cities.",1
"Aiming to produce sufficient and diverse training samples, data augmentation has been demonstrated for its effectiveness in training deep models. Regarding that the criterion of the best augmentation is challenging to define, we in this paper present a novel learning-based augmentation method termed as DeepAugNet, which formulates the final augmented data as a collection of several sequentially augmented subsets. Specifically, the current augmented subset is required to maximize the performance improvement compared with the last augmented subset by learning the deterministic augmentation policy using deep reinforcement learning. By introducing an unified optimization goal, DeepAugNet intends to combine the data augmentation and the deep model training in an end-to-end training manner which is realized by simultaneously training a hybrid architecture of dueling deep Q-learning algorithm and a surrogate deep model. We extensively evaluated our proposed DeepAugNet on various benchmark datasets including Fashion MNIST, CUB, CIFAR-100 and WebCaricature. Compared with the current state-of-the-arts, our method can achieve a significant improvement in small-scale datasets, and a comparable performance in large-scale datasets. Code will be available soon.",0
"This paper describes automatic data augmentation through learning the deterministic policy of target models. As machine learning systems become more prevalent, so does the need for training datasets that can efficiently produce accurate models while using minimal resources. Current methods for generating additional training examples mostly involve applying random transformations which often results in overfitting and suboptimal performance on real world distributions. Our method addresses these issues by learning the deterministic policy of a given model. In order to learn this policy we first generate synthetic samples by iteratively applying a set of simple heuristics designed to capture the essence of the training distribution. We then train our auxiliary model (policy) on predicting which of two neighboring images came from the true training distribution. By minimizing cross entropy loss we effectively maximize the mutual information between the generated images and their corresponding labels. Finally we use the learned policy as a guide during inference time to sample new examples that share characteristics with real instances. Using three popular image classification benchmarks - CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and STL-10 - we show consistent improvement over standard random augmentation baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively without incurring any additional computational cost at test time. With the ease of implementation, scalability, and improved performance, our approach sets itself apart as a strong contender for state-of-the art automated data augmentation techniques.",1
"Urban autonomous driving decision making is challenging due to complex road geometry and multi-agent interactions. Current decision making methods are mostly manually designing the driving policy, which might result in sub-optimal solutions and is expensive to develop, generalize and maintain at scale. On the other hand, with reinforcement learning (RL), a policy can be learned and improved automatically without any manual designs. However, current RL methods generally do not work well on complex urban scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework to enable model-free deep reinforcement learning in challenging urban autonomous driving scenarios. We design a specific input representation and use visual encoding to capture the low-dimensional latent states. Several state-of-the-art model-free deep RL algorithms are implemented into our framework, with several tricks to improve their performance. We evaluate our method in a challenging roundabout task with dense surrounding vehicles in a high-definition driving simulator. The result shows that our method can solve the task well and is significantly better than the baseline.",0
"Recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have shown promising results in various domains, including autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches rely on handcrafted models of the environment which can limit their scalability and adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a model-free approach that uses only raw sensor inputs and rewards to learn policies for urban autonomous driving tasks without any prior knowledge of the environment. We utilize proximal policy optimization (PPO), a popular DRL algorithm known for its stability and sample efficiency, as our base algorithm. Our method shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple challenging benchmarks while requiring less computational resources. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our model-free approach in enabling agents to quickly learn complex behaviors from scratch without any environment assumptions.",1
"In this paper, we study reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to solve real-world decision problems with the objective of maximizing the long-term reward as well as satisfying cumulative constraints. We propose a novel first-order policy optimization method, Interior-point Policy Optimization (IPO), which augments the objective with logarithmic barrier functions, inspired by the interior-point method. Our proposed method is easy to implement with performance guarantees and can handle general types of cumulative multiconstraint settings. We conduct extensive evaluations to compare our approach with state-of-the-art baselines. Our algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms, in terms of reward maximization and constraint satisfaction.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing algorithms that can efficiently solve complex optimization problems subject to constraints. These constrained optimization problems arise frequently in a wide range of applications such as finance, engineering, computer science, and operations research. One popular method for solving these problems is interior-point policy optimization (IPO), which involves finding a solution that lies on the boundary of the feasible region defined by the constraints. This technique allows for efficient computation of solutions that satisfy all constraints while minimizing a cost function. Furthermore, IPO enjoys several desirable theoretical properties including global convergence and robustness to noise in the input data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing literature on IPO techniques and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We then propose new variations of IPO algorithms designed to address some of the shortcomings of traditional methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches compared to state-of-the-art methods from the literature. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future research in this area.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a booming area of artificial intelligence. Many practical applications of DRL naturally involve more than one collaborative learners, making it important to study DRL in a multi-agent context. Previous research showed that effective learning in complex multi-agent systems demands for highly coordinated environment exploration among all the participating agents. Many researchers attempted to cope with this challenge through learning centralized value functions. However, the common strategy for every agent to learn their local policies directly often fail to nurture strong inter-agent collaboration and can be sample inefficient whenever agents alter their communication channels. To address these issues, we propose a new framework known as centralized training and exploration with decentralized execution via policy distillation. Guided by this framework and the maximum-entropy learning technique, we will first train agents' policies with shared global component to foster coordinated and effective learning. Locally executable policies will be derived subsequently from the trained global policies via policy distillation. Experiments show that our new framework and algorithm can achieve significantly better performance and higher sample efficiency than a cutting-edge baseline on several multi-agent DRL benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as an important research area, addressing challenges in artificial intelligence such as coordination among agents, decision making under uncertainty, and strategic interaction. However, training MARL algorithms remains difficult due to computational intractability, partial observability, credit assignment problems, and non-stationarity issues arising from decentralized execution of learned policies. This work proposes a new framework that overcomes these limitations by leveraging centralized training and exploration while enabling decentralized execution via policy distillation. We demonstrate how our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains, including gridworld environments and continuous control tasks. Our results showcase the effectiveness of our method compared to existing solutions, highlighting the potential impact on advancing the field of MARL.",1
"While often stated as an instance of the likelihood ratio trick [Rubinstein, 1989], the original policy gradient theorem [Sutton, 1999] involves an integral over the action space. When this integral can be computed, the resulting ""all-action"" estimator [Sutton, 2001] provides a conditioning effect [Bratley, 1987] reducing the variance significantly compared to the REINFORCE estimator [Williams, 1992]. In this paper, we adopt a numerical integration perspective to broaden the applicability of the all-action estimator to general spaces and to any function class for the policy or critic components, beyond the Gaussian case considered by [Ciosek, 2018]. In addition, we provide a new theoretical result on the effect of using a biased critic which offers more guidance than the previous ""compatible features"" condition of [Sutton, 1999]. We demonstrate the benefit of our approach in continuous control tasks with nonlinear function approximation. Our results show improved performance and sample efficiency.",0
"Here we present numerical methods for obtaining policy gradients using action sampling from a deterministic model that predicts future states as if they were generated by the greedy policies of other agents. We demonstrate through computational examples that these methods can yield high accuracy gradient estimates and enable efficient optimization over continuous actions spaces. Our approach combines several ideas from prior work on approximate policy evaluation and gradient ascent but our focus here is specifically on the challenge of computing policy gradients given access only to samples obtained by querying an external model. As a main technical contribution, we introduce a new estimator based on importance sampling with shaped kernels that reweighs trajectory segments so that the likelihood ratio reflects the probabilities of observing each segment under the current versus a reference (baseline) policy; such baselines may improve performance but are typically harder to compute than reference models used in prior actor-critic algorithms. To reduce variance we further develop variants of the estimators based on ensembles, control variates and mini-batch averaging. Experiments in environments where multiple agents learn collaboratively showcase the efficiency advantages brought by our general framework which we believe should have broad appeal across many domains ranging from robotics and autonomous systems to game playing and decision making in large organizations. By decoupling the learning loop from execution we enable the use of complex models as guidance for finding good actions without requiring perfect knowledge of their properties nor exact alignment with the real system dynamics. While addressing limitations in scalability our methodology maintains state-of-the-art sample complexity guarantees under simple assumptions, thus setting up grounds for even more effective solutions amenable to larger problems with longer horizons or greater stochasticity.",1
"Slimmable networks are a family of neural networks that can instantly adjust the runtime width. The width can be chosen from a predefined widths set to adaptively optimize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to train universally slimmable networks (US-Nets), extending slimmable networks to execute at arbitrary width, and generalizing to networks both with and without batch normalization layers. We further propose two improved training techniques for US-Nets, named the sandwich rule and inplace distillation, to enhance training process and boost testing accuracy. We show improved performance of universally slimmable MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on ImageNet classification task, compared with individually trained ones and 4-switch slimmable network baselines. We also evaluate the proposed US-Nets and improved training techniques on tasks of image super-resolution and deep reinforcement learning. Extensive ablation experiments on these representative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Our discovery opens up the possibility to directly evaluate FLOPs-Accuracy spectrum of network architectures. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/JiahuiYu/slimmable_networks",0
"In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems in computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and other domains.

Overall, our work contributes to the development of efficient machine learning algorithms that can operate at scale, making them accessible to a wider range of applications.",1
"We propose and study a general framework for regularized Markov decision processes (MDPs) where the goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected discounted total reward plus a policy regularization term. The extant entropy-regularized MDPs can be cast into our framework. Moreover, under our framework, many regularization terms can bring multi-modality and sparsity, which are potentially useful in reinforcement learning. In particular, we present sufficient and necessary conditions that induce a sparse optimal policy. We also conduct a full mathematical analysis of the proposed regularized MDPs, including the optimality condition, performance error, and sparseness control. We provide a generic method to devise regularization forms and propose off-policy actor critic algorithms in complex environment settings. We empirically analyze the numerical properties of optimal policies and compare the performance of different sparse regularization forms in discrete and continuous environments.",0
"In this paper we introduce the regularization based sparse optimization framework called RASP (Regularized Approximate Solution Path) for learning optimal policies in reinforcement learning problems. We show that our method can efficiently solve large scale linear and nonlinear programming problems to high accuracy at significantly reduced computational times as compared to standard policy iteration methods like Value Iteration, Q-Learning, etc., thus enabling the search space dimension to increase by several orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art approaches while still providing a significant improvement in solution quality.",1
"Sequential decision making is a typical problem in reinforcement learning with plenty of algorithms to solve it. However, only a few of them can work effectively with a very small number of observations. In this report, we introduce the progress to learn the policy for Malaria Control as a Reinforcement Learning problem in the KDD Cup Challenge 2019 and propose diverse solutions to deal with the limited observations problem. We apply the Genetic Algorithm, Bayesian Optimization, Q-learning with sequence breaking to find the optimal policy for five years in a row with only 20 episodes/100 evaluations. We evaluate those algorithms and compare their performance with Random Search as a baseline. Among these algorithms, Q-Learning with sequence breaking has been submitted to the challenge and got ranked 7th in KDD Cup.",0
"Effective policy making for infectious disease control requires integrating diverse information sources into policymakers’ decisions. However, existing decision support systems typically provide only one method for addressing the many questions that must be considered by malaria control programs. This study proposes using machine learning algorithms on real world data from multiple countries to create tailored decision trees which may improve malaria prevention programming at national scale. We train models across four different outcome variables: (a) Anopheles mortality rate; (b) Incidence of P. falciparum clinical malaria cases per person population exposure; (c) Proportion of children aged <5 years with detectable parasitaemia prevalence; and d) Proportion of RDT positivity amongst suspected case testing in health facilities. Findings indicate moderate predictability of all outcomes in the full model with better performance among subsets of low transmission countries. Despite limitations due to the quality and availability of data, we argue that these findings demonstrate potential gains through improved statistical methods providing context specific recommendations for malaria programme managers as opposed to relying exclusively on expert opinion and general guidelines. With further improvements on both data collection and modelling, future iterations have the potential to inform more complex questions related to resource allocation such as targeted vector control strategies where geographic heterogeneity could lead to differential intervention effectiveness and cost.",1
"In this work, we explore how a strategic selection of camera movements can facilitate the task of 6D multi-object pose estimation in cluttered scenarios while respecting real-world constraints important in robotics and augmented reality applications, such as time and distance traveled. In the proposed framework, a set of multiple object hypotheses is given to an agent, which is inferred by an object pose estimator and subsequently spatio-temporally selected by a fusion function that makes use of a verification score that circumvents the need of ground-truth annotations. The agent reasons about these hypotheses, directing its attention to the object which it is most uncertain about, moving the camera towards such an object. Unlike previous works that propose short-sighted policies, our agent is trained in simulated scenarios using reinforcement learning, attempting to learn the camera moves that produce the most accurate object poses hypotheses for a given temporal and spatial budget, without the need of viewpoints rendering during inference. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully estimates the 6D object pose of a stack of objects in both challenging cluttered synthetic and real scenarios, showing superior performance compared to strong baselines.",0
"This research presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for active 6D multi-object pose estimation in cluttered scenarios. Accurate object localization is essential for many computer vision applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. Existing methods often struggle to estimate poses in challenging environments where objects overlap and occlude each other. Our method uses a deep neural network trained with reinforcement learning to select effective viewpoints that maximize mutual information between sensor measurements and true object poses while minimizing collision risk. We demonstrate significant improvements over baseline approaches on several publicly available datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance under difficult conditions. These results highlight the potential of active perception techniques driven by machine learning to solve complex sensing problems in real-world settings.",1
"Effective coordination is crucial to solve multi-agent collaborative (MAC) problems. While centralized reinforcement learning methods can optimally solve small MAC instances, they do not scale to large problems and they fail to generalize to scenarios different from those seen during training. In this paper, we consider MAC problems with some intrinsic notion of locality (e.g., geographic proximity) such that interactions between agents and tasks are locally limited. By leveraging this property, we introduce a novel structured prediction approach to assign agents to tasks. At each step, the assignment is obtained by solving a centralized optimization problem (the inference procedure) whose objective function is parameterized by a learned scoring model. We propose different combinations of inference procedures and scoring models able to represent coordination patterns of increasing complexity. The resulting assignment policy can be efficiently learned on small problem instances and readily reused in problems with more agents and tasks (i.e., zero-shot generalization). We report experimental results on a toy search and rescue problem and on several target selection scenarios in StarCraft: Brood War, in which our model significantly outperforms strong rule-based baselines on instances with 5 times more agents and tasks than those seen during training.",0
"In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents work together towards achieving common goals while optimizing individual rewards. However, most existing MARL algorithms focus on solving single tasks without considering generalization across multiple tasks. This can lead to poor performance when faced with new environments that differ from previous training experiences. To address this challenge, we propose a structured prediction approach for multi-task cooperative MARL based on generalized policy learning (GMPL) that enables efficient knowledge transfer among different tasks. Our method involves three key components: task decomposition, predictive distribution learning, and adaptive joint policy optimization. We first decompose each task into smaller subtasks and learn shared policies that optimize cross-entropy objectives. Then, we use Bayesian deep neural networks to model distributions over predictions and actions, enabling uncertainty quantification and safe exploration. Finally, we develop an online algorithm to update policies incrementally by minimizing Kullback–Leibler divergence between old and new beliefs. Through extensive experiments using popular benchmark domains such as StarCraft II and MiniGrid, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves significant improvements in both sample efficiency and overall task completion rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GMPL generates interpretable beliefs and explanations about the environment dynamics, highlighting its potential applications in real-world scenarios where transparency is critical. Overall, our work represents a novel perspective on hierarchical decision making in dynamic environments, emphasizing how structured probabilistic models can drive effective collaboration among autonomous agents and advance their ability to learn in complex situations.",1
"Deep learning is attracting significant interest in the neuroimaging community as a means to diagnose psychiatric and neurological disorders from structural magnetic resonance images. However, there is a tendency amongst researchers to adopt architectures optimized for traditional computer vision tasks, rather than design networks customized for neuroimaging data. We address this by introducing NEURO-DRAM, a 3D recurrent visual attention model tailored for neuroimaging classification. The model comprises an agent which, trained by reinforcement learning, learns to navigate through volumetric images, selectively attending to the most informative regions for a given task. When applied to Alzheimer's disease prediction, NEURODRAM achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy on an out-of-sample dataset, significantly outperforming a baseline convolutional neural network. When further applied to the task of predicting which patients with mild cognitive impairment will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease within two years, the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with no additional training. Encouragingly, the agent learns, without explicit instruction, a search policy in agreement with standardized radiological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a route to automated biomarker discovery for more poorly understood disorders.",0
"In recent years, deep learning methods have gained popularity as promising approaches for medical image analysis problems, such as predicting treatment response from neuroimaging data. Despite their impressive performance on challenging tasks like lesion detection, most of these models lack interpretability - their internal workings remain opaque to human observers. This hinders adoption by clinicians who require explicit rationales behind diagnostic decisions based on quantitative imaging results. To overcome this limitation, we propose Neuro-Dram (Neural Network with Object Rational Attention Model), a novel recurrent 3D convolutional architecture that learns explainable attentional maps over input images directly correlating with diagnostic features relevant to the problem at hand. We validate our approach on three diverse datasets involving multiple types of neurological disorders in which radiologists rely on specific neuroanatomical regions for diagnosis. Our experiments show that Neuro-Dram achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art non-interpretable architectures while providing insights into the underlying reasoning process through object-level regional explanations. These findings lay the foundation for transparent neural network interpretation that can foster trust among end users for improved patient care via personalized medicine strategies.

"Reinforcement learning, mathematically described by Markov Decision Problems, may be approached either through dynamic programming or policy search. Actor-critic algorithms combine the merits of both approaches by alternating between steps to estimate the value function and policy gradient updates. Due to the fact that the updates exhibit correlated noise and biased gradient updates, only the asymptotic behavior of actor-critic is known by connecting its behavior to dynamical systems. This work puts forth a new variant of actor-critic that employs Monte Carlo rollouts during the policy search updates, which results in controllable bias that depends on the number of critic evaluations. As a result, we are able to provide for the first time the convergence rate of actor-critic algorithms when the policy search step employs policy gradient, agnostic to the choice of policy evaluation technique. In particular, we establish conditions under which the sample complexity is comparable to stochastic gradient method for non-convex problems or slower as a result of the critic estimation error, which is the main complexity bottleneck. These results hold for in continuous state and action spaces with linear function approximation for the value function. We then specialize these conceptual results to the case where the critic is estimated by Temporal Difference, Gradient Temporal Difference, and Accelerated Gradient Temporal Difference. These learning rates are then corroborated on a navigation problem involving an obstacle, which suggests that learning more slowly may lead to improved limit points, providing insight into the interplay between optimization and generalization in reinforcement learning.",0
"In recent years, actor-critic methods have gained popularity as efficient algorithms for solving reinforcement learning problems. However, the sample complexity of these methods has been largely unexplored. This paper investigates the sample efficiency of actor-critic algorithms that use function approximation, focusing on two commonly used architectures: deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC). We analyze the theoretical worst-case sample complexities for both DDPG and SAC under common assumptions and provide bounds on how many samples are required for convergence. Our results show that both algorithms exhibit comparable sample complexity and can achieve near-optimal policies with relatively few interactions with the environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that our analysis provides tight bounds for actual performance, validating the effectiveness of actor-critic methods in achieving high-quality solutions efficiently. Overall, our work highlights the promise of using function approximators in conjunction with actor-critic methods for solving challenging RL tasks and contributes towards better understanding their behavior.",1
"Soft Actor-Critic is a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous action settings that is not applicable to discrete action settings. Many important settings involve discrete actions, however, and so here we derive an alternative version of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm that is applicable to discrete action settings. We then show that, even without any hyperparameter tuning, it is competitive with the tuned model-free state-of-the-art on a selection of games from the Atari suite.",0

"Meta-learning has emerged as an important framework for learning new tasks from just a few examples. The success of any meta-learning model depends on (i) its fast adaptation to new tasks, as well as (ii) having a shared representation across similar tasks. Here we extend the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework introduced by Finn et al. (2017) to achieve improved performance by analyzing the temporal dynamics of the optimization procedure via the Runge-Kutta method. This method enables us to gain fine-grained control over the optimization and helps us achieve both the adaptation and representation goals across tasks. By leveraging this refined control, we demonstrate that there are multiple principled ways to update MAML and show that the classic MAML optimization is simply a special case of second-order Runge-Kutta method that mainly focuses on fast-adaptation. Experiments on benchmark classification, regression and reinforcement learning tasks show that this refined control helps attain improved results.",0

"Off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods are a powerful class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Intriguingly, deep off-policy TD algorithms are not commonly used in combination with feature normalization techniques, despite positive effects of normalization in other domains. We show that naive application of existing normalization techniques is indeed not effective, but that well-designed normalization improves optimization stability and removes the necessity of target networks. In particular, we introduce a normalization based on a mixture of on- and off-policy transitions, which we call cross-normalization. It can be regarded as an extension of batch normalization that re-centers data for two different distributions, as present in off-policy learning. Applied to DDPG and TD3, cross-normalization improves over the state of the art across a range of MuJoCo benchmark tasks.",0

Traditional manipulation tasks have focused on achieving predefined goals without considering the diversity and flexibility required in real-world situations. We present three different approaches that allow robots to learn from experience how to interact with objects in order to achieve their desired outcome: imitation learning, inverse modeling, and interactive exploration. By training these models using massive amounts of data generated by human demonstration, we demonstrate significant improvements in robot dexterity and adaptability compared to previous methods. Our results showcase the potential of deep reinforcement learning as a powerful tool for enhancing robotic manipulation capabilities in unstructured environments.

"We consider the problem of how a teacher algorithm can enable an unknown Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) student to become good at a skill over a wide range of diverse environments. To do so, we study how a teacher algorithm can learn to generate a learning curriculum, whereby it sequentially samples parameters controlling a stochastic procedural generation of environments. Because it does not initially know the capacities of its student, a key challenge for the teacher is to discover which environments are easy, difficult or unlearnable, and in what order to propose them to maximize the efficiency of learning over the learnable ones. To achieve this, this problem is transformed into a surrogate continuous bandit problem where the teacher samples environments in order to maximize absolute learning progress of its student. We present a new algorithm modeling absolute learning progress with Gaussian mixture models (ALP-GMM). We also adapt existing algorithms and provide a complete study in the context of DRL. Using parameterized variants of the BipedalWalker environment, we study their efficiency to personalize a learning curriculum for different learners (embodiments), their robustness to the ratio of learnable/unlearnable environments, and their scalability to non-linear and high-dimensional parameter spaces.

"In this paper, we present teacher algorithms for curriculum learning of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in continuously parameterized environments. Our approach leverages recent advances in modeling task difficulty using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which provides a flexible framework for designing effective teacher signals that guide the learning process. We demonstrate experimentally on a variety of challenging continuous control tasks that our method improves sample efficiency, stability, and final performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show how these improvements transfer across multiple problem domains and scales, making our technique highly versatile. Finally, we provide insights into the properties of MMD as a measure of task complexity, offering new perspectives on algorithmic development and evaluation for RL in highdimensional spaces. Overall, our work offers a promising direction towards efficient and robust training of deep neural network policies in complex and real-world-like settings.",1
"Integration of reinforcement learning and imitation learning is an important problem that has been studied for a long time in the field of intelligent robotics. Reinforcement learning optimizes policies to maximize the cumulative reward, whereas imitation learning attempts to extract general knowledge about the trajectories demonstrated by experts, i.e., demonstrators. Because each of them has their own drawbacks, methods combining them and compensating for each set of drawbacks have been explored thus far. However, many of the methods are heuristic and do not have a solid theoretical basis. In this paper, we present a new theory for integrating reinforcement and imitation learning by extending the probabilistic generative model framework for reinforcement learning, {\it plan by inference}. We develop a new probabilistic graphical model for reinforcement learning with multiple types of rewards and a probabilistic graphical model for Markov decision processes with multiple optimality emissions (pMDP-MO). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the integrated learning method of reinforcement learning and imitation learning can be formulated as a probabilistic inference of policies on pMDP-MO by considering the output of the discriminator in generative adversarial imitation learning as an additional optimal emission observation. We adapt the generative adversarial imitation learning and task-achievement reward to our proposed framework, achieving significantly better performance than agents trained with reinforcement learning or imitation learning alone. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully integrates imitation and reinforcement learning even when the number of demonstrators is only a few.",0
"Imitation learning has been increasingly used as a methodology to teach agents how to perform tasks by observing demonstrations from experts. However, imitation learning can suffer from several issues such as poor generalization across environments, limited ability to handle state uncertainty, and high sample complexity. In order to address these limitations, we propose integrating both reinforcement learning (RL) and inverse model-based planning into an imitation framework using probabilistic graphical models. We use Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), which trains an agent policy to mimic expert behavior by minimizing the difference between their actions and those of the expert. To enable efficient exploration during training, we incorporate task achievement rewards that encourage the agent to reach specific milestones along the trajectory. This allows us to directly optimize the expected cumulative reward over all possible interactions between the agent and environment. Our proposed method enables better generalization across environments, improved handling of state uncertainty, and reduced sample complexity compared to traditional imitation methods. We demonstrate through experiments that our approach outperforms other state-of-the art algorithms on continuous control benchmarks. Our work provides insights into developing more effective machine learning algorithms that combine imitation learning with reward optimization techniques towards achieving robust autonomous decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Conventional neural architecture search (NAS) approaches are based on reinforcement learning or evolutionary strategy, which take more than 3000 GPU hours to find a good model on CIFAR-10. We propose an efficient NAS approach learning to search by gradient descent. Our approach represents the search space as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This DAG contains billions of sub-graphs, each of which indicates a kind of neural architecture. To avoid traversing all the possibilities of the sub-graphs, we develop a differentiable sampler over the DAG. This sampler is learnable and optimized by the validation loss after training the sampled architecture. In this way, our approach can be trained in an end-to-end fashion by gradient descent, named Gradient-based search using Differentiable Architecture Sampler (GDAS). In experiments, we can finish one searching procedure in four GPU hours on CIFAR-10, and the discovered model obtains a test error of 2.82\% with only 2.5M parameters, which is on par with the state-of-the-art. Code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/D-X-Y/NAS-Projects.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing deep neural networks that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, designing effective architectures remains a challenging problem, requiring extensive computational resources and manual engineering expertise. In our work, we propose a novel approach to automatically search over a large space of possible architectures using efficient approximations of model performance metrics such as validation accuracy. Our algorithm allows us to rapidly explore architecture space by training small models (about 4 GPU hours) on proxy problems that predict how well they would perform if scaled up. We evaluate our method across three common benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Large Scale Academic Question Answering Challenge (LAION). Experiments show that our algorithm reliably finds new architectures that outperform strong baselines on all three tasks while searching orders of magnitude less than previously reported methods. This demonstrates the potential for automating aspects of neural network design and highlights opportunities for future research into learning optimal model search policies from data.",1
"There is a growing demand for planning redirected walking techniques and applying them to physical environments with obstacles. Such techniques are mainly managed using three kinds of methods: direct scripting, generalized controller, and physical- or virtual-environment analysis to determine user redirection. The first approach is effective when a user's path and both physical and virtual environments are fixed; however, it is difficult to handle irregular movements and reuse other environments. The second approach has the potential of reusing any environment but is less optimized. The last approach is highly anticipated and versatile, although it has not been sufficiently developed. In this study, we propose a novel redirection controller using reinforcement learning with advanced plannability/versatility. Our simulation experiments show that the proposed strategy can reduce the number of resets by 20.3% for physical-space conditions with multiple obstacles.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making great strides towards achieving human level competence in a variety of tasks. However, most existing methods rely on hand-engineered features that limit their generalizability across different problems and environments. To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored learning from raw sensory inputs, such as images and videos, by training deep neural networks to predict the consequences of actions taken in simulated worlds. This approach allows agents to learn complex behaviors directly from experience without any explicit guidance. Despite significant progress made using supervised and unsupervised pretraining objectives, it remains challenging to achieve optimal control policies due to sparse reward signals and high sample complexity. In this paper, we propose a new reinforcement learning method based on redirection controllers that leverage prior knowledge in the form of state abstractions and task hints obtained via self-play in diverse game domains. We show that our algorithm can effectively guide exploration by generating goals that direct the agent towards novel states and informative feedback, resulting in faster convergence and improved performance compared to baseline approaches. Our work demonstrates the potential benefits of integrating domain-specific prior knowledge into modern reinforcement learning algorithms, paving the way towards more effective artificial intelligent agents capable of solving real-world tasks efficiently.",1
"According to a mainstream position in contemporary cognitive science and philosophy, the use of abstract compositional concepts is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for the presence of genuine thought. In this article, we show how the ability to develop and utilise abstract conceptual structures can be achieved by a particular kind of learning agents. More specifically, we provide and motivate a concrete operational definition of what it means for these agents to be in possession of abstract concepts, before presenting an explicit example of a minimal architecture that supports this capability. We then proceed to demonstrate how the existence of abstract conceptual structures can be operationally useful in the process of employing previously acquired knowledge in the face of new experiences, thereby vindicating the natural conjecture that the cognitive functions of abstraction and generalisation are closely related.

"Inferring the existence of unobserved variables in a complex environment poses significant challenges for learning agents, particularly those operating under limited computational resources. Yet, such inference is crucial for agents operating in dynamic environments where accurate prediction requires knowledge of latent processes that cannot directly observed. This paper presents a new approach for achieving efficient variable inference using a Bayesian framework and explores its application on real-world datasets. Our method enables an agent to make probabilistic predictions about hidden states without explicit modeling of their dynamics, providing a computationally tractable solution suitable for minimal agents navigating high-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate how our algorithm outperforms traditional state estimation techniques across diverse domains, including a simulated robotic manipulation task and a complex weather forecasting problem. By introducing a novel variational approach capable of capturing complex dependencies while maintaining scalability, we provide a promising direction towards enabling minimal learners to operate effectively in ambiguous environments replete with unseen phenomena.",1
"In statistics and machine learning, approximation of an intractable integration is often achieved by using the unbiased Monte Carlo estimator, but the variances of the estimation are generally high in many applications. Control variates approaches are well-known to reduce the variance of the estimation. These control variates are typically constructed by employing predefined parametric functions or polynomials, determined by using those samples drawn from the relevant distributions. Instead, we propose to construct those control variates by learning neural networks to handle the cases when test functions are complex. In many applications, obtaining a large number of samples for Monte Carlo estimation is expensive, which may result in overfitting when training a neural network. We thus further propose to employ auxiliary random variables induced by the original ones to extend data samples for training the neural networks. We apply the proposed control variates with augmented variables to thermodynamic integration and reinforcement learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve significant variance reduction compared with other alternatives.",0
"""Reducing variance is a crucial task in many domains where accurate predictions are necessary, such as finance, robotics, and machine learning. One approach to reduce variance is through the use of control variates, which can be added to simulated data to reduce the sampling error without changing the underlying distribution. In practice, selecting appropriate control variates is challenging because they need to satisfy two conflicting requirements: having low correlation with the target variable while maximizing the reduction in variance. Recently, deep neural networks have shown great potential for generating effective controls by predicting them directly from the input variables. This paper presents a novel method that combines traditional control variate techniques with deep learning models called 'Neural Control Variates'. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, we demonstrate how our method outperforms existing ones on several real-world datasets. Our findings showcase the efficacy of using neural models for reducing the variance in complex systems.""  This paper introduces ""Neural Control Variates"" (NCV), a new framework that integrates classical control variate methods with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

"A plethora of problems in AI, engineering and the sciences are naturally formalized as inference in discrete probabilistic models. Exact inference is often prohibitively expensive, as it may require evaluating the (unnormalized) target density on its entire domain. Here we consider the setting where only a limited budget of calls to the unnormalized density oracle is available, raising the challenge of where in the domain to allocate these function calls in order to construct a good approximate solution. We formulate this problem as an instance of sequential decision-making under uncertainty and leverage methods from reinforcement learning for probabilistic inference with budget constraints. In particular, we propose the TreeSample algorithm, an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search to approximate inference. This algorithm caches all previous queries to the density oracle in an explicit search tree, and dynamically allocates new queries based on a ""best-first"" heuristic for exploration, using existing upper confidence bound methods. Our non-parametric inference method can be effectively combined with neural networks that compile approximate conditionals of the target, which are then used to guide the inference search and enable generalization across multiple target distributions. We show empirically that TreeSample outperforms standard approximate inference methods on synthetic factor graphs.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for approximate inference in discrete distributions using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and value functions. MCTS has been previously used for planning and decision making under uncertainty, but has not yet been applied to inference problems. We propose using the expected improvement algorithm with a tree search approach, where each node in the tree represents a hypothesis on the state of the world. Value functions are introduced as a means of guiding the search towards relevant parts of the solution space. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively solve realworld inference tasks, outperforming both naive sampling methods and traditional optimization techniques. Our work shows promising applications in domains such as game playing, robotics, and finance, among others.",1
"Navigating complex urban environments safely is a key to realize fully autonomous systems. Predicting future locations of vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, thus, has received a lot of attention in the recent years. While previous works have addressed modeling interactions with the static (obstacles) and dynamic (humans) environment agents, we address an important gap in trajectory prediction. We propose SafeCritic, a model that synergizes generative adversarial networks for generating multiple ""real"" trajectories with reinforcement learning to generate ""safe"" trajectories. The Discriminator evaluates the generated candidates on whether they are consistent with the observed inputs. The Critic network is environmentally aware to prune trajectories that are in collision or are in violation with the environment. The auto-encoding loss stabilizes training and prevents mode-collapse. We demonstrate results on two large scale data sets with a considerable improvement over state-of-the-art. We also show that the Critic is able to classify the safety of trajectories.",0
"""This paper presents a novel approach to collision-aware trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, called SafeCritic. The method uses deep learning models trained on large amounts of real-world driving data to accurately predict potential collisions and provide safe and efficient paths for the vehicle to follow. Unlike other methods that focus solely on collision avoidance, our approach takes into account the overall safety of the predicted path by considering factors such as speed limits and traffic regulations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the system using both simulation data and real-world test scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in avoiding collisions while maintaining a high level of efficiency.""",1
"Reparameterization (RP) and likelihood ratio (LR) gradient estimators are used throughout machine and reinforcement learning; however, they are usually explained as simple mathematical tricks without providing any insight into their nature. We use a first principles approach to explain LR and RP, and show a connection between the two via the divergence theorem. The theory motivated us to derive optimal importance sampling schemes to reduce LR gradient variance. Our newly derived distributions have analytic probability densities and can be directly sampled from. The improvement for Gaussian target distributions was modest, but for other distributions such as a Beta distribution, our method could lead to arbitrarily large improvements, and was crucial to obtain competitive performance in evolution strategies experiments.",0
"This paper presents a unified framework that reconciles two different views on how to calculate gradient estimates under arbitrary parameter transformations, thus resolving a longstanding dispute in the field of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We demonstrate that both likelihood ratio gradients and reparameterization gradients can be derived from a single formula under specific assumptions, which we term “generalized missing data” conditions. Our approach leads to closed form expressions for these gradients, as well as the corresponding weights required for optimal importance sampling, allowing us to obtain efficient and accurate estimates of model parameters using MCMC methods. The findings reported here have important implications for applications across many fields where Bayesian inference based on complex hierarchical models requires computationally intensive computations. The results presented provide new insights into existing literature, thereby advancing our understanding of how to perform approximate posterior simulation. By demonstrating the existence of a common connection between these two apparently conflicting approaches, we establish general theoretical guarantees that allow practitioners to select either technique based on their preference without any ambiguity regarding the quality of the resulting estimates. Furthermore, our work paves the way towards more advanced computational strategies by introducing novel diagnostics tools aimed at monitoring algorithm convergence and detecting potential numerical issues arising during MCMC simulations. Overall, this research represents a significant contribution to current knowledge, filling a gap in the state-of-the-art while providing practical solutions for real-world challenges related to statistical analysis and machine learning.",1
"A significant challenge for the practical application of reinforcement learning in the real world is the need to specify an oracle reward function that correctly defines a task. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to avoid this challenge by instead inferring a reward function from expert behavior. While appealing, it can be impractically expensive to collect datasets of demonstrations that cover the variation common in the real world (e.g. opening any type of door). Thus in practice, IRL must commonly be performed with only a limited set of demonstrations where it can be exceedingly difficult to unambiguously recover a reward function. In this work, we exploit the insight that demonstrations from other tasks can be used to constrain the set of possible reward functions by learning a ""prior"" that is specifically optimized for the ability to infer expressive reward functions from limited numbers of demonstrations. We demonstrate that our method can efficiently recover rewards from images for novel tasks and provide intuition as to how our approach is analogous to learning a prior.",0
"In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a prior distribution over agent intentions using meta-inverse reinforcement learning (meta-IRL). We observe that in many real-world scenarios, agents exhibit complex behaviors that may arise from multiple intentions, making it difficult for an IRL algorithm to disentangle these underlying intentions directly from observed behavior. Our key insight is that by framing intention inference as a problem of understanding human preferences, we can leverage prior knowledge about the space of possible intentions, allowing us to learn a more informative prior distribution over intentions.  Our proposed method utilizes a neural network to model the prior distribution over intentions and leverages a meta-learning framework to optimize for a task-specific loss function that captures how well the prior predicts behavior on new tasks. To validate our approach, we perform experiments across multiple domains and show that our meta-IRL approach outperforms standard IRL methods in terms of both accuracy and interpretability in identifying agent intents. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to non-game environments by applying it to real-world traffic data where we successfully infer high-level driving goals such as reaching a destination versus avoiding traffic congestion.  Overall, our work presents a powerful tool for understanding intentional agents in complex environments and has important implications for applications ranging from autonomous systems to decision support for humans.",1
"We present foundations for using Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a differentiable policy class for reinforcement learning in continuous state and action spaces. This provides one way of leveraging and combining the advantages of model-free and model-based approaches. Specifically, we differentiate through MPC by using the KKT conditions of the convex approximation at a fixed point of the controller. Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class. We show that our MPC policies are significantly more data-efficient than a generic neural network and that our method is superior to traditional system identification in a setting where the expert is unrealizable.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to end-to-end planning and control using differentiable model predictive control (MPC). Traditional MPC methods use linear models and quadratic objectives, but these approaches can suffer from brittleness and poor performance under uncertainty.

We show that our method outperforms traditional MPC methods on several challenging tasks and provides better stability guarantees through automatic differentiation of continuous constraints. By combining the strengths of machine learning and control theory, we achieve more efficient, flexible, and reliable control systems.",1
"The performance of imitation learning is typically upper-bounded by the performance of the demonstrator. While recent empirical results demonstrate that ranked demonstrations allow for better-than-demonstrator performance, preferences over demonstrations may be difficult to obtain, and little is known theoretically about when such methods can be expected to successfully extrapolate beyond the performance of the demonstrator. To address these issues, we first contribute a sufficient condition for better-than-demonstrator imitation learning and provide theoretical results showing why preferences over demonstrations can better reduce reward function ambiguity when performing inverse reinforcement learning. Building on this theory, we introduce Disturbance-based Reward Extrapolation (D-REX), a ranking-based imitation learning method that injects noise into a policy learned through behavioral cloning to automatically generate ranked demonstrations. These ranked demonstrations are used to efficiently learn a reward function that can then be optimized using reinforcement learning. We empirically validate our approach on simulated robot and Atari imitation learning benchmarks and show that D-REX outperforms standard imitation learning approaches and can significantly surpass the performance of the demonstrator. D-REX is the first imitation learning approach to achieve significant extrapolation beyond the demonstrator's performance without additional side-information or supervision, such as rewards or human preferences. By generating rankings automatically, we show that preference-based inverse reinforcement learning can be applied in traditional imitation learning settings where only unlabeled demonstrations are available.",0
"Imitation learning has become a popular approach for training agents to perform complex tasks by observing and mimicking human demonstrations. However, most imitation learning algorithms struggle with handling large amounts of variability present in human demonstrations. This study proposes a novel approach that addresses this issue by using automatically-ranked demonstrations. Our method first uses a deep network to predict the quality of each demonstration based on how well it achieves certain objectives. These predicted qualities are then used as weights to combine the individual actions from multiple rankings into a final synthesized action sequence. Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and achieve better performance than the average human demonstrator across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks. Our results suggest that using automatically ranked demonstrations can greatly enhance the effectiveness of imitation learning algorithms and lead to more advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of performing diverse and complex tasks.",1
"Entropy regularized algorithms such as Soft Q-learning and Soft Actor-Critic, recently showed state-of-the-art performance on a number of challenging reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The regularized formulation modifies the standard RL objective and thus generally converges to a policy different from the optimal greedy policy of the original RL problem. Practically, it is important to control the sub-optimality of the regularized optimal policy. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions for convergence of a large class of regularized dynamic programming algorithms, unified under regularized modified policy iteration (MPI) and conservative value iteration (VI) schemes. We provide explicit convergence rates to the optimality depending on the decrease rate of the regularization parameter. Our experiments show that the empirical error closely follows the established theoretical convergence rates. In addition to optimality, we demonstrate two desirable behaviours of the regularized algorithms even in the absence of approximations: robustness to stochasticity of environment and safety of trajectories induced by the policy iterates.",0
"This paper provides an analysis of approximate policy iteration (API) algorithms and regularized policy iteration (RPI) methods used in reinforcement learning (RL). We show that API and RPI can be viewed as two distinct approaches to solving finite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we explore their relationships. Our primary result shows the convergence of these two schemes under mild conditions on problem parameters such as discount factors and regularization constants. By carefully analyzing the convergence rate and error bounds of both schemes under different settings, we identify potential advantages and drawbacks of each approach. Finally, our findings contribute to better understanding of how to choose appropriate methods for specific applications in RL problems. On the convergence of approximate and regularized policy iteration schemes: A comparative study in reinforcement learning In recent years, approximate policy iteration (API) and regularized policy iteration (RPI) have emerged as popular techniques to solve finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we provide a detailed comparison of the convergence properties of these two methodologies. Under suitable assumptions on model parameters such as discount rates and regularization constants, we prove that API and RPI share a common solution, demonstrating the theoretical equivalency of these seemingly disparate frameworks. Through numerical experiments, we evaluate the impact of algorithmic hyperparameters on the quality of solutions produced by both approaches and assess whether one scheme consistently outperforms the other across varying MDP parameterizations. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings regarding which technique may be more advantageous to deploy depending upon specific characteristics of the RL task at hand. Overall, this work contributes to a deeper comprehension of MDP solvers in RL, facilitating informed selections of models and methods in future research endeavors.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used in autonomous driving tasks and training RL models typically involves in a multi-step process: pre-training RL models on simulators, uploading the pre-trained model to real-life robots, and fine-tuning the weight parameters on robot vehicles. This sequential process is extremely time-consuming and more importantly, knowledge from the fine-tuned model stays local and can not be re-used or leveraged collaboratively. To tackle this problem, we present an online federated RL transfer process for real-time knowledge extraction where all the participant agents make corresponding actions with the knowledge learned by others, even when they are acting in very different environments. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we constructed a real-life collision avoidance system with Microsoft Airsim simulator and NVIDIA JetsonTX2 car agents, which cooperatively learn from scratch to avoid collisions in indoor environment with obstacle objects. We demonstrate that with the proposed framework, the simulator car agents can transfer knowledge to the RC cars in real-time, with 27% increase in the average distance with obstacles and 42% decrease in the collision counts.",0
"Federated transfer reinforcement learning (FTRL) has emerged as a promising approach to address several challenges in autonomous driving.

"This paper makes one step forward towards characterizing a new family of \textit{model-free} Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms. The aim of these algorithms is to jointly learn an approximation of the state-value function ($V$), alongside an approximation of the state-action value function ($Q$). Our analysis starts with a thorough study of the Deep Quality-Value Learning (DQV) algorithm, a DRL algorithm which has been shown to outperform popular techniques such as Deep-Q-Learning (DQN) and Double-Deep-Q-Learning (DDQN) \cite{sabatelli2018deep}. Intending to investigate why DQV's learning dynamics allow this algorithm to perform so well, we formulate a set of research questions which help us characterize a new family of DRL algorithms. Among our results, we present some specific cases in which DQV's performance can get harmed and introduce a novel \textit{off-policy} DRL algorithm, called DQV-Max, which can outperform DQV. We then study the behavior of the $V$ and $Q$ functions that are learned by DQV and DQV-Max and show that both algorithms might perform so well on several DRL test-beds because they are less prone to suffer from the overestimation bias of the $Q$ function.",0
"In recent years, Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence. At its core lies the idea that agents can learn complex behaviors by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. Two popular types of DRL algorithms are Q-learning and policy gradients. Both methods rely on a single value function, either the Q-value or the advantage function, which serves as a measure of expected return from taking a given action. However, these value functions may sometimes fail to capture all aspects of the agent’s behavioral preferences, leading to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we propose approximating two separate value functions that reflect different desires and constraints of the agent. This allows us to better balance multiple objectives and incorporate domain knowledge into our model. Our approach can be seen as a generalization of both Q-learning and policy gradient methods. We provide proof of concept experiments demonstrating the potential benefits of using multiple value functions in real world applications such as robotics and game playing tasks.",1

"Abstract: Article Summary: In this paper, we aim to reduce the variance and overestimation of deep q-learning (DQL) by proposing two new approaches based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Firstly, we introduce a novel variant called Risk-Aware MCTS that integrates risk assessment into DQL using expected cumulative regret as an additional objective. This method leads to more conservative actions while maintaining optimal values, resulting in a smaller confidence interval around estimated action value functions. Secondly, we develop Confidence-Based MCTS which uses bootstrapping techniques to estimate state visitation probabilities during planning. By balancing exploration and exploitation, our approach achieves a better tradeoff between underestimation and overestimation, thus reducing uncertainty without compromising performance. Experimental results show that both proposed methods outperform standard DQL on various benchmark games, demonstrating their effectiveness in addressing issues related to overestimation and variance reduction.

"Reinforcement learning algorithms are known to be sample inefficient, and often performance on one task can be substantially improved by leveraging information (e.g., via pre-training) on other related tasks. In this work, we propose a technique to achieve such knowledge transfer in cases where agent trajectories contain sensitive or private information, such as in the healthcare domain. Our approach leverages a differentially private policy evaluation algorithm to initialize an actor-critic model and improve the effectiveness of learning in downstream tasks. We empirically show this technique increases sample efficiency in resource-constrained control problems while preserving the privacy of trajectories collected in an upstream task.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising areas of artificial intelligence research due to its ability to learn policies directly from raw sensory inputs without explicit human supervision. One popular variant of deep reinforcement learning is actor critic, which separates policy evaluation into a value function (critic) that evaluates states and actions according to their expected cumulative reward, and a policy network (actor) that takes actions based on the current state and available options.  However, many real-world applications of reinforcement learning require handling sensitive data or decision making under uncertainty, such as medical treatment planning or autonomous vehicles in public spaces. Existing solutions rely on techniques like homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation, which introduce significant computational overheads and limitations.  To address these challenges, we propose Actor Critic with Differentially Private Critic (ACDPC), a novel approach that integrates differential privacy into the design of actor critic systems. Differential privacy provides strong guarantees regarding individuals’ privacy by adding random noise to query results, reducing the likelihood that malicious entities can identify specific records while ensuring statistical validity at the population level. By using a private loss signal during training, ACDPC effectively minimizes any potential leakage of confidential information while maintaining good performance. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in protecting user privacy while simultaneously achieving competitive accuracy compared to standard methods. Our work contributes to the development of practical and efficient frameworks for deep RL algorithms that guarantee individual privacy while generating high-quality decisions.",1

"In recent years, there has been significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks, to synthesize code. This approach, known as program synthesis by self-learning, involves training models on large datasets of programs and their corresponding specifications, allowing them to learn patterns that can be used to generate new code automatically.  One major advantage of this approach is that it allows developers to create code more efficiently than traditional manual methods, freeing up time and resources for other tasks. Additionally, because these systems use data from real-world examples, they can often produce high-quality results that match human expectations.  However, despite its potential benefits, program synthesis by self-learning remains a complex and challenging problem due to several factors. For example, the quality of generated code depends heavily on the size, diversity, and representativeness of the dataset used to train the model. Furthermore, specifying desired behavior accurately and concisely continues to pose difficulties for both humans and machines alike.

"Owing to their ability to both effectively integrate information over long time horizons and scale to massive amounts of data, self-attention architectures have recently shown breakthrough success in natural language processing (NLP), achieving state-of-the-art results in domains such as language modeling and machine translation. Harnessing the transformer's ability to process long time horizons of information could provide a similar performance boost in partially observable reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but the large-scale transformers used in NLP have yet to be successfully applied to the RL setting. In this work we demonstrate that the standard transformer architecture is difficult to optimize, which was previously observed in the supervised learning setting but becomes especially pronounced with RL objectives. We propose architectural modifications that substantially improve the stability and learning speed of the original Transformer and XL variant. The proposed architecture, the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL), surpasses LSTMs on challenging memory environments and achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-task DMLab-30 benchmark suite, exceeding the performance of an external memory architecture. We show that the GTrXL, trained using the same losses, has stability and performance that consistently matches or exceeds a competitive LSTM baseline, including on more reactive tasks where memory is less critical. GTrXL offers an easy-to-train, simple-to-implement but substantially more expressive architectural alternative to the standard multi-layer LSTM ubiquitously used for RL agents in partially observable environments.",0
"Overview: In recent years, transformer models have been widely used in natural language processing tasks due to their impressive performance. However, in reinforcement learning (RL), stabilization techniques such as gradient clipping and weight decay are often employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability. This study investigates whether applying similar stabilization methods to RL algorithms that use transformer architectures can enhance stability and outperformance compared to existing approaches.  Methodology: We propose several novel stabilization methods based on gradient clipping and attention dropout to reduce model complexity and increase robustness in RL settings. These techniques were implemented and evaluated across multiple domains using popular deep RL frameworks.  Results: Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating stabilization strategies into transformer models yields improvements in both stability and performance, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on benchmark RL environments. Furthermore, our proposed methods achieve faster convergence rates than unstabilized baseline models, requiring fewer iterations to reach higher returns. Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in leveraging stabilization mechanisms for improving RL with transformer-based algorithms. By enhancing the stability and efficiency of these models, we open up exciting new opportunities for researchers in the field seeking to address challenges related to scalability and applicability. Ultimately, our findings provide evidence that embracing stabilization techniques in conjunction with powerful neural network architectures can lead to more effective solutions for complex decision making problems under uncertainty.",1
"An algorithmic decision-maker incentivizes people to act in certain ways to receive better decisions. These incentives can dramatically influence subjects' behaviors and lives, and it is important that both decision-makers and decision-recipients have clarity on which actions are incentivized by the chosen model. While for linear functions, the changes a subject is incentivized to make may be clear, we prove that for many non-linear functions (e.g. neural networks, random forests), classical methods for interpreting the behavior of models (e.g. input gradients) provide poor advice to individuals on which actions they should take. In this work, we propose a mathematical framework for understanding algorithmic incentives as the challenge of solving a Markov Decision Process, where the state includes the set of input features, and the reward is a function of the model's output. We can then leverage the many toolkits for solving MDPs (e.g. tree-based planning, reinforcement learning) to identify the optimal actions each individual is incentivized to take to improve their decision under a given model. We demonstrate the utility of our method by estimating the maximally-incentivized actions in two real-world settings: a recidivism risk predictor we train using ProPublica's COMPAS dataset, and an online credit scoring tool published by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO).",0
"Black box models have become increasingly popular due to their ability to make accurate predictions on complex problems without requiring explicit knowledge of how they arrived at these decisions. However, one major drawback of black box models is that they lack transparency, making it difficult to understand why certain decisions were made or to verify if the outcomes align with the goals of decision makers. This can lead to distrust among users and limited adoption in high stakes settings such as healthcare or finance.  In this paper, we propose a methodology to extract incentives from black box decisions by analyzing the input features used by these models and understanding how changes in feature values impact the outcome. By studying the sensitivity of black box outputs to different inputs, we aim to identify which factors contribute most significantly to the model's final recommendation. We evaluate our approach using several case studies across multiple domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing important relationships between input features and predicted outcomes. Our work contributes to the field of explainable artificial intelligence, providing insights into the behavior of black box models and helping build trust in their decision making processes.",1
"Smart and agile drones are fast becoming ubiquitous at the edge of the cloud. The usage of these drones are constrained by their limited power and compute capability. In this paper, we present a Transfer Learning (TL) based approach to reduce on-board computation required to train a deep neural network for autonomous navigation via Deep Reinforcement Learning for a target algorithmic performance. A library of 3D realistic meta-environments is manually designed using Unreal Gaming Engine and the network is trained end-to-end. These trained meta-weights are then used as initializers to the network in a test environment and fine-tuned for the last few fully connected layers. Variation in drone dynamics and environmental characteristics is carried out to show robustness of the approach. Using NVIDIA GPU profiler it was shown that the energy consumption and training latency is reduced by 3.7x and 1.8x respectively without significant degradation in the performance in terms of average distance traveled before crash i.e. Mean Safe Flight (MSF). The approach is also tested on a real environment using DJI Tello drone and similar results were reported.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing autonomous navigation systems that can operate in resource constraint edge nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or small robots. These systems must be able to navigate through complex environments while operating under severe memory and computational power limitations. One approach that shows promise for solving these challenges is deep reinforcement learning (DRL).  This paper proposes a DRL framework called Autonomous Navigation via Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Constraint Edge Nodes using Transfer Learning (ANDRENE). ANDRENE combines state-of-the-art techniques from both transfer learning and DRL to train agents capable of navigating a variety of environments within realistic constraints on memory and computation. Our method leverages pretrained models from simulation to efficiently learn new tasks across different types of edge nodes, including UAVs and robots equipped with camera sensors.  Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods in terms of speed and accuracy in navigational tasks. We evaluate our model on multiple challenging scenarios, including simulated indoor environments and real outdoor flight tests using quadcopters. Furthermore, we showcase how ANDRENE adapts rapidly to changes in environment or task parameters without requiring additional training data, thanks to its strong transfer learning capabilities.  In summary, ANDRENE represents a major advancement towards enabling intelligent edge devices with reliable autonomy in complex and uncertain environments. By blending insights from both transfer learning and DRL into a single coherent framework, ANDRENE enables faster and more effective agent learning even when computing resources are scarce, making it highly attractive for numerous real-world applications.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning could enable sample-efficient learning by quickly acquiring rich knowledge about the world and using it to improve behaviour without additional data. Learned dynamics models can be directly used for planning actions but this has been challenging because of inaccuracies in the learned models. In this paper, we focus on planning with learned dynamics models and propose to regularize it using energy estimates of state transitions in the environment. We visually demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that off-policy training of an energy estimator can be effectively used to regularize planning with pre-trained dynamics models. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed method enables sample-efficient learning to achieve competitive performance in challenging continuous control tasks such as Half-cheetah and Ant in just a few minutes of experience.",0
"This paper focuses on regularizing model-based planning using energy based models. We first discuss how model-based planning can suffer from high variability due to incorrect initializations, poor generalization performance and sensitivity to hyperparameters such as learning rates. To address these issues we propose introducing prior knowledge into the optimization problem via deep inverse potential fields (DIPFs), which allow us to guide the planner towards smooth motions. Our approach leads to robust planning performances and significantly reduces the computational cost by requiring fewer optimization steps per rollout. Additionally we show that our method generalizes well across different scenarios and datasets compared to previous work. Finally we evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm compared against state-of-the-art model-free algorithms.",1
"Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning aims to address the exploration challenge for sparse-reward tasks. However, the study of exploration methods in transition-dependent multi-agent settings is largely absent from the literature. We aim to take a step towards solving this problem. We present two exploration methods: exploration via information-theoretic influence (EITI) and exploration via decision-theoretic influence (EDTI), by exploiting the role of interaction in coordinated behaviors of agents. EITI uses mutual information to capture influence transition dynamics. EDTI uses a novel intrinsic reward, called Value of Interaction (VoI), to characterize and quantify the influence of one agent's behavior on expected returns of other agents. By optimizing EITI or EDTI objective as a regularizer, agents are encouraged to coordinate their exploration and learn policies to optimize team performance. We show how to optimize these regularizers so that they can be easily integrated with policy gradient reinforcement learning. The resulting update rule draws a connection between coordinated exploration and intrinsic reward distribution. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the significant strength of our method in a variety of multi-agent scenarios.",0

"AI heralds a step-change in the performance and capability of wireless networks and other critical infrastructures. However, it may also cause irreversible environmental damage due to their high energy consumption. Here, we address this challenge in the context of 5G and beyond, where there is a complexity explosion in radio resource management (RRM). On the one hand, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a powerful tool for scalable optimization for high dimensional RRM problems in a dynamic environment. On the other hand, DRL algorithms consume a high amount of energy over time and risk compromising progress made in green radio research. This paper reviews and analyzes how to achieve green DRL for RRM via both architecture and algorithm innovations. Architecturally, a cloud based training and distributed decision-making DRL scheme is proposed, where RRM entities can make lightweight deep local decisions whilst assisted by on-cloud training and updating. On the algorithm level, compression approaches are introduced for both deep neural networks and the underlying Markov Decision Processes, enabling accurate low-dimensional representations of challenges. To scale learning across geographic areas, a spatial transfer learning scheme is proposed to further promote the learning efficiency of distributed DRL entities by exploiting the traffic demand correlations. Together, our proposed architecture and algorithms provide a vision for green and on-demand DRL capability.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing complex problems in radio resource management (RRM).

Our proposed architecture leverages several state-of-the-art techniques from both hardware design and machine learning domains, including model compression and algorithm acceleration. We evaluate our method through extensive simulation experiments using realistic network scenarios and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional RRM methods in terms of energy efficiency and system performance.

"Learning optimal feedback control laws capable of executing optimal trajectories is essential for many robotic applications. Such policies can be learned using reinforcement learning or planned using optimal control. While reinforcement learning is sample inefficient, optimal control only plans an optimal trajectory from a specific starting configuration. In this paper we propose deep optimal feedback control to learn an optimal feedback policy rather than a single trajectory. By exploiting the inherent structure of the robot dynamics and strictly convex action cost, we can derive principled cost functions such that the optimal policy naturally obeys the action limits, is globally optimal and stable on the training domain given the optimal value function. The corresponding optimal value function is learned end-to-end by embedding a deep differential network in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann differential equation and minimizing the error of this equality while simultaneously decreasing the discounting from short- to far-sighted to enable the learning. Our proposed approach enables us to learn an optimal feedback control law in continuous time, that in contrast to existing approaches generates an optimal trajectory from any point in state-space without the need of replanning. The resulting approach is evaluated on non-linear systems and achieves optimal feedback control, where standard optimal control methods require frequent replanning.",0
"Here is one possible abstract:  This paper presents methods for solving optimal feedback control problems using deep neural networks to approximate differential value functions that capture important features of the system dynamics and constraints. We consider situations where the state space and action space may be high dimensional, and traditional analytical approaches become difficult or impossible. Our approach involves discretizing time and space into small intervals/grid cells, using deep neural nets as function approximators at each grid point to represent both the state values and their derivatives. This allows us to learn policies via gradient descent on these grid points, which can then be used to select actions based on current states without having to explicitly solve partial differential equations (PDE) or Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equations. Additionally, we introduce novel techniques such as regularization by convolutional neural network architectures, use of sparse grids to reduce computational cost, and data augmentation with random perturbations. Numerical simulations demonstrate effectiveness on several benchmark examples, including systems with nonlinearities, switching costs, and pathological cases. Extensions to stochastic systems with uncertainty would broaden applicability further, but still requires more research. Overall our contributions are promising directions for efficient optimization under complex dynamics with general constraints, bridging the gap between model complexity and computation limitations. Future work could investigate scaling laws, connections with policy iteration type algorithms, and adaptive refinement strategies. Generalizations to hybrid systems with distinct modes of operation are also relevant for many engineering applications beyond those considered here. Open questions remain regarding stability guarantees for learned policies, interpretability tradeoffs due to deep representations, robustness of training procedures to input variations, and real-time implementation challenges in safety critical environments. While significant progress has been made towards automated decision making under uncertainty subject to performance metrics, additional experimental validation studies and comparisons against standard methods should motivate continued development along these lines.",1

"In the last decade, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to address complex sequential decision making problems, such as video games \cite{Mnih2013PlayingIA}, robotics manipulation tasks \cite{Levine2016EndtoendLearningMS} and autonomous driving vehicles\cite{Bojarski2016TowardsCA}. DRL algorithms learn directly from high-dimensional input/output streams, without any explicit model representation of the environment dynamics. These models have shown impressive performance on several benchmark domains by optimizing agent policies through trial and error by interacting with the environment. However, training these models requires large amounts of computational resources due to their sample complexity. To scale up DRL to larger and more realistic problem sizes, we need distributed systems that allow us to parallelize data collection over multiple GPUs or even multiple machines. There exists some work on scaling up DRL using distributed sampling techniques \cite{Lipton2019ParallelSamplesDM,Veness2017DistributedDR}; however, there remains challenges in designing fully integrated stacks suitable for both small and large problems while ensuring efficient utilization of computational hardware resources and robustness against network communication failures. This paper presents {the proposed architecture is an end-to-end solution for parallelizing neural networks across multiple devices, enabling fast, accurate training of deep RL models at extreme scales}.

"Imitation learning, followed by reinforcement learning algorithms, is a promising paradigm to solve complex control tasks sample-efficiently. However, learning from demonstrations often suffers from the covariate shift problem, which results in cascading errors of the learned policy. We introduce a notion of conservatively-extrapolated value functions, which provably lead to policies with self-correction. We design an algorithm Value Iteration with Negative Sampling (VINS) that practically learns such value functions with conservative extrapolation. We show that VINS can correct mistakes of the behavioral cloning policy on simulated robotics benchmark tasks. We also propose the algorithm of using VINS to initialize a reinforcement learning algorithm, which is shown to outperform significantly prior works in sample efficiency.",0
"This research presents a method for learning policies and value functions from demonstrations that incorporates negative sampling. In traditional imitation learning, agents learn by observing demonstrations of expert behavior. However, these demonstrations may contain errors or suboptimal actions. By introducing a small amount of negatively sampled data, the agent can better identify and correct mistakes in the demonstrated behaviors. Through experiments on simulated robotics tasks, we show that our approach leads to more robust and efficient policy learning compared to previous methods without negative sampling. Our results have implications for improving the reliability and performance of autonomous systems learned through imitation.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (MIRL) in a two-player general-sum stochastic game framework. Five variants of MIRL are considered: uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, and uNE-MIRL, each distinguished by its solution concept. Problem uCS-MIRL is a cooperative game in which the agents employ cooperative strategies that aim to maximize the total game value. In problem uCE-MIRL, agents are assumed to follow strategies that constitute a correlated equilibrium while maximizing total game value. Problem uNE-MIRL is similar to uCE-MIRL in total game value maximization, but it is assumed that the agents are playing a Nash equilibrium. Problems advE-MIRL and cooE-MIRL assume agents are playing an adversarial equilibrium and a coordination equilibrium, respectively. We propose novel approaches to address these five problems under the assumption that the game observer either knows or is able to accurate estimate the policies and solution concepts for players. For uCS-MIRL, we first develop a characteristic set of solutions ensuring that the observed bi-policy is a uCS and then apply a Bayesian inverse learning method. For uCE-MIRL, we develop a linear programming problem subject to constraints that define necessary and sufficient conditions for the observed policies to be correlated equilibria. The objective is to choose a solution that not only minimizes the total game value difference between the observed bi-policy and a local uCS, but also maximizes the scale of the solution. We apply a similar treatment to the problem of uNE-MIRL. The remaining two problems can be solved efficiently by taking advantage of solution uniqueness and setting up a convex optimization problem. Results are validated on various benchmark grid-world games.",0
"""This paper presents a novel approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in certain general-sum stochastic games (GSSGs). IRL involves inferring reward functions from observed agent behavior rather than designing rewards manually. However, traditional methods struggle with scalability and sample efficiency due to the high dimensionality of GSSG states and actions. Our proposed method tackles these issues by using multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients (MADDPG), which can learn policies directly from raw pixels without needing explicit feature engineering. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging domains while remaining interpretable. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both global game structure and local environmental dynamics during policy improvement.""",1
"Combining model-based and model-free deep reinforcement learning has shown great promise for improving sample efficiency on complex control tasks while still retaining high performance. Incorporating imagination is a recent effort in this direction inspired by human mental simulation of motor behavior. We propose a learning-adaptive imagination approach which, unlike previous approaches, takes into account the reliability of the learned dynamics model used for imagining the future. Our approach learns an ensemble of disjoint local dynamics models in latent space and derives an intrinsic reward based on learning progress, motivating the controller to take actions leading to data that improves the models. The learned models are used to generate imagined experiences, augmenting the training set of real experiences. We evaluate our approach on learning vision-based robotic grasping and show that it significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-optimal performance in a sparse reward environment.",0
"One of the challenges facing robotic grasping today is creating systems that can quickly learn new tasks without relying on large amounts of data or supervision. This research proposes a novel method called learning-adaptive imagination (LAIM) that uses latent space to create simulated environments where robots can explore their own imagination and improve their performance. By training the imagined images against real examples, LAIM reduces the gap between imagination and reality. With these capabilities, robots can perform more efficient intrinsic motivation experiments and achieve better generalization across diverse object sets and cluttered scenes. We evaluate our approach using extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved efficiency compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Our work paves the way towards the development of human-like robot skills through effective unsupervised learning.",1
"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a promising approach to solving long-horizon problems with sparse and delayed rewards. Many existing HRL algorithms either use pre-trained low-level skills that are unadaptable, or require domain-specific information to define low-level rewards. In this paper, we aim to adapt low-level skills to downstream tasks while maintaining the generality of reward design. We propose an HRL framework which sets auxiliary rewards for low-level skill training based on the advantage function of the high-level policy. This auxiliary reward enables efficient, simultaneous learning of the high-level policy and low-level skills without using task-specific knowledge. In addition, we also theoretically prove that optimizing low-level skills with this auxiliary reward will increase the task return for the joint policy. Experimental results show that our algorithm dramatically outperforms other state-of-the-art HRL methods in Mujoco domains. We also find both low-level and high-level policies trained by our algorithm transferable.",0
"This paper presents Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) with Advantage-Based Auxiliary Rewards (ABAR), which extends standard HRL algorithms by incorporating auxiliary rewards that guide learning towards desirable behaviors that may not be directly observable. The main contribution lies in introducing ABAR: advantage-based objectives that are calculated using importance sampling techniques based on TD errors relative to state action value function estimates obtained from temporal difference updates. By utilizing these advantages as additional rewards within HRL, we encourage agents to learn optimal policies that maximize both primary task rewards and ABAR objectives simultaneously. We argue that this approach offers a principled methodology for learning complex tasks by prioritizing behavioral goals and allows for more efficient exploration of high-dimensional spaces through hierarchical decomposition. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates improved performance across several challenging control problems compared to existing HRL methods without ABAR, confirming our claims and establishing the potential benefits of incorporating auxiliary guidance into hierarchical learning systems.",1
"We develop model free PAC performance guarantees for multiple concurrent MDPs, extending recent works where a single learner interacts with multiple non-interacting agents in a noise free environment. Our framework allows noisy and resource limited communication between agents, and develops novel PAC guarantees in this extended setting.

We provide a theoretically motivated algorithm that optimally combines information from the resource limited agents, thereby analyzing the interaction between noise and communication constraints that are ubiquitous in real-world systems. We present empirical results for a simple task that supports our theoretical formulations and improve upon naive information fusion methods.",0
"Title: ""PAC Guarantees for Cooperation in Multi-Agent Systems with Limited Communication""  Abstract: In multi-agent systems, cooperating agents can achieve better outcomes than selfish ones by sharing information and coordinating their actions. However, communication between agents can be costly and may introduce security risks. This work addresses the problem of achieving provably efficient cooperation among a group of agents with limited or restricted communication capabilities, using the framework of Probabilistically Approximately Correct (PAC) learning. We propose new algorithms that guarantee convergence to near-optimal solutions in average-reward settings under mild assumptions on agent interactions, while accounting for the constraints imposed by limited communication. Our theoretical results show that even with minimal exchange of information, well-designed PAC algorithms can promote effective collaboration among self-interested agents, resulting in significant benefits over individualized behavior. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of distributed decision making processes where communication resources are scarce but coordination is essential.",1
"Leveraging an equivalence property in the state-space of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) has been investigated in several studies. This paper studies equivalence structure in the reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where transition distributions are no longer assumed to be known. We present a notion of similarity between transition probabilities of various state-action pairs of an MDP, which naturally defines an equivalence structure in the state-action space. We present equivalence-aware confidence sets for the case where the learner knows the underlying structure in advance. These sets are provably smaller than their corresponding equivalence-oblivious counterparts. In the more challenging case of an unknown equivalence structure, we present an algorithm called ApproxEquivalence that seeks to find an (approximate) equivalence structure, and define confidence sets using the approximate equivalence. To illustrate the efficacy of the presented confidence sets, we present C-UCRL, as a natural modification of UCRL2 for RL in undiscounted MDPs. In the case of a known equivalence structure, we show that C-UCRL improves over UCRL2 in terms of regret by a factor of $\sqrt{SA/C}$, in any communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and $C$ classes, which corresponds to a massive improvement when $C \ll SA$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing regret bounds for RL when an equivalence structure in the MDP is efficiently exploited. In the case of an unknown equivalence structure, we show through numerical experiments that C-UCRL combined with ApproxEquivalence outperforms UCRL2 in ergodic MDPs.",0
"In the following, you can find an example for such an abstract. Note that I wrote this without reading the specific paper you mentioned so please make sure it fits your needs by checking all details:  Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to solving sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. One key challenge faced by model-based RL algorithms is the computational cost associated with solving Bellman equations or estimating models using sample data. This challenge becomes even more acute when dealing with high-dimensional state spaces or real-time applications. One potential solution lies in exploiting structural properties of the problem at hand. For instance, many tasks exhibit symmetries among states and actions, which can reduce the size of the optimization problem while preserving important information. In this work we introduce a method called model-based RL exploiting state-action equivalence (SATE), which leverages state-action equivalence to simplify the computation of optimal policies in large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our algorithm first learns an approximate MDP based on available data, then solves a reduced-size linear program (LP) to obtain an estimate of the optimal policy. We demonstrate through experiments on both discrete and continuous control tasks that our method significantly reduces complexity while achieving competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results showcase the advantages of incorporating domain knowledge into model-based RL algorithms, leading to better scalability and applicability to real-world scenarios. ---",1
"The aim of the inverse chemical design is to develop new molecules with given optimized molecular properties or objectives. Recently, generative deep learning (DL) networks are considered as the state-of-the-art in inverse chemical design and have achieved early success in generating molecular structures with desired properties in the pharmaceutical and material chemistry fields. However, satisfying a large number (larger than 10 objectives) of molecular objectives is a limitation of current generative models. To improve the model's ability to handle a large number of molecule design objectives, we developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based generative framework to optimize chemical molecule generation. Our use of Curriculum Learning (CL) to fine-tune the pre-trained generative network allowed the model to satisfy up to 21 objectives and increase the generative network's robustness. The experiments show that the proposed multiple-objective RL-based generative model can correctly identify unknown molecules with an 83 to 100 percent success rate, compared to the baseline approach of 0 percent. Additionally, this proposed generative model is not limited to just chemistry research challenges; we anticipate that problems that utilize RL with multiple-objectives will benefit from this framework.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to inverse design and identification using multiple-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). Traditional methods for inverse design and identification often rely on heuristics or ad hoc approaches that may not lead to optimal solutions. MORL offers a systematic and robust method for addressing these challenges by considering multiple objectives simultaneously.  The proposed framework uses a deep neural network as the function approximator for both the forward simulation model and the value function in the RL algorithm. A genetic algorithm is employed to generate diverse sets of parameters for different design alternatives. These alternative designs are then evaluated based on their performance across all objectives considered in the decision-making process. The final solution is selected based on Pareto dominance analysis of the generated set of parameter candidates.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical simulations involving a simplified aircraft conceptual design problem. Results show that the MORL approach outperforms traditional single-objective optimization techniques in terms of objective values achieved and computational efficiency. Additionally, sensitivity studies indicate that our approach can effectively handle problems where design parameters have significant uncertainties, thus providing more realistic solutions.  In summary, we present an innovative approach to inverse design and identification that incorporates MORL. Our approach demonstrates better performance than traditional techniques while remaining computationally efficient. Future work includes extending the applicability of this methodology to other complex engineering systems.",1
"When learning behavior, training data is often generated by the learner itself; this can result in unstable training dynamics, and this problem has particularly important applications in safety-sensitive real-world control tasks such as robotics. In this work, we propose a principled and model-agnostic approach to mitigate the issue of unstable learning dynamics by maintaining a history of a reinforcement learning agent over the course of training, and reverting to the parameters of a previous agent whenever performance significantly decreases. We develop techniques for evaluating this performance through statistical hypothesis testing of continued improvement, and evaluate them on a standard suite of challenging benchmark tasks involving continuous control of simulated robots. We show improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms in performance and robustness to hyperparameters, outperforming DDPG in 5 out of 6 evaluation environments and showing no decrease in performance with TD3, which is known to be relatively stable. In this way, our approach takes an important step towards increasing data efficiency and stability in training for real-world robotic applications.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), instability can arise during training due to factors such as stochasticity in the environment or algorithmic components.

This work aims to fill that gap by analyzing the behavior of popular RL algorithms under different levels of environmental instability, exploring their ability to learn and converge over time. We find that even simple methods like adding noise to action outputs or randomizing network parameters can significantly improve stability and final performance. Our results provide new insights into RL instability recovery, providing practical guidance for researchers and practitioners alike.

"Current end-to-end deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches require jointly learning perception, decision-making and low-level control from very sparse reward signals and high-dimensional inputs, with little capability of incorporating prior knowledge. This results in prohibitively long training times for use on real-world robotic tasks. Existing algorithms capable of extracting task-level representations from high-dimensional inputs, e.g. object detection, often produce outputs of varying lengths, restricting their use in RL methods due to the need for neural networks to have fixed length inputs. In this work, we propose a framework that combines deep sets encoding, which allows for variable-length abstract representations, with modular RL that utilizes these representations, decoupling high-level decision making from low-level control. We successfully demonstrate our approach on the robot manipulation task of object sorting, showing that this method can learn effective policies within mere minutes of highly simplified simulation. The learned policies can be directly deployed on a robot without further training, and generalize to variations of the task unseen during training.",0

How might you write an abstract like this? Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using simulated environments to train robots due to their lower cost and reduced risk compared to physical experimentation. However, existing work on simulation-to-real transfer focuses mainly on tasks involving fixed action sequences or low-level control policies, whereas many high-value tasks require variable length inputs such as natural language instructions or human demonstrations. We propose a novel approach that utilizes deep reinforcement learning techniques and imitation learning from expert demonstrations, enabling robots to effectively handle variable length inputs during both training and testing phases in simulations. Our method enables successful transfer of learned behaviors across different scenarios without fine-tuning or modification, achieving better generalization capabilities than previous methods. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmark tasks in both simulation and reality, demonstrating improved performance and robustness even under noisy or incomplete input conditions.

"Stochastic games provide a framework for interactions among multiple agents and enable a myriad of applications. In these games, agents decide on actions simultaneously, the state of every agent moves to the next state, and each agent receives a reward. However, finding an equilibrium (if exists) in this game is often difficult when the number of agents becomes large. This paper focuses on finding a mean-field equilibrium (MFE) in an action coupled stochastic game setting in an episodic framework. It is assumed that the impact of the other agents' can be assumed by the empirical distribution of the mean of the actions. All agents know the action distribution and employ lower-myopic best response dynamics to choose the optimal oblivious strategy. This paper proposes a posterior sampling based approach for reinforcement learning in the mean-field game, where each agent samples a transition probability from the previous transitions. We show that the policy and action distributions converge to the optimal oblivious strategy and the limiting distribution, respectively, which constitute an MFE.",0
"Title: ""Reinforcement learning for mean field games""  Abstract: In recent years, mean field games have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling large-scale stochastic systems with interactions among heterogeneous agents. These games involve multiple players making decisions based on their individual preferences and beliefs, while taking into account the aggregate behavior of the entire population. However, solving mean field games is often challenging due to the complex interactions and nonlinearities involved. This paper presents a new reinforcement learning approach for finding approximate solutions to mean field games with general payoff functions and dynamics. Our method relies on deep neural networks to represent the value function of each player, which captures both local interactions and global effects. We show that our algorithm converges efficiently to locally optimal policies under mild assumptions, using only Monte Carlo sampling for simulation and estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for various settings, including congestion control problems, crowd evacuation scenarios, and traffic flow models. Overall, our work provides a flexible and scalable solution for tackling dynamic mean field games in real-world applications.",1
"TorchBeast is a platform for reinforcement learning (RL) research in PyTorch. It implements a version of the popular IMPALA algorithm for fast, asynchronous, parallel training of RL agents. Additionally, TorchBeast has simplicity as an explicit design goal: We provide both a pure-Python implementation (""MonoBeast"") as well as a multi-machine high-performance version (""PolyBeast""). In the latter, parts of the implementation are written in C++, but all parts pertaining to machine learning are kept in simple Python using PyTorch, with the environments provided using the OpenAI Gym interface. This enables researchers to conduct scalable RL research using TorchBeast without any programming knowledge beyond Python and PyTorch. In this paper, we describe the TorchBeast design principles and implementation and demonstrate that it performs on-par with IMPALA on Atari.

"In this paper, we aim to develop a simple and scalable reinforcement learning algorithm that uses standard supervised learning methods as subroutines. Our goal is an algorithm that utilizes only simple and convergent maximum likelihood loss functions, while also being able to leverage off-policy data. Our proposed approach, which we refer to as advantage-weighted regression (AWR), consists of two standard supervised learning steps: one to regress onto target values for a value function, and another to regress onto weighted target actions for the policy. The method is simple and general, can accommodate continuous and discrete actions, and can be implemented in just a few lines of code on top of standard supervised learning methods. We provide a theoretical motivation for AWR and analyze its properties when incorporating off-policy data from experience replay. We evaluate AWR on a suite of standard OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to a number of well-established state-of-the-art RL algorithms. AWR is also able to acquire more effective policies than most off-policy algorithms when learning from purely static datasets with no additional environmental interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate our algorithm on challenging continuous control tasks with highly complex simulated characters.",0
"This paper proposes a new method for off-policy reinforcement learning called advantage-weighted regression (AWR). AWR is a simple and scalable algorithm that uses advantage estimates to weight updates based on their expected importance for improving policy performance. By using advantages instead of raw rewards, AWR can more accurately capture the quality of policies and directly optimize the expected return. Our approach has two key benefits: first, it requires minimal hyperparameter tuning since weights are computed automatically from the dataset; second, our algorithm naturally handles continuous actions without needing to discretize them as done by most other methods. We evaluate our approach across several benchmark domains and compare against state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that AWR consistently achieves high levels of performance while requiring less computation compared to alternatives. Overall, we demonstrate that AWR is an effective solution for off-policy RL problems, particularly for those seeking simplicity and scalability.",1
"Many (but not all) approaches self-qualifying as ""meta-learning"" in deep learning and reinforcement learning fit a common pattern of approximating the solution to a nested optimization problem. In this paper, we give a formalization of this shared pattern, which we call GIMLI, prove its general requirements, and derive a general-purpose algorithm for implementing similar approaches. Based on this analysis and algorithm, we describe a library of our design, higher, which we share with the community to assist and enable future research into these kinds of meta-learning approaches. We end the paper by showcasing the practical applications of this framework and library through illustrative experiments and ablation studies which they facilitate.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in meta-learning, which involves training models that can learn from prior experience to improve their performance on new tasks. Many successful approaches have been proposed, including MAML, Reptile, and SNAIL. However, these methods typically assume that the inner loop optimization used during adaptation already produces good solutions. When this assumption fails, such as when using slow gradient-based algorithms like SGD or Adam in deep learning problems, the resulting meta-learner may perform poorly. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized framework called Inner Loop Adaptive Learning (iLA). This approach adapts the model during meta-training by optimizing the parameters controlling the learner's perplexity, loss, or other metrics. Additionally, iLA uses techniques such as early stopping based on validation set accuracy to prevent overfitting and control the amount of adaptation performed. Experimental results across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art meta-learning approaches. Our work provides insights into improving the robustness of meta-learning systems, particularly in situations where standard assumptions do not hold.",1
"Generalization and adaptation of learned skills to novel situations is a core requirement for intelligent autonomous robots. Although contextual reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for learning and generalization of behaviors across related tasks, it generally relies on uninformed sampling of environments from an unknown, uncontrolled context distribution, thus missing the benefits of structured, sequential learning. We introduce a novel relative entropy reinforcement learning algorithm that gives the agent the freedom to control the intermediate task distribution, allowing for its gradual progression towards the target context distribution. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed curriculum learning scheme drastically improves sample efficiency and enables learning in scenarios with both broad and sharp target context distributions in which classical approaches perform sub-optimally.",0

"With the advents of deep learning, improved image classification with complex discriminative models has been made possible. However, such deep models with increased complexity require a huge set of labeled samples to generalize the training. Such classification models can easily overfit when applied for medical images because of limited training data, which is a common problem in the field of medical image analysis. This paper proposes and investigates a reinforced classifier for improving the generalization under a few available training data. Partially following the idea of reinforcement learning, the proposed classifier uses a generalization-feedback from a subset of the training data to update its parameter instead of only using the conventional cross-entropy loss about the training data. We evaluate the improvement of the proposed classifier by applying it on three different classification problems against the standard deep classifiers equipped with existing overfitting-prevention techniques. Besides an overall improvement in classification performance, the proposed classifier showed remarkable characteristics of generalized learning, which can have great potential in medical classification tasks.",0
"Title: ""Reinforcing Medical Image Classifier to Improve Generalization on Small Datasets""  Abstract: Medical image classification plays a critical role in automating diagnosis and treatment decisions. However, medical datasets can often be limited in size, which may lead to overfitting in machine learning models trained on these datasets. Overfitting results in poor generalization performance of the model on unseen data. To address this issue, we propose using reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method uses RL to find optimal hyperparameters that improve generalization performance on small datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art methods and show that our proposed technique achieves better generalization performance across multiple benchmark datasets. This study contributes towards improving the accuracy and reliability of AI-based systems used in healthcare applications.",1
"In recent studies on model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), incorporating uncertainty in forward dynamics is a state-of-the-art strategy to enhance learning performance, making MBRLs competitive to cutting-edge model free methods, especially in simulated robotics tasks. Probabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling (PETS) is a leading type of MBRL, which employs Bayesian inference to dynamics modeling and model predictive control (MPC) with stochastic optimization via the cross entropy method (CEM). In this paper, we propose a novel extension to the uncertainty-aware MBRL. Our main contributions are twofold: Firstly, we introduce a variational inference MPC, which reformulates various stochastic methods, including CEM, in a Bayesian fashion. Secondly, we propose a novel instance of the framework, called probabilistic action ensembles with trajectory sampling (PaETS). As a result, our Bayesian MBRL can involve multimodal uncertainties both in dynamics and optimal trajectories. In comparison to PETS, our method consistently improves asymptotic performance on several challenging locomotion tasks.",0
"In recent years, model predictive control (MPC) has emerged as a promising approach to reinforcement learning due to its ability to balance optimization performance against constraint satisfaction and feasibility. However, many real-world systems have uncertain parameters that need to be learned through data collection, making standard methods such as MPC unsuitable for these environments. This paper proposes variational inference MPC (ViMPC), which combines Gaussian processes with variational Bayesian approximation techniques to allow for scalable sequential decision-making under uncertainty. ViMPC uses an ensemble of inducing points to approximate the posterior distribution over possible functions, enabling efficient optimization that can handle nonlinearities. Our method improves upon traditional approaches by ensuring feasible closed-loop behaviors while optimizing expected return, even with limited data availability. Experimental results on simulated examples demonstrate ViMPC's effectiveness and superiority compared to existing alternatives. This work advances the state-of-the-art in Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning, providing new tools for designing controllers for complex systems operating in uncertain environments.",1
"We present a model-based framework for robot locomotion that achieves walking based on only 4.5 minutes (45,000 control steps) of data collected on a quadruped robot. To accurately model the robot's dynamics over a long horizon, we introduce a loss function that tracks the model's prediction over multiple timesteps. We adapt model predictive control to account for planning latency, which allows the learned model to be used for real time control. Additionally, to ensure safe exploration during model learning, we embed prior knowledge of leg trajectories into the action space. The resulting system achieves fast and robust locomotion. Unlike model-free methods, which optimize for a particular task, our planner can use the same learned dynamics for various tasks, simply by changing the reward function. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is more than an order of magnitude more sample efficient than current model-free methods.",0
"This paper presents a new method for training legged robots using reinforcement learning that requires significantly less data than previous methods. We use a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as our base learner and propose several modifications to reduce the amount of data required. Our first modification is to add an offline buffer to store previously collected experiences so that the agent can learn from them during subsequent interactions with the environment. Next, we introduce a novel form of reward shaping where the robot receives additional rewards for achieving specific behaviors such as standing up, walking forward, etc., which helps guide the agent towards solving complex tasks more quickly. Finally, we show that adding random noise to both state observations and action choices improves robustness and reduces overfitting on limited amounts of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations of a quadruped robot navigating various terrains and obstacles. Our results show that our proposed modifications greatly improve performance compared to standard PPO, requiring only half the number of episodes to reach the same level of success. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of combining deep reinforcement learning algorithms with data efficient techniques for training legged robots.",1
"We propose a new aggregation framework for approximate dynamic programming, which provides a connection with rollout algorithms, approximate policy iteration, and other single and multistep lookahead methods. The central novel characteristic is the use of a bias function $V$ of the state, which biases the values of the aggregate cost function towards their correct levels. The classical aggregation framework is obtained when $V\equiv0$, but our scheme works best when $V$ is a known reasonably good approximation to the optimal cost function $J^*$.   When $V$ is equal to the cost function $J_{\mu}$ of some known policy $\mu$ and there is only one aggregate state, our scheme is equivalent to the rollout algorithm based on $\mu$ (i.e., the result of a single policy improvement starting with the policy $\mu$). When $V=J_{\mu}$ and there are multiple aggregate states, our aggregation approach can be used as a more powerful form of improvement of $\mu$. Thus, when combined with an approximate policy evaluation scheme, our approach can form the basis for a new and enhanced form of approximate policy iteration.   When $V$ is a generic bias function, our scheme is equivalent to approximation in value space with lookahead function equal to $V$ plus a local correction within each aggregate state. The local correction levels are obtained by solving a low-dimensional aggregate DP problem, yielding an arbitrarily close approximation to $J^*$, when the number of aggregate states is sufficiently large. Except for the bias function, the aggregate DP problem is similar to the one of the classical aggregation framework, and its algorithmic solution by simulation or other methods is nearly identical to one for classical aggregation, assuming values of $V$ are available when needed.",0
"This paper proposes new algorithms that leverage biases during both the aggregation of experiences collected by multiple agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL), as well as the rollouts used in policy improvement. We first propose a method called biased aggregation, which modifies traditional experience collection and aggregation mechanisms used by RL algorithms so they can effectively use task-specific domain knowledge in order to maximize their performance. Our approach uses two types of biases: prioritized bias that emphasizes high value transitions, and focused bias that emphasizes high similarity transitions with other agents. We show how our method can significantly outperform existing methods in different domains while using less data, and we provide theoretical insights into why this happens. Next, we introduce enhanced policy improvement, which integrates these biases directly into the rollout phase. By doing so, our algorithm achieves more efficient use of computation resources compared to standard policy improvement methods such as REINFORCE. Finally, we extend our framework to support communication among agents and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations on challenging teamwork tasks, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work shows that incorporating appropriate biases at every stage of the learning process is essential for improved multi-agent RL performance.",1
"Efficient dispatching rule in manufacturing industry is key to ensure product on-time delivery and minimum past-due and inventory cost. Manufacturing, especially in the developed world, is moving towards on-demand manufacturing meaning a high mix, low volume product mix. This requires efficient dispatching that can work in dynamic and stochastic environments, meaning it allows for quick response to new orders received and can work over a disparate set of shop floor settings. In this paper we address this problem of dispatching in manufacturing. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a new design to formulate the shop floor state as a 2-D matrix, incorporate job slack time into state representation, and design lateness and tardiness rewards function for dispatching purpose. However, maintaining a separate RL model for each production line on a manufacturing shop floor is costly and often infeasible. To address this, we enhance our deep RL model with an approach for dispatching policy transfer. This increases policy generalization and saves time and cost for model training and data collection. Experiments show that: (1) our approach performs the best in terms of total discounted reward and average lateness, tardiness, (2) the proposed policy transfer approach reduces training time and increases policy generalization.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly popular as a methodology for solving sequential decision making problems. One such problem that can benefit from RL algorithms is the manufacturing dispatching problem, where a scheduler must decide which jobs should be assigned to machines in order to maximize efficiency while accounting for real-world constraints such as machine availability, job processing times, and scheduling deadlines. To tackle this complex task, we propose a novel approach combining both RL and transfer learning techniques. Our proposed algorithm first learns to solve simpler versions of the manufacturing dispatching problem by transferring knowledge from pretrained models on similar tasks. This allows our algorithm to quickly adapt and learn efficient policies for the new scenario at hand. Then, we apply RL to optimize these learned policies and further improve performance through trial and error. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm using numerical simulations based on real-world data and show promising results outperforming other baseline methods. By leveraging both transfer learning and RL, we demonstrate how artificial intelligence can effectively tackle complex and dynamic decision making problems encountered in modern industries.",1
"Experimentally, it has been observed that humans and animals often make decisions that do not maximize their expected utility, but rather choose outcomes randomly, with probability proportional to expected utility. Probability matching, as this strategy is called, is equivalent to maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL). However, MaxEnt RL does not optimize expected utility. In this paper, we formally show that MaxEnt RL does optimally solve certain classes of control problems with variability in the reward function. In particular, we show (1) that MaxEnt RL can be used to solve a certain class of POMDPs, and (2) that MaxEnt RL is equivalent to a two-player game where an adversary chooses the reward function. These results suggest a deeper connection between MaxEnt RL, robust control, and POMDPs, and provide insight for the types of problems for which we might expect MaxEnt RL to produce effective solutions. Specifically, our results suggest that domains with uncertainty in the task goal may be especially well-suited for MaxEnt RL methods.",0
"This is a difficult question to answer because there aren't yet many papers that use entropy as a loss function instead of negative log likelihood. There have been some recent explorations along these lines by OpenAI and others (e.g., Lowe et al., ICML 2023; Achiam et al., ICLR 2022), but they don't provide a clear framework to decide whether to choose maxent vs neglogloss vs other options. Instead, we focus on clarifying one aspect of the issue: how maxent compares to neglogloss at optimality and near-optimality. We define ""optimal"" as reaching a local minimum that finds all policies within a neighborhood of size epsilon (smaller than the learning rate).  Our main finding is simple: while near-optimality may favor neglogloss over maxent, the opposite occurs at true optimality. Thus, even if we accept the claim that low neglogloss = good policy / low risk, our results show two problems: 1) current reinforcement learning algorithms like SAC may often find non-optimal solutions (i.e., true minima); thus, their use leads to suboptimal behavior unless the algorithm can guarantee finding global optima; 2) the relationship between neglogloss, entropy, and error is complex and depends on factors beyond just choice of loss function: it varies both depending on model architecture AND environment structure!  Therefore, it seems unlikely to simply pick one loss function over another without considering additional details specific to each problem, which highlights the importance of understanding the tradeoffs involved in any ML application. Our paper thus offers something unique compared to prior work: although we can neither fully answer nor resolve these questions due to theoretical limitations (we cannot exhaustively study a generalization gap for every possible MDP!), we clarify what type of problem might favor which type of objective, rather than leaving open the possibility o",1
"Graph representation learning, aiming to learn low-dimensional representations which capture the geometric dependencies between nodes in the original graph, has gained increasing popularity in a variety of graph analysis tasks, including node classification and link prediction. Existing representation learning methods based on graph neural networks and their variants rely on the aggregation of neighborhood information, which makes it sensitive to noises in the graph. In this paper, we propose Graph Denoising Policy Network (short for GDPNet) to learn robust representations from noisy graph data through reinforcement learning. GDPNet first selects signal neighborhoods for each node, and then aggregates the information from the selected neighborhoods to learn node representations for the down-stream tasks. Specifically, in the signal neighborhood selection phase, GDPNet optimizes the neighborhood for each target node by formulating the process of removing noisy neighborhoods as a Markov decision process and learning a policy with task-specific rewards received from the representation learning phase. In the representation learning phase, GDPNet aggregates features from signal neighbors to generate node representations for down-stream tasks, and provides task-specific rewards to the signal neighbor selection phase. These two phases are jointly trained to select optimal sets of neighbors for target nodes with maximum cumulative task-specific rewards, and to learn robust representations for nodes. Experimental results on node classification task demonstrate the effectiveness of GDNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods on several well-studied datasets. Additionally, GDPNet is mathematically equivalent to solving the submodular maximizing problem, which theoretically guarantees the best approximation to the optimal solution with GDPNet.",0
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data structures such as graphs, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on numerous tasks. However, despite their successes, GNNs can still suffer from overfitting due to their reliance on fragile representations that may easily collapse under small perturbations in the input data. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new denoising policy network architecture designed to learn robust representations through adversarial training using random edge dropping in the underlying graph structure. Our approach encourages the model to generalize better by enforcing regularization against strong dropout noise while maintaining competitive accuracy on clean test sets compared to standard fine-tuning techniques. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness across several benchmark datasets and task settings in the domain of computer vision, with promising results indicating significant improvements in robustness without sacrificing performance.",1
"Widely-used deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to fail in the batch setting--learning from a fixed data set without interaction with the environment. Following this result, there have been several papers showing reasonable performances under a variety of environments and batch settings. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of recent off-policy and batch reinforcement learning algorithms under unified settings on the Atari domain, with data generated by a single partially-trained behavioral policy. We find that under these conditions, many of these algorithms underperform DQN trained online with the same amount of data, as well as the partially-trained behavioral policy. To introduce a strong baseline, we adapt the Batch-Constrained Q-learning algorithm to a discrete-action setting, and show it outperforms all existing algorithms at this task.",0

"Prior work on training generative Visual Dialog models with reinforcement learning(Das et al.) has explored a Qbot-Abot image-guessing game and shown that this 'self-talk' approach can lead to improved performance at the downstream dialog-conditioned image-guessing task. However, this improvement saturates and starts degrading after a few rounds of interaction, and does not lead to a better Visual Dialog model. We find that this is due in part to repeated interactions between Qbot and Abot during self-talk, which are not informative with respect to the image. To improve this, we devise a simple auxiliary objective that incentivizes Qbot to ask diverse questions, thus reducing repetitions and in turn enabling Abot to explore a larger state space during RL ie. be exposed to more visual concepts to talk about, and varied questions to answer. We evaluate our approach via a host of automatic metrics and human studies, and demonstrate that it leads to better dialog, ie. dialog that is more diverse (ie. less repetitive), consistent (ie. has fewer conflicting exchanges), fluent (ie. more human-like),and detailed, while still being comparably image-relevant as prior work and ablations.",0
"In natural language processing (NLP), generative visual dialog systems seek to generate responses that are both semantically accurate and visually grounded. However, current state-of-the-art methods often struggle with generating diverse answers that cover multiple aspects of a given query. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on pre-training techniques. Our model uses self-supervised learning from large datasets to learn robust features that can capture diverse semantic concepts within images. This allows our system to better predict more complete sets of relevant keywords related to each image, which can then be used to guide response generation. We evaluate our method using metrics such as perplexity, diversity scores, and human judgments, and show significant improvement over baseline models on all measures. Our results indicate that our method is effective at improving the quality and diversity of generated responses in visual dialog tasks. Overall, these findings have important implications for advancing research in NLP towards more human-like and adaptive conversational agents.",1

While existing literature has examined the convergence properties and numerical stability of these methods, less attention has been paid to understanding their sensitivity to initial conditions and model uncertainties. This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the variance of policy gradient estimators for LQR under different parameter settings, and investigating how uncertainty affects the quality of the estimated policies. By shedding light on the sources and magnitude of this variance, we aim to contribute towards improving the accuracy and robustness of deep RL methods for controlling complex systems.",1
"Robotics has proved to be an indispensable tool in many industrial as well as social applications, such as warehouse automation, manufacturing, disaster robotics, etc. In most of these scenarios, damage to the agent while accomplishing mission-critical tasks can result in failure. To enable robotic adaptation in such situations, the agent needs to adopt policies which are robust to a diverse set of damages and must do so with minimum computational complexity. We thus propose a damage aware control architecture which diagnoses the damage prior to gait selection while also incorporating domain randomization in the damage space for learning a robust policy. To implement damage awareness, we have used a Long Short Term Memory based supervised learning network which diagnoses the damage and predicts the type of damage. The main novelty of this approach is that only a single policy is trained to adapt against a wide variety of damages and the diagnosis is done in a single trial at the time of damage.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotics tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However, there remains a critical gap in applying DRL to real-world robots that operate in uncertain and dynamically changing environments, where they may encounter various forms of damage and degradation. This work addresses the challenge of diagnosing damages in robots and adapting their behavior to continue operating optimally in spite of the impairment. We propose two novel algorithms based on single-shot imitation learning from human demonstrations: one for accurate damage detection and another for adaptation during execution. Experimental evaluation shows that both methods achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to prior art across several benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under dynamic conditions. These results highlight the promise of DRL for enabling efficient and effective operation of robots even after suffering significant breakdowns.

"We investigate using reinforcement learning agents as generative models of images (extending arXiv:1804.01118). A generative agent controls a simulated painting environment, and is trained with rewards provided by a discriminator network simultaneously trained to assess the realism of the agent's samples, either unconditional or reconstructions. Compared to prior work, we make a number of improvements to the architectures of the agents and discriminators that lead to intriguing and at times surprising results. We find that when sufficiently constrained, generative agents can learn to produce images with a degree of visual abstraction, despite having only ever seen real photographs (no human brush strokes). And given enough time with the painting environment, they can produce images with considerable realism. These results show that, under the right circumstances, some aspects of human drawing can emerge from simulated embodiment, without the need for external supervision, imitation or social cues. Finally, we note the framework's potential for use in creative applications.",0

"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is used to infer the reward function from the actions of an expert running a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A novel approach using variational inference for learning the reward function is proposed in this research. Using this technique, the intractable posterior distribution of the continuous latent variable (the reward function in this case) is analytically approximated to appear to be as close to the prior belief while trying to reconstruct the future state conditioned on the current state and action. The reward function is derived using a well-known deep generative model known as Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE) with Wasserstein loss function, thus referred to as Conditional Wasserstein Auto-encoder-IRL (CWAE-IRL), which can be analyzed as a combination of the backward and forward inference. This can then form an efficient alternative to the previous approaches to IRL while having no knowledge of the system dynamics of the agent. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as objectworld and pendulum show that the proposed algorithm can effectively learn the latent reward function in complex, high-dimensional environments.",0

"In this paper, we study the problem of image recognition with non-differentiable constraints. A lot of real-life recognition applications require a rich output structure with deterministic constraints that are discrete or modeled by a non-differentiable function. A prime example is recognizing digit sequences, which are restricted by such rules (e.g., \textit{container code detection}, \textit{social insurance number recognition}, etc.). We investigate the usefulness of adding non-differentiable constraints in learning for the task of digit sequence recognition. Toward this goal, we synthesize six different datasets from MNIST and Cropped SVHN, with three discrete rules inspired by real-life protocols. To deal with the non-differentiability of these rules, we propose a reinforcement learning approach based on the policy gradient method. We find that incorporating this rule-based reinforcement can effectively increase the accuracy for all datasets and provide a good inductive bias which improves the model even with limited data. On one of the datasets, MNIST\_Rule2, models trained with rule-based reinforcement increase the accuracy by 4.7\% for 2000 samples and 23.6\% for 500 samples. We further test our model against synthesized adversarial examples, e.g., blocking out digits, and observe that adding our rule-based reinforcement increases the model robustness with a relatively smaller performance drop.",0

In this paper, we suggest a method that achieves the first success in both challenges for robot/machine scheduling problems.   Our method comprises of three components. First, we show a robot scheduling problem can be expressed as a random probabilistic graphical model (PGM). We develop a mean-field inference method for random PGM and use it for Q-function inference. Second, we show that transferability can be achieved by carefully designing two-step sequential encoding of problem state. Third, we resolve the computational scalability issue of fitted Q-iteration by suggesting a heuristic auction-based Q-iteration fitting method enabled by transferability we achieved.   We apply our method to discrete-time, discrete space problems (Multi-Robot Reward Collection (MRRC)) and scalably achieve 97% optimality with transferability. This optimality is maintained under stochastic contexts. By extending our method to continuous time, continuous space formulation, we claim to be the first learning-based method with scalable performance among multi-machine scheduling problems; our method scalability achieves comparable performance to popular metaheuristics in Identical parallel machine scheduling (IPMS) problems.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing algorithms that can efficiently assign tasks to multiple robots or machines in real-time scenarios where the goals and constraints change over time. One approach to solving this problem involves using graph theory and machine learning techniques to model the task relationships and develop optimal solutions. However, most existing methods suffer from either high computational complexity or lack of adaptability to dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel method called GraphEmbedPlanner that combines graph embedding with efficient search algorithms to achieve fast and effective multi-robot/machine sequence assignment planning under uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of speed, quality, and robustness in both simulation and real-world testbeds, making it a promising solution for large-scale coordinated robotics applications.",1
"This study investigates the use of reinforcement learning to guide a general purpose cache manager decisions. Cache managers directly impact the overall performance of computer systems. They govern decisions about which objects should be cached, the duration they should be cached for, and decides on which objects to evict from the cache if it is full. These three decisions impact both the cache hit rate and size of the storage that is needed to achieve that cache hit rate. An optimal cache manager will avoid unnecessary operations, maximise the cache hit rate which results in fewer round trips to a slower backend storage system, and minimise the size of storage needed to achieve a high hit-rate.   This project investigates using reinforcement learning in cache management by designing three separate agents for each of the cache manager tasks. Furthermore, the project investigates two advanced reinforcement learning architectures for multi-decision problems: a single multi-task agent and a multi-agent. We also introduce a framework to simplify the modelling of computer systems problems as a reinforcement learning task. The framework abstracts delayed experiences observations and reward assignment in computer systems while providing a flexible way to scale to multiple agents.   Simulation results based on an established database benchmark system show that reinforcement learning agents can achieve a higher cache hit rate over heuristic driven algorithms while minimising the needed space. They are also able to adapt to a changing workload and dynamically adjust their caching strategy accordingly. The proposed cache manager model is generic and applicable to other types of caches, such as file system caches. This project is the first, to our knowledge, to model cache manager decisions as a multi-task control problem.",0
"Here we present RLCache, a novel approach to automate cache management using reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional methods rely on rule-based policies that are limited by human understanding of system behavior and can lead to suboptimal performance. In contrast, our method uses deep Q-learning, a type of model-free RL algorithm, to learn a cache management policy directly from observed system data without relying on rules or heuristics. Our experiments show that RLCache significantly improves hit rates and reduces miss rate over state-of-the-art rule-based policies across multiple workloads, including microbenchmarks and real-world applications such as Apache Spark and Pandas/NumPy. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that RLCache identifies and exploits complex temporal correlations among access patterns that are difficult for humans to capture manually. These results demonstrate the promise of leveraging machine learning techniques like RL to tackle challenging problems in computer systems.",1
"The common pipeline in autonomous driving systems is highly modular and includes a perception component which extracts lists of surrounding objects and passes these lists to a high-level decision component. In this case, leveraging the benefits of deep reinforcement learning for high-level decision making requires special architectures to deal with multiple variable-length sequences of different object types, such as vehicles, lanes or traffic signs. At the same time, the architecture has to be able to cover interactions between traffic participants in order to find the optimal action to be taken. In this work, we propose the novel Deep Scenes architecture, that can learn complex interaction-aware scene representations based on extensions of either 1) Deep Sets or 2) Graph Convolutional Networks. We present the Graph-Q and DeepScene-Q off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms, both outperforming state-of-the-art methods in evaluations with the publicly available traffic simulator SUMO.",0
"Incorporating sensorimotor interaction dynamics into scene understanding is crucial for autonomous driving, as it helps agents reason about agent-environment interactions, potential future states, and decision making. However, current approaches largely ignore dynamic interaction, focusing on static environment representation or solely modeling human motion predictions without considering the underlying physical relationships between motion trajectories and environmental features. We propose a novel approach, called DIAS (Dynamic Interaction-aware Scene understanding), which unifies multimodal perception and dynamic interaction reasoning under one framework. DIAS models temporal coherence across different sensory modalities and integrates interaction patterns based on physics laws, enabling comprehensive scene analysis that captures both short-term motions and longer-range plans. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over prior methods in diverse tasks such as object detection, tracking, and intention prediction for autonomous vehicles operating in complex scenarios. Additionally, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results in two large benchmark datasets widely used for testing self-driving systems while providing interpretable explanations through interactive visualizations. This work paves the way towards realizing robust scene understanding that tightly couples sensor data processing with action planning for safe and efficient autonomous driving experiences.",1
"Instability and slowness are two main problems in deep reinforcement learning. Even if proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the state of the art, it still suffers from these two problems. We introduce an improved algorithm based on proximal policy optimization, mixed distributed proximal policy optimization (MDPPO), and show that it can accelerate and stabilize the training process. In our algorithm, multiple different policies train simultaneously and each of them controls several identical agents that interact with environments. Actions are sampled by each policy separately as usual, but the trajectories for the training process are collected from all agents, instead of only one policy. We find that if we choose some auxiliary trajectories elaborately to train policies, the algorithm will be more stable and quicker to converge especially in the environments with sparse rewards.",0
"Machine learning has made significant advances in recent years due in large part to the development of new algorithms that enable more efficient training on massive datasets. One such algorithm is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which combines model-free reinforcement learning with trust region methods. PPO has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of problems, including Atari games and MuJoCo locomotion tasks.  In this work, we explore the use of mixed distributed training for improving the efficiency of PPO. In contrast to prior work that relies exclusively on synchronous parallelism or asynchronous updates across multiple devices, our method allows for a flexible combination of these two modes during optimization. We demonstrate through experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks that this approach can significantly reduce training times while maintaining comparable performance to standard single-device implementations.  The key insight behind our framework is that different phases of the optimization process may benefit from different levels of asynchrony. For example, early stages typically require low variance gradient estimates to converge quickly, whereas later stages might tolerate higher variances if they result in faster convergence overall. By dynamically switching between synchronous and asynchronous modes based on current progress, we are able to leverage the strengths of each paradigm without introducing additional complexity into the algorithm itself.  Overall, our work shows the potential benefits of incorporating mixed distributed training techniques within existing machine learning frameworks like PPO. While further investigation is warranted, we believe that this research direction holds great promise for accelerating the pace of ML innovation by enabling even larger and more complex models to be trained on available hardware resources.",1
"Traffic signal control has long been considered as a critical topic in intelligent transportation systems. Most existing learning methods mainly focus on isolated intersections and suffer from inefficient training. This paper aims at the cooperative control for large scale multi-intersection traffic signal, in which a novel end-to-end learning based model is established and the efficient training method is proposed correspondingly. In the proposed model, the input traffic status in multi-intersections is represented by a tensor, which not only significantly reduces dimensionality than using a single matrix but also avoids information loss. For the output, a multidimensional boolean vector is employed for the control policy to indicate whether the signal state changes or not, which simplifies the representation and abides the practical phase changing rules. In the proposed model, a multi-task learning structure is used to get the cooperative policy by learning. Instead of only using the reinforcement learning to train the model, we employ imitation learning to integrate a rule based model with neural networks to do the pre-training, which provides a reliable and satisfactory stage solution and greatly accelerates the convergence. Afterwards, the reinforcement learning method is adopted to continue the fine training, where proximal policy optimization algorithm is incorporated to solve the policy collapse problem in multi-dimensional output situation. In numerical experiments, the advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated with comparison to the related state-of-the-art methods.",0
"An optimal traffic signal control system that coordinates multiple intersections simultaneously can significantly improve the efficiency and safety of urban transportation networks. This study proposes a novel approach based on tensor-based cooperative control using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL). In our method, we first develop a multi-agent DQL framework by utilizing a low rank plus sparse decomposition model to capture both local and global interactions among neighboring intersections. Then, we integrate the learned Q-values into an actor-critic network structure, which enables scalability while ensuring stability during policy updates. To further enhance the robustness and adaptability of the trained agents, we introduce IL from expert human demonstrations in addition to pure RL training. Our experimental evaluation results demonstrate significant improvement in terms of average delay reduction compared to existing methods such as CACC, Adaptive Cruise Control and NGSIM simulations. Additionally, human subject experiments reveal user acceptance and satisfaction of the proposed cooperative control system. These findings suggest the promising potential of tensory-based cooperative control techniques in real-world applications for large scale multi-intersection traffic signal management systems.",1
"As integrated circuits have become progressively more complex, constrained random stimulus has become ubiquitous as a means of stimulating a designs functionality and ensuring it fully meets expectations. In theory, random stimulus allows all possible combinations to be exercised given enough time, but in practice with highly complex designs a purely random approach will have difficulty in exercising all possible combinations in a timely fashion. As a result it is often necessary to steer the Design Verification (DV) environment to generate hard to hit combinations. The resulting constrained-random approach is powerful but often relies on extensive human expertise to guide the DV environment in order to fully exercise the design. As designs become more complex, the guidance aspect becomes progressively more challenging and time consuming often resulting in design schedules in which the verification time to hit all possible design coverage points is the dominant schedule limitation. This paper describes an approach which leverages existing constrained-random DV environment tools but which further enhances them using supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques. This approach provides better than random results in a highly automated fashion thereby ensuring DV objectives of full design coverage can be achieved on an accelerated timescale and with fewer resources.   Two hardware verification examples are presented, one of a Cache Controller design and one using the open-source RISCV-Ariane design and Google's RISCV Random Instruction Generator. We demonstrate that a machine-learning based approach can perform significantly better on functional coverage and reaching complex hard-to-hit states than a random or constrained-random approach.",0
"In modern chip design verification processes, engineers typically rely on random test pattern generation (RTPG) techniques to ensure that their designs are free from bugs. However, such methods often lead to suboptimal results due to their inherent limitations in exploring all possible scenarios in a reasonable time frame. This research proposes a novel approach based on machine learning algorithms that can optimize design verification by generating more efficient and effective test patterns. Through extensive simulations, we show how our proposed method significantly outperforms RTPG in terms of bug detection rate while requiring fewer test patterns and execution time. Our findings demonstrate the potential of applying machine learning techniques to enhance traditional verification practices, ultimately leading to improved reliability and performance in modern electronic designs.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and graph classification. Recent researches show that graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which deliberately add carefully created unnoticeable perturbation to the graph structure. The perturbation is usually created by adding/deleting a few edges, which might be noticeable even when the number of edges modified is small. In this paper, we propose a graph rewiring operation which affects the graph in a less noticeable way compared to adding/deleting edges. We then use reinforcement learning to learn the attack strategy based on the proposed rewiring operation. Experiments on real world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To understand the proposed framework, we further analyze how its generated perturbation to the graph structure affects the output of the target model.",0
"Adversarial attacks on graph convolutional networks (GCN) have recently become a topic of interest due to their wide applicability in many domains such as social network analysis, computer vision, natural language processing, etc. While there exist several studies that focus on generating adversarial examples against GCNs by adding noise to input features, very few works consider attacks based on modifying the underlying graph structure itself. In this work, we present a novel attack approach aimed at rewiring edges in the graph to cause misclassification of nodes, which can potentially lead to significant damage, especially in applications where confidentiality or integrity of data is important. We evaluate our method using both synthetic graphs and real-world datasets from different application areas and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving high success rates while maintaining low detection probabilities. Our results highlight the vulnerability of GCNs to structural modifications and emphasize the need for further research towards developing more robust models and countermeasures against these types of attacks.",1
"In this paper we derive an efficient method for computing the indices associated with an asymptotically optimal upper confidence bound algorithm (MDP-UCB) of Burnetas and Katehakis (1997) that only requires solving a system of two non-linear equations with two unknowns, irrespective of the cardinality of the state space of the Markovian decision process (MDP). In addition, we develop a similar acceleration for computing the indices for the MDP-Deterministic Minimum Empirical Divergence (MDP-DMED) algorithm developed in Cowan et al. (2019), based on ideas from Honda and Takemura (2011), that involves solving a single equation of one variable. We provide experimental results demonstrating the computational time savings and regret performance of these algorithms. In these comparison we also consider the Optimistic Linear Programming (OLP) algorithm (Tewari and Bartlett, 2008) and a method based on Posterior sampling (MDP-PS).",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing efficient algorithms for computing the upper confidence bound (UCB) and related indices used in reinforcement learning. These quantities play a crucial role in many RL algorithms as they allow agents to balance exploration and exploitation while making decisions. However, their computation can become prohibitively expensive in large scale problems, which limits the applicability of such methods. This work addresses this issue by proposing novel techniques for accelerating the calculation of UCB and related indices. We develop new closed form expressions that greatly simplify these computations, leading to significant speedups across a range of environments. Our approach applies to both tabular representation of policies and value functions, as well as continuous spaces where function approximation is required. Empirical results show that our method leads to substantial improvements over existing approaches in terms of computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Overall, our contributions significantly advance the state of the art in acceleration techniques for UCB and related indices in RL, paving the way for more scalable solutions in larger domains.",1
"We consider the networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem in a fully decentralized setting, where agents learn to coordinate to achieve the joint success. This problem is widely encountered in many areas including traffic control, distributed control, and smart grids. We assume that the reward function for each agent can be different and observed only locally by the agent itself. Furthermore, each agent is located at a node of a communication network and can exchanges information only with its neighbors. Using softmax temporal consistency and a decentralized optimization method, we obtain a principled and data-efficient iterative algorithm. In the first step of each iteration, an agent computes its local policy and value gradients and then updates only policy parameters. In the second step, the agent propagates to its neighbors the messages based on its value function and then updates its own value function. Hence we name the algorithm value propagation. We prove a non-asymptotic convergence rate 1/T with the nonlinear function approximation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first MARL algorithm with convergence guarantee in the control, off-policy and non-linear function approximation setting. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in experiments.",0
This paper describes the problem and proposed approach for value propagation for decentralized networked deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL). We focus on how agents can share their experiences in order to learn from each other without compromising individual privacy. Our solution uses a distributed optimization algorithm that allows agents to locally store their own experience buffer while sharing only summary statistics across the network. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves both sample efficiency and overall performance over standard single agent RL methods.,1
"Although deep reinforcement learning agents have produced impressive results in many domains, their decision making is difficult to explain to humans. To address this problem, past work has mainly focused on explaining why an action was chosen in a given state. A different type of explanation that is useful is a counterfactual, which deals with ""what if?"" scenarios. In this work, we introduce the concept of a counterfactual state to help humans gain a better understanding of what would need to change (minimally) in an Atari game image for the agent to choose a different action. We introduce a novel method to create counterfactual states from a generative deep learning architecture. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of counterfactual states on human participants who are not machine learning experts. Our user study results suggest that our generated counterfactual states are useful in helping non-expert participants gain a better understanding of an agent's decision making process.",0
"Exploring counterfactual states can provide valuable insights into decision making processes and help optimize policies in reinforcement learning. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to generate plausible alternatives that could have led to different outcomes. This paper presents a method to create counterfactual versions of Atari games using generative models, allowing agents to explore hypothetical situations that may lead to better decisions and improved performance. We evaluate our approach on several Atari games and show that agents trained with counterfactuals achieve higher rewards compared to those without access to such information. Our work contributes to the growing field of explainability in deep learning by providing an interpretable tool that helps identify key factors underlying agent behavior. By incorporating these counterfactual representations, we enable more human-like reasoning and decision making in artificial intelligence systems.",1
"There have been numerous advances in reinforcement learning, but the typically unconstrained exploration of the learning process prevents the adoption of these methods in many safety critical applications. Recent work in safe reinforcement learning uses idealized models to achieve their guarantees, but these models do not easily accommodate the stochasticity or high-dimensionality of real world systems. We investigate how prediction provides a general and intuitive framework to constraint exploration, and show how it can be used to safely learn intersection handling behaviors on an autonomous vehicle.",0
"In recent years reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training autonomous systems. Despite promising results, current approaches face significant safety challenges due to their reliance on trial-and-error during training, which can lead to harmful or unintended actions. This work proposes a safe reinforcement learning framework that addresses these concerns by explicitly considering safety constraints during both training and execution. Our approach builds upon recent advances in constrained policy search methods while ensuring robustness against unseen scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive simulations and physical experiments using real-world robots. The proposed framework represents a step towards reliable robotic systems that operate safely alongside humans and make decisions under uncertainty.",1
"Improving sample efficiency has been a longstanding goal in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose the $\mathtt{VRMPO}$: a sample efficient policy gradient method with stochastic mirror descent. A novel variance reduced policy gradient estimator is the key of $\mathtt{VRMPO}$ to improve sample efficiency. Our $\mathtt{VRMPO}$ needs only $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ sample trajectories to achieve an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point, which matches the best-known sample complexity. We conduct extensive experiments to show our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art policy gradient methods in various settings.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to policy optimization using stochastic mirror descent (SMD). SMD has been shown to be effective at finding optimal policies in reinforcement learning tasks, but traditional implementations can be sensitive to hyperparameter choices and may converge slowly. Our proposed method addresses these issues by introducing randomness into the gradient updates and adaptively adjusting the step size based on the current state of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and experiments on several benchmark problems, including both discrete and continuous action spaces. Compared to existing methods, our approach achieves faster convergence and better performance across a range of settings. Overall, we believe that SMD is a powerful tool for policy optimization and that our contributions will be valuable to researchers working in reinforcement learning and related fields.",1
"Policy gradient based reinforcement learning algorithms coupled with neural networks have shown success in learning complex policies in the model free continuous action space control setting. However, explicitly parameterized policies are limited by the scope of the chosen parametric probability distribution. We show that alternatively to the likelihood based policy gradient, a related objective can be optimized through advantage weighted quantile regression. Our approach models the policy implicitly in the network, which gives the agent the freedom to approximate any distribution in each action dimension, not limiting its capabilities to the commonly used unimodal Gaussian parameterization. This broader spectrum of policies makes our algorithm suitable for problems where Gaussian policies cannot fit the optimal policy. Moreover, our results on the MuJoCo physics simulator benchmarks are comparable or superior to state-of-the-art on-policy methods.",0
"Policy search algorithms have recently emerged as popular alternatives to traditional model-based reinforcement learning methods, due to their ability to efficiently explore complex environments without requiring explicit models of transition dynamics. However, these policies often struggle with finding effective behavior in high-dimensional state spaces, where local optimization procedures tend to suffer from poor convergence rates and sensitivity to initialization. In this work, we propose a new approach based on quantile regression that addresses these issues by directly estimating upper and lower bounds on policy performance across different regions of state space. Our method integrates policy search and function approximation in a novel manner, enabling efficient exploration of large action spaces while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees of converging to near-optimal solutions under mild assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique using a range of benchmark control tasks, including both continuous and discrete action settings, showing consistent improvements over existing approaches. Overall, this research offers a valuable contribution towards developing more robust and scalable solution methods for real-world decision making problems under uncertainty.",1
"In this paper, we aim to tackle the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation across a sequence of frames where only the ground-truth segmentation of the first frame is provided. The challenges lie in how to online update the segmentation model initialized from the first frame adaptively and accurately, even in presence of multiple confusing instances or large object motion. The existing approaches rely on selecting the region of interest for model update, which however, is rough and inflexible, leading to performance degradation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach which utilizes reinforcement learning to select optimal adaptation areas for each frame, based on the historical segmentation information. The RL model learns to take optimal actions to adjust the region of interest inferred from the previous frame for online model updating. To speed up the model adaption, we further design a novel multi-branch tree based exploration method to fast select the best state action pairs. Our experiments show that our work improves the state-of-the-art of the mean region similarity on DAVIS 2016 dataset to 87.1%.",0
"In this paper, we present an adaptive approach to generating region of interest (ROI) masks for video object segmentation using reinforcement learning.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness against changes in camera motion and lighting conditions. The use of reinforcement learning allows for flexible adaptation to dynamic environments, making our approach well suited for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotic vision.",1
"A fundamental question in reinforcement learning is whether model-free algorithms are sample efficient. Recently, Jin et al. \cite{jin2018q} proposed a Q-learning algorithm with UCB exploration policy, and proved it has nearly optimal regret bound for finite-horizon episodic MDP. In this paper, we adapt Q-learning with UCB-exploration bonus to infinite-horizon MDP with discounted rewards \emph{without} accessing a generative model. We show that the \textit{sample complexity of exploration} of our algorithm is bounded by $\tilde{O}({\frac{SA}{\epsilon^2(1-\gamma)^7}})$. This improves the previously best known result of $\tilde{O}({\frac{SA}{\epsilon^4(1-\gamma)^8}})$ in this setting achieved by delayed Q-learning \cite{strehl2006pac}, and matches the lower bound in terms of $\epsilon$ as well as $S$ and $A$ except for logarithmic factors.",0

"Understanding black-box machine learning models is important towards their widespread adoption. However, developing globally interpretable models that explain the behavior of the entire model is challenging. An alternative approach is to explain black-box models through explaining individual prediction using a locally interpretable model. In this paper, we propose a novel method for locally interpretable modeling - Reinforcement Learning-based Locally Interpretable Modeling (RL-LIM). RL-LIM employs reinforcement learning to select a small number of samples and distill the black-box model prediction into a low-capacity locally interpretable model. Training is guided with a reward that is obtained directly by measuring agreement of the predictions from the locally interpretable model with the black-box model. RL-LIM near-matches the overall prediction performance of black-box models while yielding human-like interpretability, and significantly outperforms state of the art locally interpretable models in terms of overall prediction performance and fidelity.",0
"In recent years, the field of machine learning has seen significant advancements due to the development of advanced techniques such as deep neural networks (DNNs). These models have achieved impressive performance on a variety of tasks; however, they suffer from a fundamental limitation: their lack of interpretability. This means that while DNNs can make accurate predictions, they struggle to provide insight into how these decisions were reached, which makes them difficult to trust and adopt by practitioners outside of academia. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called RL-LIM (Reinforcement Learning-based Locally Interpretable Modelling), which combines reinforcement learning with local interpretable modeling to balance predictive accuracy and interpretability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on real-world datasets across several application domains including image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

RecSim allows the creation of new environments that reflect particular aspects of user behavior and item structure at a level of abstraction well-suited to pushing the limits of current reinforcement learning (RL) and RS techniques in sequential interactive recommendation problems. Environments can be easily configured that vary assumptions about: user preferences and item familiarity; user latent state and its dynamics; and choice models and other user response behavior. We outline how RecSim offers value to RL and RS researchers and practitioners, and how it can serve as a vehicle for academic-industrial collaboration.",0

"Estimating the predictive uncertainty of a Bayesian learning model is critical in various decision-making problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, detecting adversarial attack, self-driving car. As the model posterior is almost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate approximation the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model posterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the predictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is to use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large number of samples, evaluate the model repeatedly and average multiple model outputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this work, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained, we propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability distribution induced by model posterior with a parameterized model and in an amortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the true uncertainty of a specific Bayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at testing time. The proposed method is universally applicable to Bayesian classification models that allow for posterior sampling. Theoretically, we show that the idea of amortization incurs no additional costs on approximation performance. Empirical results validate the strong practical performance of our approach.",0
"This paper presents an innovative approach to accelerating Monte Carlo Bayesian inference by approximating predictive uncertainty using the simplex method. The traditional method of computing predictive uncertainty can be computationally expensive and time consuming, making it challenging to obtain accurate results within a reasonable timeframe. Our proposed method leverages the simplicity of the simplex method to efficiently approximate predictive uncertainty, enabling faster and more effective Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on real data sets, which show that our method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high levels of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work has important implications for applied researchers who rely on Monte Carlo simulation techniques to make informed decisions in a variety of fields such as finance, economics, engineering, and healthcare.",1
"Learning to imitate expert behavior from demonstrations can be challenging, especially in environments with high-dimensional, continuous observations and unknown dynamics. Supervised learning methods based on behavioral cloning (BC) suffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates demonstrated actions, it can drift away from demonstrated states due to error accumulation. Recent methods based on reinforcement learning (RL), such as inverse RL and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), overcome this issue by training an RL agent to match the demonstrations over a long horizon. Since the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods learn a reward function from the demonstrations, often using complex and brittle approximation techniques that involve adversarial training. We propose a simple alternative that still uses RL, but does not require learning a reward function. The key idea is to provide the agent with an incentive to match the demonstrations over a long horizon, by encouraging it to return to demonstrated states upon encountering new, out-of-distribution states. We accomplish this by giving the agent a constant reward of r=+1 for matching the demonstrated action in a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r=0 for all other behavior. Our method, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), can be implemented with a handful of minor modifications to any standard Q-learning or off-policy actor-critic algorithm. Theoretically, we show that SQIL can be interpreted as a regularized variant of BC that uses a sparsity prior to encourage long-horizon imitation. Empirically, we show that SQIL outperforms BC and achieves competitive results compared to GAIL, on a variety of image-based and low-dimensional tasks in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo.",0
"In order to learn from sparse rewards, imitation learning algorithms must rely on either exploration strategies that balance exploitation of known solutions with random behavior, or they can use intrinsic motivation methods such as curiosity-driven learning or autonomous goal generation to encourage exploration towards achieving goals specified by human priors. However, these approaches often require manual engineering of complex reward functions or rely heavily on heuristics to specify meaningful goals for agents. To address these issues, we propose using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize agent behaviors directly according to human preferences over trajectories, rather than optimizing for task objectives derived solely based on human-provided rewards. Our approach uses the Successor State Representation (SSR), which has been shown to capture high-level features of tasks while remaining compact enough for efficient optimization. We train our model using human preference judgements obtained through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Using several benchmark problems, including classic control tasks such as Mountain Car and Lunar Lander, as well as more recent environments like Solomonoff Domains and Pixel World, we show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms, especially those without access to dense rewards, even though only 5% of the states were labeled. Finally, we conduct an ablation study analyzing different components of our framework and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component individually. This work provides evidence that RL can effectively discover complex policies directly from human preferences over trajectories, allowing for improved performance on both benchmarks and real-world applications where sparse rewards are commonplace.",1
"Quantifying the value of data is a fundamental problem in machine learning. Data valuation has multiple important use cases: (1) building insights about the learning task, (2) domain adaptation, (3) corrupted sample discovery, and (4) robust learning. To adaptively learn data values jointly with the target task predictor model, we propose a meta learning framework which we name Data Valuation using Reinforcement Learning (DVRL). We employ a data value estimator (modeled by a deep neural network) to learn how likely each datum is used in training of the predictor model. We train the data value estimator using a reinforcement signal of the reward obtained on a small validation set that reflects performance on the target task. We demonstrate that DVRL yields superior data value estimates compared to alternative methods across different types of datasets and in a diverse set of application scenarios. The corrupted sample discovery performance of DVRL is close to optimal in many regimes (i.e. as if the noisy samples were known apriori), and for domain adaptation and robust learning DVRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art by 14.6% and 10.8%, respectively.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to data valuation by utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). We propose using RL to learn how different pieces of data can contribute positively or negatively to specific business outcomes, which allows us to calculate their value. By integrating historical transactional and behavioral datasets, we create customized models that capture unique patterns from each customer interaction dataset. Our model then leverages these interactions as examples for our RL agent to determine the appropriate outcome based on user choices. Ultimately, our method provides a more accurate and dynamic estimation of data value that aligns closely with real business metrics.

"Imitation learning seeks to learn an expert policy from sampled demonstrations. However, in the real world, it is often difficult to find a perfect expert and avoiding dangerous behaviors becomes relevant for safety reasons. We present the idea of \textit{learning to avoid}, an objective opposite to imitation learning in some sense, where an agent learns to avoid a demonstrator policy given an environment. We define avoidance learning as the process of optimizing the agent's reward while avoiding dangerous behaviors given by a demonstrator. In this work we develop a framework of avoidance learning by defining a suitable objective function for these problems which involves the \emph{distance} of state occupancy distributions of the expert and demonstrator policies. We use density estimates for state occupancy measures and use the aforementioned distance as the reward bonus for avoiding the demonstrator. We validate our theory with experiments using a wide range of partially observable environments. Experimental results show that we are able to improve sample efficiency during training compared to state of the art policy optimization and safety methods.",0

"The ability to discover approximately optimal policies in domains with sparse rewards is crucial to applying reinforcement learning (RL) in many real-world scenarios. Approaches such as neural density models and continuous exploration (e.g., Go-Explore) have been proposed to maintain the high exploration rate necessary to find high performing and generalizable policies. Soft actor-critic(SAC) is another method for improving exploration that aims to combine efficient learning via off-policy updates while maximizing the policy entropy. In this work, we extend SAC to a richer class of probability distributions (e.g., multimodal) through normalizing flows (NF) and show that this significantly improves performance by accelerating the discovery of good policies while using much smaller policy representations. Our approach, which we call SAC-NF, is a simple, efficient,easy-to-implement modification and improvement to SAC on continuous control baselines such as MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool domains. Finally, SAC-NF does this while being significantly parameter efficient, using as few as 5.5% the parameters for an equivalent SAC model.",0
"This paper presents a method for improving off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms by leveraging normalizing flows to transform state representations into denser distributions that can better capture uncertainty and improve exploration. We first introduce a novel algorithm called the Density Ratio Exploration Policy (DREP) which uses the density ratio of two state distributions as a measure of exploratory behavior. We then use normalizing flows to learn a mapping from the original state representation to a new space where state visitation probabilities are uniform under some conditions, enabling us to efficiently optimize for our exploration criteria. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark environments and show that DREP significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both sample efficiency and final performance. Our results highlight the potential benefits of using normalizing flows for improving exploration in off-policy RL algorithms.",1
"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are increasingly large and complex to achieve the best possible accuracy. In this paper, we build an AutoML system that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the per-layer compression ratios when applied to a state-of-the-art attention based end-to-end ASR model composed of several LSTM layers. We use singular value decomposition (SVD) low-rank matrix factorization as the compression method. For our RL-based AutoML system, we focus on practical considerations such as the choice of the reward/punishment functions, the formation of an effective search space, and the creation of a representative but small data set for quick evaluation between search steps. Finally, we present accuracy results on LibriSpeech of the model compressed by our AutoML system, and we compare it to manually-compressed models. Our results show that in the absence of retraining our RL-based search is an effective and practical method to compress a production-grade ASR system. When retraining is possible, we show that our AutoML system can select better highly-compressed seed models compared to manually hand-crafted rank selection, thus allowing for more compression than previously possible.",0
"Abstract:  Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across many domains, including speech recognition, image classification, and natural language processing. However, these large models often require significant computational resources, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices such as smartphones, embedded systems, and IoT sensors. In this work, we present a novel approach for compressing deep neural networks using reinforcement learning techniques. Our method, called ShrinkML, can be applied end-to-end to any automatic speech recognition (ASR) model architecture and achieves significantly better compression ratios compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, we show that our compressed models achieve comparable or even slightly improved accuracy than their uncompressed counterparts while reducing memory footprint by up to 70%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in enabling deployment of high-quality ASR systems on limited hardware resources. This has important implications for broadening access to advanced technologies beyond well-resourced research labs and data centers. Overall, our contributions represent a step forward toward realizing the vision of ubiquitous intelligent machines, capable of interacting naturally with humans anywhere at any time.",1
"Since the recent advent of deep reinforcement learning for game play and simulated robotic control, a multitude of new algorithms have flourished. Most are model-free algorithms which can be categorized into three families: deep Q-learning, policy gradients, and Q-value policy gradients. These have developed along separate lines of research, such that few, if any, code bases incorporate all three kinds. Yet these algorithms share a great depth of common deep reinforcement learning machinery. We are pleased to share rlpyt, which implements all three algorithm families on top of a shared, optimized infrastructure, in a single repository.

"One typical assumption in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is that human experts act to optimize the expected utility of a stochastic cost with a fixed distribution. This assumption deviates from actual human behaviors under ambiguity. Risk-sensitive inverse reinforcement learning (RS-IRL) bridges such gap by assuming that humans act according to a random cost with respect to a set of subjectively distorted distributions instead of a fixed one. Such assumption provides the additional flexibility to model human's risk preferences, represented by a risk envelope, in safe-critical tasks. However, like other learning from demonstration techniques, RS-IRL could also suffer inefficient learning due to redundant demonstrations. Inspired by the concept of active learning, this research derives a probabilistic disturbance sampling scheme to enable an RS-IRL agent to query expert support that is likely to expose unrevealed boundaries of the expert's risk envelope. Experimental results confirm that our approach accelerates the convergence of RS-IRL algorithms with lower variance while still guaranteeing unbiased convergence.",0
"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover reward functions that explain observed human behavior. However, most existing IRL algorithms assume that the agent can take arbitrary actions without incurring any risk or cost. In reality, agents often face constraints on their action space due to safety concerns or limited resources. This paper proposes a novel framework for active learning in risk-sensitive inverse reinforcement learning (RSIRL), which allows an agent to learn a consistent reward function while taking into account constraints imposed by risk measures such as expected cumulative costs or violation probabilities. Our approach utilizes robust optimization techniques to handle uncertain environments and integrates Monte Carlo sampling methods to reduce the number of interactions required. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional IRL approaches in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness on benchmark problems. Overall, our work paves the way towards more realistic and effective inverse reinforcement learning models capable of navigating complex scenarios under uncertainty.",1
"Traffic congestion in metropolitan areas is a world-wide problem that can be ameliorated by traffic lights that respond dynamically to real-time conditions. Recent studies applying deep reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize single traffic lights have shown significant improvement over conventional control. However, optimization of global traffic condition over a large road network fundamentally is a cooperative multi-agent control problem, for which single-agent RL is not suitable due to environment non-stationarity and infeasibility of optimizing over an exponential joint-action space. Motivated by these challenges, we propose QCOMBO, a simple yet effective multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that combines the advantages of independent and centralized learning. We ensure scalability by selecting actions from individually optimized utility functions, which are shaped to maximize global performance via a novel consistency regularization loss between individual utility and a global action-value function. Experiments on diverse road topologies and traffic flow conditions in the SUMO traffic simulator show competitive performance of QCOMBO versus recent state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. We further show that policies trained on small sub-networks can effectively generalize to larger networks under different traffic flow conditions, providing empirical evidence for the suitability of MARL for intelligent traffic control.",0
"Optimizing traffic signal networks can improve urban mobility and reduce congestion. Traditional approaches have relied on either centralized systems that require complete knowledge of the entire network or decentralized systems that lack coordination among intersections. This study proposes integrating both independent and centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms to enhance decision making at individual intersections while coordinating their actions across the network. Our approach uses both global and local value functions for each agent and combines them using a weighted sum method. We evaluate our framework through simulation experiments under different traffic scenarios. Results show improved overall performance compared to existing methods, demonstrating the potential of integrated MARL approaches for optimizing complex traffic signal networks. Implications for future research and real-world applications are discussed.",1
"An important linear algebra routine, GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM), is a fundamental operator in deep learning. Compilers need to translate these routines into low-level code optimized for specific hardware. Compiler-level optimization of GEMM has significant performance impact on training and executing deep learning models. However, most deep learning frameworks rely on hardware-specific operator libraries in which GEMM optimization has been mostly achieved by manual tuning, which restricts the performance on different target hardware. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms for GEMM optimization based on the TVM framework, a lightweight Greedy Best First Search (G-BFS) method based on heuristic search, and a Neighborhood Actor Advantage Critic (N-A2C) method based on reinforcement learning. Experimental results show significant performance improvement of the proposed methods, in both the optimality of the solution and the cost of search in terms of time and fraction of the search space explored. Specifically, the proposed methods achieve 24% and 40% savings in GEMM computation time over state-of-the-art XGBoost and RNN methods, respectively, while exploring only 0.1% of the search space. The proposed approaches have potential to be applied to other operator-level optimizations.",0

"Incorporate at least four of the following five keywords: deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, machine learning (ML). Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly progressed over the past few decades thanks to advances in Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as Neural Networks (NN), which have been used to tackle complex real-world problems in fields like Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recently, there has been growing interest in developing new methods that can further improve model performance by leveraging powerful hardware resources such as GPUs and TPUs. One promising direction is to use randomization during training to explore the solution space more effectively and find better optima. This approach has shown great successes in many domains ranging from playing games like Go and Atari to generative models for images, text, and speech synthesis. This paper proposes a novel algorithmic framework called ""DeepExplore"" for optimizing objectives specified as black boxes and using random values functions for exploring the search space efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three challenging tasks that span across different ML subfields: NLP, CV, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our experiments show consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines in all settings, highlighting the strong potential of our proposed approach. Furthermore, we provide insights into how randomization helps speed up convergence rates and reduce risk of getting stuck in local minima common in high dimensional spaces. Our work makes contributions towards bridging gaps between existing research on RL with function approximation and that on continuous optimization wi",1
"Gradient-based methods for optimisation of objectives in stochastic settings with unknown or intractable dynamics require estimators of derivatives. We derive an objective that, under automatic differentiation, produces low-variance unbiased estimators of derivatives at any order. Our objective is compatible with arbitrary advantage estimators, which allows the control of the bias and variance of any-order derivatives when using function approximation. Furthermore, we propose a method to trade off bias and variance of higher order derivatives by discounting the impact of more distant causal dependencies. We demonstrate the correctness and utility of our objective in analytically tractable MDPs and in meta-reinforcement-learning for continuous control.",0
"This paper addresses a critical problem faced by reinforcement learning agents operating in stochastic environments: trading off bias and variance in score function estimators.

Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Loaded DiCE across several challenging domains. In summary, this work represents a significant advance in understanding the role of bias and variance in RL and provides new insights into designing efficient algorithms for real-world applications.",1
"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning algorithms have successfully been applied to temporal credit assignment problems with sparse reward signals. However, state-of-the-art algorithms require manual specification of sub-task structures, a sample inefficient exploration phase or lack semantic interpretability. Humans, on the other hand, efficiently detect hierarchical sub-structures induced by their surroundings. It has been argued that this inference process universally applies to language, logical reasoning as well as motor control. Therefore, we propose a cognitive-inspired Reinforcement Learning architecture which uses grammar induction to identify sub-goal policies. By treating an on-policy trajectory as a sentence sampled from the policy-conditioned language of the environment, we identify hierarchical constituents with the help of unsupervised grammatical inference. The resulting set of temporal abstractions is called action grammar (Pastra & Aloimonos, 2012) and unifies symbolic and connectionist approaches to Reinforcement Learning. It can be used to facilitate efficient imitation, transfer and online learning.",0
"Effective human exploration, learning, and decision making is commonly facilitated by the use of hierarchies and abstraction. This work seeks to incorporate these features into reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained with deep neural networks, allowing them to learn more data-efficiently from their interactions with complex environments. Building on prior work that has used semantic action grammars in RL to enable compositional generalization, we propose using action grammars in conjunction with recent advances in self-supervised pretraining to improve agent performance across a wide range of tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to baseline methods and show that agents trained with action grammars learn substantially faster and perform better than those without. These findings have important implications for real world applications of AI systems trained via RL, including robotics, healthcare, and education.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of achieving sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key difficulty in reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the agent to optimize. Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to overcome this problem. Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend to require that demonstrations are supplied in the first-person: the agent is provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting first-person demonstrations. Humans address this problem by learning from third-person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same task themselves.   In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation learning. Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve a simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and unsupervised refers to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states. Our methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain confusion can be utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial during the training process. To validate our approach, we report successful experiments on learning from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain, a reacher domain, and inverted pendulum.",0
"Abstract:  The ability to imitate others is crucial for effective social interaction and learning new skills. Previous research has primarily focused on first-person imitation learning, where individuals learn by observing their own movements or those of another individual from a shared perspective. However, third-party (or observer) perspectives can provide additional context and details that may enhance the effectiveness of imitation learning. In this study, we examined the role of third-person imitation learning and how it relates to both performance improvements and neural activity patterns. We found that engaging in third-person imitation leads to better performance compared to other methods of observation, such as passive viewing or rehearsal without action execution. Additionally, neuroimaging results revealed distinct brain activation patterns during different types of observation. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering multiple perspectives during the imitation process and highlight the neural mechanisms involved in third-person imitation learning. Our work contributes to our understanding of social cognition and provides insights into potential applications of imitation learning across various fields.",1
"In this paper we investigate two hypothesis regarding the use of deep reinforcement learning in multiple tasks. The first hypothesis is driven by the question of whether a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, trained on two similar tasks, is able to outperform two single-task, individually trained algorithms, by more efficiently learning a new, similar task, that none of the three algorithms has encountered before. The second hypothesis is driven by the question of whether the same multi-task deep RL algorithm, trained on two similar tasks and augmented with elastic weight consolidation (EWC), is able to retain similar performance on the new task, as a similar algorithm without EWC, whilst being able to overcome catastrophic forgetting in the two previous tasks. We show that a multi-task Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (GA3C) algorithm, trained on Space Invaders and Demon Attack, is in fact able to outperform two single-tasks GA3C versions, trained individually for each single-task, when evaluated on a new, third task, namely, Phoenix. We also show that, when training two trained multi-task GA3C algorithms on the third task, if one is augmented with EWC, it is not only able to achieve similar performance on the new task, but also capable of overcoming a substantial amount of catastrophic forgetting on the two previous tasks.",0
"In continual reinforcement learning (CRL), agents must learn multiple tasks sequentially while retaining previously acquired knowledge. One major challenge of CRL is catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task leads to rapid degradation of performance on previous tasks. To overcome this issue, multi-task learning techniques have been proposed which allow the agent to share knowledge across multiple tasks. However, using these methods may lead to negative transfer, where learned skills are transferred poorly or even detrimental to new tasks. This work investigates the impact of different multi-task learning algorithms and regularization methods on preventing both catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer in CRL. We present several novel insights into the behavior of these algorithms and their tradeoffs. Our experiments demonstrate that carefully chosen combinations of algorithm components can achieve strong zero-shot performance across many tasks without suffering from either problem.",1
"The ability to navigate from visual observations in unfamiliar environments is a core component of intelligent agents and an ongoing challenge for Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Street View can be a sensible testbed for such RL agents, because it provides real-world photographic imagery at ground level, with diverse street appearances; it has been made into an interactive environment called StreetLearn and used for research on navigation. However, goal-driven street navigation agents have not so far been able to transfer to unseen areas without extensive retraining, and relying on simulation is not a scalable solution. Since aerial images are easily and globally accessible, we propose instead to train a multi-modal policy on ground and aerial views, then transfer the ground view policy to unseen (target) parts of the city by utilizing aerial view observations. Our core idea is to pair the ground view with an aerial view and to learn a joint policy that is transferable across views. We achieve this by learning a similar embedding space for both views, distilling the policy across views and dropping out visual modalities. We further reformulate the transfer learning paradigm into three stages: 1) cross-modal training, when the agent is initially trained on multiple city regions, 2) aerial view-only adaptation to a new area, when the agent is adapted to a held-out region using only the easily obtainable aerial view, and 3) ground view-only transfer, when the agent is tested on navigation tasks on unseen ground views, without aerial imagery. Experimental results suggest that the proposed cross-view policy learning enables better generalization of the agent and allows for more effective transfer to unseen environments.",0
"This is an interesting topic that has received significant attention from researchers in recent years due to advances in deep learning and computer vision technologies. The goal of cross-view policy learning (CVPL) is to develop algorithms that can learn navigation policies from multiple views of real streets without having access to any ground truth labels. These algorithms should be able to generalize well across different street scenes and traffic conditions and adapt to new situations quickly. In addition, they must also take into account important factors such as safety and efficiency when making decisions about where to navigate next. Existing methods have shown promising results but there is still room for improvement, especially when it comes to handling occlusions caused by buildings, pedestrians, and other obstacles. Our work seeks to address these challenges and advance the state of art in CVPL. We propose a novel method based on convolutional neural networks trained with adversarial loss functions that learns robust representations for navigation tasks even under adverse environmental conditions. Experiments conducted using large scale publicly available datasets demonstrate improved performance compared against baseline approaches.

We present an approach that combines self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning to effectively transfer negative samples into positive ones and change the reward distribution. We demonstrate the benefits of our painting agent to reproduce reference images with brush strokes. The training phase takes about one hour and the runtime algorithm takes about 30 seconds on a GTX1080 GPU reproducing a 1000x800 image with 20,000 strokes.",0

"The learning rate is one of the most important hyper-parameters for model training and generalization. However, current hand-designed parametric learning rate schedules offer limited flexibility and the predefined schedule may not match the training dynamics of high dimensional and non-convex optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based framework that can automatically learn an adaptive learning rate schedule by leveraging the information from past training histories. The learning rate dynamically changes based on the current training dynamics. To validate this framework, we conduct experiments with different neural network architectures on the Fashion MINIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Experimental results show that the auto-learned learning rate controller can achieve better test results. In addition, the trained controller network is generalizable -- able to be trained on one data set and transferred to new problems.",0

"The use of target networks has been a popular and key component of recent deep Q-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning, yet little is known from the theory side. In this work, we introduce a new family of target-based temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms and provide theoretical analysis on their convergences. In contrast to the standard TD-learning, target-based TD algorithms maintain two separate learning parameters-the target variable and online variable. Particularly, we introduce three members in the family, called the averaging TD, double TD, and periodic TD, where the target variable is updated through an averaging, symmetric, or periodic fashion, mirroring those techniques used in deep Q-learning practice.   We establish asymptotic convergence analyses for both averaging TD and double TD and a finite sample analysis for periodic TD. In addition, we also provide some simulation results showing potentially superior convergence of these target-based TD algorithms compared to the standard TD-learning. While this work focuses on linear function approximation and policy evaluation setting, we consider this as a meaningful step towards the theoretical understanding of deep Q-learning variants with target networks.",0
"Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning has been widely used as a computational model for reinforcement learning tasks. In recent years, target-based methods have emerged as a promising approach to improve TD learning by updating targets online based on the latest estimate of the value function. This paper presents a novel algorithm called Target-Based Temporal Difference Learning (TBTDL), which combines both temporal difference and target-based updates into one framework.  Our proposed method addresses several limitations of existing target-based algorithms while maintaining their key benefits such as stability, efficiency, and flexibility in choosing update schedules. We introduce an adaptive mechanism that adjusts the frequency and magnitude of target updates based on the convergence rate of the estimated values. Our simulation results show that TBTDL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across multiple domains, including grid world problems, continuous control problems, and complex realistic environments like Atari games.  To conclude, we believe that our work represents an important step towards better understanding the intricacies of TD learning algorithms and provides insights that can inform future research in the field of deep reinforcement learning.

"We propose a planning and perception mechanism for a robot (agent), that can only observe the underlying environment partially, in order to solve an image classification problem. A three-layer architecture is suggested that consists of a meta-layer that decides the intermediate goals, an action-layer that selects local actions as the agent navigates towards a goal, and a classification-layer that evaluates the reward and makes a prediction. We design and implement these layers using deep reinforcement learning. A generalized policy gradient algorithm is utilized to learn the parameters of these layers to maximize the expected reward. Our proposed methodology is tested on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which provides us with a level of explainability while interpreting the agent's intermediate goals and course of action.",0
"Title: ""A Layered Architecture for Active Perception"" Authors: John Smith (Author), Mary Jones(Author) Abstract In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing computer vision systems capable of active perception - that is, selecting actions based on incomplete observations to maximize their expected cumulative reward. This task presents unique challenges, as environments often contain multiple, interrelated sources of uncertainty which must be actively resolved through sequential decision making. To address these issues, we propose a novel layered architecture for active perception consisting of a hierarchical mixture of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. At each level of our hierarchy, we employ a deep neural network trained via policy gradient methods to select actions based on partial environmental observations. These actions are then executed by lower levels in the hierarchy until a suitable solution to the current ambiguity is found. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art passive classifiers across a variety of benchmark image classification tasks, providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of active perception strategies.

"Practical reinforcement learning problems are often formulated as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problems, in which the agent has to maximize the expected return while satisfying a set of prescribed safety constraints. In this study, we propose a novel simulator-based method to approximately solve a CMDP problem without making any compromise on the safety constraints. We achieve this by decomposing the CMDP into a pair of MDPs; reconnaissance MDP and planning MDP. The purpose of reconnaissance MDP is to evaluate the set of actions that are safe, and the purpose of planning MDP is to maximize the return while using the actions authorized by reconnaissance MDP. RMDP can define a set of safe policies for any given set of safety constraint, and this set of safe policies can be used to solve another CMDP problem with different reward. Our method is not only computationally less demanding than the previous simulator-based approaches to CMDP, but also capable of finding a competitive reward-seeking policy in a high dimensional environment, including those involving multiple moving obstacles.",0

"In tabular case, when the reward and environment dynamics are known, policy evaluation can be written as $\bm{V}_{\bm{\pi}} = (I - \gamma P_{\bm{\pi}})^{-1} \bm{r}_{\bm{\pi}}$, where $P_{\bm{\pi}}$ is the state transition matrix given policy ${\bm{\pi}}$ and $\bm{r}_{\bm{\pi}}$ is the reward signal given ${\bm{\pi}}$. What annoys us is that $P_{\bm{\pi}}$ and $\bm{r}_{\bm{\pi}}$ are both mixed with ${\bm{\pi}}$, which means every time when we update ${\bm{\pi}}$, they will change together. In this paper, we leverage the notation from \cite{wang2007dual} to disentangle ${\bm{\pi}}$ and environment dynamics which makes optimization over policy more straightforward. We show that policy gradient theorem \cite{sutton2018reinforcement} and TRPO \cite{schulman2015trust} can be put into a more general framework and such notation has good potential to be extended to model-based reinforcement learning.",0
"In recent years, policy optimization has become increasingly important as many real world decision making problems can be modeled using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Various algorithms have been developed to solve these MDPs, including value iteration, policy improvement, Q-Learning, SARSA, and more. However, most existing work on policy optimization relies on tabular representation of transition probability matrices which require huge memory space. This becomes challenging when the state spaces grow large or continuous, leading to scalability issues. To overcome this limitation, we revisit policy optimization using matrix form representations, where the matrix contains all possible transitions from each state. We propose novel approaches that leverage linear algebra techniques and exploit structural properties of MDPs to efficiently optimize policies in this framework. Our methods achieve provably sublinear regret bounds and are empirically evaluated across several benchmark domains, demonstrating significant performance improvements over prior art. Overall, our work provides new tools and insights into solving complex reinforcement learning tasks in high dimensional settings.",1
"One desirable capability of autonomous cars is to accurately predict the pedestrian motion near intersections for safe and efficient trajectory planning. We are interested in developing transfer learning algorithms that can be trained on the pedestrian trajectories collected at one intersection and yet still provide accurate predictions of the trajectories at another, previously unseen intersection. We first discussed the feature selection for transferable pedestrian motion models in general. Following this discussion, we developed one transferable pedestrian motion prediction algorithm based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that infers pedestrian intentions and predicts future trajectories based on observed trajectory. We evaluated our algorithm on a dataset collected at two intersections, trained at one intersection and tested at the other intersection. We used the accuracy of augmented semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC), trained and tested at the same intersection as a baseline. The result shows that the proposed algorithm improves the baseline accuracy by 40% in the non-transfer task, and 16% in the transfer task.",0
"""Motor vehicles often operate alongside pedestrians on roads; as such, accurately predicting their future paths can make road intersections safer for all parties involved. This study focuses on developing transferable models that can forecast the movement trajectories of pedestrians using existing data gathered from sensors installed along walkways. To validate these models, field tests were conducted across multiple locations worldwide with varying factors influencing human behavior, including weather conditions, time of day, and cultural differences. Results show high accuracy and versatility: our approach can learn from data collected in one environment and then apply it to other regions without significant degradation in performance.""",1
"In the last decade many different algorithms have been proposed to track a generic object in videos. Their execution on recent large-scale video datasets can produce a great amount of various tracking behaviours. New trends in Reinforcement Learning showed that demonstrations of an expert agent can be efficiently used to speed-up the process of policy learning. Taking inspiration from such works and from the recent applications of Reinforcement Learning to visual tracking, we propose two novel trackers, A3CT, which exploits demonstrations of a state-of-the-art tracker to learn an effective tracking policy, and A3CTD, that takes advantage of the same expert tracker to correct its behaviour during tracking. Through an extensive experimental validation on the GOT-10k, OTB-100, LaSOT, UAV123 and VOT benchmarks, we show that the proposed trackers achieve state-of-the-art performance while running in real-time.",0
"Visual tracking using deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to solve one of the most challenging problems in computer vision, which is estimating the state of multiple objects over time while accounting for occlusions, motion blur, cluttered backgrounds, changing illumination conditions, camera movements, and scale variations. In contrast to classical visual tracking methods that rely on handcrafted features and model assumptions, the proposed method learns through trial-and-error interactions with real-world data to improve its performance. To ensure that the agent explores efficiently, we propose to combine deep reinforcement learning with guidance from an expert demonstration. This allows us to leverage prior knowledge in a principled manner, so that our tracker can learn better trajectories more quickly than without such guidance. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed tracker outperforms other published methods on several benchmark datasets.",1
"Optimization of hyper-parameters in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is a key task, because they determine how the agent will learn its policy by interacting with its environment, and thus what data is gathered. In this work, an approach that uses Bayesian optimization to perform a two-step optimization is proposed: first, categorical RL structure hyper-parameters are taken as binary variables and optimized with an acquisition function tailored for such variables. Then, at a lower level of abstraction, solution-level hyper-parameters are optimized by resorting to the expected improvement acquisition function, while using the best categorical hyper-parameters found in the optimization at the upper-level of abstraction. This two-tier approach is validated in a simulated control task. Results obtained are promising and open the way for more user-independent applications of reinforcement learning.",0
"A two-stage hyperparameter optimization approach for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been proposed. Our method first optimizes a set of low-level hyperparameters that directly affect the RL algorithm’s behavior using derivative-free local search techniques. Subsequently, we optimize high-level hyperparameters that control low-level hyperparameter settings and exploration parameters via bayesian optimization utilizing acquisition functions based on expected improvement and upper confidence bounds. Experimental results show significant improvements over random search across multiple benchmark domains.",1
"Recently, generating adversarial examples has become an important means of measuring robustness of a deep learning model. Adversarial examples help us identify the susceptibilities of the model and further counter those vulnerabilities by applying adversarial training techniques. In natural language domain, small perturbations in the form of misspellings or paraphrases can drastically change the semantics of the text. We propose a reinforcement learning based approach towards generating adversarial examples in black-box settings. We demonstrate that our method is able to fool well-trained models for (a) IMDB sentiment classification task and (b) AG's news corpus news categorization task with significantly high success rates. We find that the adversarial examples generated are semantics-preserving perturbations to the original text.",0

Our experiments show that DAE-BB consistently outperforms state-of-the art algorithms across multiple datasets and models, achieving high attack transferability rates while preserving semantic meaning. Additionally, we study and analyze the robustness properties of three different text classifier architectures under attack from our generated AEs, highlighting the vulnerabilities of these models to human-imperceptible input modifications. Overall, our work advances research into developing more reliable and secure NLP systems.",1

For tracking and prediction, approaches based on (deep) neural networks and other, especially stochastic techniques, are reported. For decision making, deep reinforcement learning algorithms are presented, together with methods used to explore different alternative actions, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search.",0
"In recent years, autonomous driving has become a rapidly developing field that promises to revolutionize transportation as we know it. With advancements in technology and algorithms, autonomous vehicles (AV) have quickly evolved from research prototypes to feasible solutions for real-world mobility challenges. Despite these developments, there remain many obstacles preventing AV deployment at scale. These hurdles stem mainly from limitations in perception systems, decision making processes, and the interaction between human drivers and automated systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of tracking, prediction, and decision making methods used in autonomous driving, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and potential applications. By analyzing current literature on these topics, we aim to provide insights into state-of-the-art techniques and identify future directions in AV development. Our focus is primarily on computational approaches, which offer great flexibility and scalability compared to hardware improvements alone. We discuss relevant aspects like sensor fusion, motion planning, scene understanding, risk assessment, and human machine interface design. The ultimate goal is to give readers a detailed picture of existing capabilities and research gaps that need attention going forward. Our findings indicate that while significant progress has been made towards safe and efficient AV operation, further innovations and testing are necessary before widespread adoption can occur safely. Nevertheless, the transformative impact of self-driving cars should continue inspiring new ideas and breakthroughs in this exciting domain.",1
"Reinforcement learning algorithms, though successful, tend to over-fit to training environments hampering their application to the real-world. This paper proposes $\text{W}\text{R}^{2}\text{L}$ -- a robust reinforcement learning algorithm with significant robust performance on low and high-dimensional control tasks. Our method formalises robust reinforcement learning as a novel min-max game with a Wasserstein constraint for a correct and convergent solver. Apart from the formulation, we also propose an efficient and scalable solver following a novel zero-order optimisation method that we believe can be useful to numerical optimisation in general. We empirically demonstrate significant gains compared to standard and robust state-of-the-art algorithms on high-dimensional MuJuCo environments.",0

"Modern reinforcement learning methods suffer from low sample efficiency and unsafe exploration, making it infeasible to train robotic policies entirely on real hardware. In this work, we propose to address the problem of sim-to-real domain transfer by using meta learning to train a policy that can adapt to a variety of dynamic conditions, and using a task-specific trajectory generation model to provide an action space that facilitates quick exploration. We evaluate the method by performing domain adaptation in simulation and analyzing the structure of the latent space during adaptation. We then deploy this policy on a KUKA LBR 4+ robot and evaluate its performance on a task of hitting a hockey puck to a target. Our method shows more consistent and stable domain adaptation than the baseline, resulting in better overall performance.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to domain adaptation using meta reinforcement learning. We propose that by leveraging prior experience from similar simulation-to-reality transfer tasks, we can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of adapting policies from simulated environments to real world settings. Our method uses a neural network meta learner to learn which parts of the policy to fine tune on the target task and how well these finetuned parameters generalize across multiple related simulation-to-real transfer problems. Experiments show our method achieves better performance than strong baselines while requiring significantly fewer real world interactions. Additionally, we provide an analysis showing that our learned meta knowledge indeed improves performance as expected. Overall, this work provides a scalable solution towards enabling agents trained only in simulations to perform competitively on complex real world domains.",1
"When estimating the relevancy between a query and a document, ranking models largely neglect the mutual information among documents. A common wisdom is that if two documents are similar in terms of the same query, they are more likely to have similar relevance score. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforced ranking model, named MarlRank. In particular, by considering each document as an agent, we formulate the ranking process as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the mutual interactions among documents are incorporated in the ranking process. To compute the ranking list, each document predicts its relevance to a query considering not only its own query-document features but also its similar documents features and actions. By defining reward as a function of NDCG, we can optimize our model directly on the ranking performance measure. Our experimental results on two LETOR benchmark datasets show that our model has significant performance gains over the state-of-art baselines. We also find that the NDCG shows an overall increasing trend along with the step of interactions, which demonstrates that the mutual information among documents helps improve the ranking performance.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning techniques to improve search engine rankings. One popular approach to achieving this goal is through the use of reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have shown promise in optimizing ranking systems by modeling interactions between agents and their environment. This paper proposes a novel MARL framework called MarlRank that addresses some key limitations in existing methods and improves upon them. Firstly, MarlRank leverages parallel computing capabilities to speed up training times by utilizing distributed environments. Secondly, it adopts a self-play strategy among multiple interacting agents which can lead to better convergence in fewer iterations compared to single agent models. Lastly, instead of relying on handcrafted features or pretrained embeddings as input to the model, MarlRank uses transformer architecture encoders fine tuned on downstream ranking task specific objectives to directly capture complex relationships between query, document, and relevance. Experiments conducted on large scale public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology in terms of accuracy metrics such as nDCG@10 and MRR. Our results show that MarlRank outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both warmstarted and from scratch settings.",1
"The estimation of advantage is crucial for a number of reinforcement learning algorithms, as it directly influences the choices of future paths. In this work, we propose a family of estimates based on the order statistics over the path ensemble, which allows one to flexibly drive the learning process, towards or against risks. On top of this formulation, we systematically study the impacts of different methods for estimating advantages. Our findings reveal that biased estimates, when chosen appropriately, can result in significant benefits. In particular, for the environments with sparse rewards, optimistic estimates would lead to more efficient exploration of the policy space; while for those where individual actions can have critical impacts, conservative estimates are preferable. On various benchmarks, including MuJoCo continuous control, Terrain locomotion, Atari games, and sparse-reward environments, the proposed biased estimation schemes consistently demonstrate improvement over mainstream methods, not only accelerating the learning process but also obtaining substantial performance gains.",0
"This is an unbiased summary: An ensemble based on all possible paths (the ""path ensemble"") provides an estimate of the average performance across many different runs of an algorithm. However, algorithms that use feedback from previous iterations (""online"" algorithms) can adapt their behavior differently depending on the path taken so far, potentially leading to better results than those seen in the path ensemble. For example, online bandit algorithms and some machine learning methods incorporate such feedback. In this work we explore how biases introduced by these algorithms lead to estimates of advantages over path ensembles being larger than they actually are. We find that as algorithms become more adaptive, the biases increase, resulting in further inflation of estimated advantage over path ensembles. We provide guidelines for quantifying both bias and variance of path dependent estimators using concentration bounds under specific conditions. These allow us to characterize conditions under which estimates obtained from one method may outperform another, improving our understanding of the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Our analysis leads to new insight into online decision making that is useful for designing effective algorithms with provably good performance guarantees.",1

To guide experimentation, Wield further introduces a novel task design protocol and classification scheme centred around staged randomization to incrementally evaluate model capabilities.",0
"Title: ""Systematic Reinforcement Learning with Progressive Randomization""  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in solving complex decision making problems across diverse fields such as robotics, gaming, finance and healthcare among others. However, many real world RL applications require large amounts of computational resources which makes deploying them on edge devices impossible in most cases. In addition, finding appropriate hyperparameters, which can take days, leads to slower iteration cycles further hindering deployment. We propose a new algorithm that leverages progressively increasing randomness during training coupled with systematically varying model architecture parameters to enable fast and efficient training while significantly reducing the dependency on hyperparameter tuning. Our approach is simple yet effective in achieving performance comparable to state of art models on several benchmark tasks across distinct environments. Furthermore, we provide insights into how our method works by analyzing the learned agents behavior and associated neural representations. Overall, these results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed method towards solving a broad range of RL problems using limited compute resources while enabling faster exploration of the solution space through more informed iterative design choices.",1
This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning architecture that was inspired by previous tree structured architectures which were only useable in discrete action spaces. Policy Prediction Network offers a way to improve sample complexity and performance on continuous control problems in exchange for extra computation at training time but at no cost in computation at rollout time. Our approach integrates a mix between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning. Policy Prediction Network is the first to introduce implicit model-based learning to Policy Gradient algorithms for continuous action space and is made possible via the empirically justified clipping scheme. Our experiments are focused on the MuJoCo environments so that they can be compared with similar work done in this area.,0
"This paper presents a novel method for model-free behavior policy optimization that combines model-based learning with model-free actor-critic methods in continuous action spaces. Our approach, which we call the Policy Prediction Network (PPN), leverages recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) while addressing several limitations of existing approaches. Unlike traditional model-free methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and SAC, PPN learns both a value function and a transition model simultaneously without relying on any prior knowledge of the environment dynamics. Furthermore, our method overcomes some of the limitations associated with model-based algorithms like TD-learning by using modern neural network architectures and focusing only on the most relevant parts of the state space during training. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on benchmark control tasks and Atari games that our approach achieves strong performance compared to competitive baselines across different settings.",1
"The goal of imitation learning (IL) is to learn a good policy from high-quality demonstrations. However, the quality of demonstrations in reality can be diverse, since it is easier and cheaper to collect demonstrations from a mix of experts and amateurs. IL in such situations can be challenging, especially when the level of demonstrators' expertise is unknown. We propose a new IL method called \underline{v}ariational \underline{i}mitation \underline{l}earning with \underline{d}iverse-quality demonstrations (VILD), where we explicitly model the level of demonstrators' expertise with a probabilistic graphical model and estimate it along with a reward function. We show that a naive approach to estimation is not suitable to large state and action spaces, and fix its issues by using a variational approach which can be easily implemented using existing reinforcement learning methods. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that VILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work enables scalable and data-efficient IL under more realistic settings than before.",0
"Title: ""Learning from Human Demonstration: Efficiently Using High-Quality Examples""  Abstract: This paper addresses one of the key challenges in robotics and computer vision, namely learning from human demonstration (HDA). Traditional approaches focus on using low-variability, high-quality examples, often provided by experts. However, these methods suffer from two major issues: first, they require significant amounts of time and resources to collect large datasets; second, their performance degrades significantly when confronted with noisy or suboptimal demonstrations. We propose an alternative approach that leverages variational imitation learning (VIL) to efficiently learn from diverse quality demonstrations. Our method exploits the diversity of demonstrations to estimate the uncertainty associated with each trajectory and selectively weights them according to their quality. By doing so, our algorithm can effectively handle situations where only a few examples are available or when some trajectories may contain errors. Moreover, we show how to use VIL to identify which parts of the demonstrated behaviors might have been performed suboptimally or erroneously. Empirical evaluation across multiple robotic manipulation tasks shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art HDA techniques while requiring fewer demonstrations. Overall, our work makes important progress towards enabling robots to seamlessly interact with humans in dynamic environments and learn from natural guidance.

"In class-incremental learning, a model learns continuously from a sequential data stream in which new classes occur. Existing methods often rely on static architectures that are manually crafted. These methods can be prone to capacity saturation because a neural network's ability to generalize to new concepts is limited by its fixed capacity. To understand how to expand a continual learner, we focus on the neural architecture design problem in the context of class-incremental learning: at each time step, the learner must optimize its performance on all classes observed so far by selecting the most competitive neural architecture. To tackle this problem, we propose Continual Neural Architecture Search (CNAS): an autoML approach that takes advantage of the sequential nature of class-incremental learning to efficiently and adaptively identify strong architectures in a continual learning setting. We employ a task network to perform the classification task and a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller for architecture search. In addition, we apply network transformations to transfer weights from previous learning step and to reduce the size of the architecture search space, thus saving a large amount of computational resources. We evaluate CNAS on the CIFAR-100 dataset under varied incremental learning scenarios with limited computational power (1 GPU). Experimental results demonstrate that CNAS outperforms architectures that are optimized for the entire dataset. In addition, CNAS is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than naively using existing autoML methods.",0
"Incremental learning has been a fundamental goal of artificial intelligence (AI) research since its earliest days. By enabling machines to learn from new data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, incremental learning holds great promise for applications such as life-long learning robots, personalized assistants, and adaptive decision making systems.

This paper presents a neural architecture search approach that systematically explores different architectures to find the optimal model for incremental learning. Our method involves searching over alternative network structures, regularization terms, hyperparameters and initialization schemes, all while ensuring zero forgetting on previous tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to strong baselines across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we provide detailed analysis of the selected architectures and their characteristics, which sheds light into how neural networks learn and generalize under incremental settings. Overall, our work advances the state-of-the-art in class-incremental learning and paves the way towards more robust and versatile AI models.",1
"Open domain dialog systems face the challenge of being repetitive and producing generic responses. In this paper, we demonstrate that by conditioning the response generation on interpretable discrete dialog attributes and composed attributes, it helps improve the model perplexity and results in diverse and interesting non-redundant responses. We propose to formulate the dialog attribute prediction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and use policy gradients methods to optimize utterance generation using long-term rewards. Unlike existing RL approaches which formulate the token prediction as a policy, our method reduces the complexity of the policy optimization by limiting the action space to dialog attributes, thereby making the policy optimization more practical and sample efficient. We demonstrate this with experimental and human evaluations.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great promise as a methodology to train agents capable of performing complex tasks such as language generation and game playing. However, training DRL systems on large datasets can require enormous computational resources, making it difficult for researchers without access to high-performance hardware to investigate new models and techniques. This paper describes an approach that overcomes these limitations by scaling down both the state space and action space while retaining key aspects of human conversational behavior using continuous representations and discrete attributes. By modeling chitchat dialogs as Markov decision processes (MDP), we can use policy gradient methods to learn policies directly from human demonstrations collected via crowdsourcing platforms. Our experiments show that our model significantly outperforms baselines in terms of perplexity, and generates more diverse responses while preserving coherency across multiple turns of conversation. We hope this work opens up opportunities for further investigation into the applications of DRL to natural language processing problems beyond chatbot dialogue. ----  In summary, this article proposes a scalable approach for applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to training chatbots with discrete attributes, addressing previous resource constraints and facilitating broader exploration of RL methods for NLP challenges. Experiments indicate significant improvements against benchmarks on metrics including perplexity and response diversity while maintaining coherence. Future development of DRL in NLP may benefit from this promising technique.",1
"Real-world graph applications, such as advertisements and product recommendations make profits based on accurately classify the label of the nodes. However, in such scenarios, there are high incentives for the adversaries to attack such graph to reduce the node classification performance. Previous work on graph adversarial attacks focus on modifying existing graph structures, which is infeasible in most real-world applications. In contrast, it is more practical to inject adversarial nodes into existing graphs, which can also potentially reduce the performance of the classifier. In this paper, we study the novel node injection poisoning attacks problem which aims to poison the graph. We describe a reinforcement learning based method, namely NIPA, to sequentially modify the adversarial information of the injected nodes. We report the results of experiments using several benchmark data sets that show the superior performance of the proposed method NIPA, relative to the existing state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Traditional control methods are inadequate in many deployment settings involving control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In such settings, CPS controllers must operate and respond to unpredictable interactions, conditions, or failure modes. Dealing with such unpredictability requires the use of executive and cognitive control functions that allow for planning and reasoning. Motivated by the sport of drone racing, this dissertation addresses these concerns for state-of-the-art flight control by investigating the use of deep neural networks to bring essential elements of higher-level cognition for constructing low level flight controllers.   This thesis reports on the development and release of an open source, full solution stack for building neuro-flight controllers. This stack consists of the methodology for constructing a multicopter digital twin for synthesize the flight controller unique to a specific aircraft, a tuning framework for implementing training environments (GymFC), and a firmware for the world's first neural network supported flight controller (Neuroflight). GymFC's novel approach fuses together the digital twinning paradigm for flight control training to provide seamless transfer to hardware. Additionally, this thesis examines alternative reward system functions as well as changes to the software environment to bridge the gap between the simulation and real world deployment environments.

"This sounds like an interesting topic! Here is an example of how you could write an abstract: The goal of flight controller synthesis is to design controllers that can effectively control aircraft under different operating conditions while satisfying safety requirements and performance criteria. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach to solve complex control problems in many domains, including robotics, computer vision, and game playing. However, applying DRL to real-world applications such as flight control remains challenging due to several factors, such as the large state space, high uncertainty, and nonlinear dynamics. This paper presents a methodology for flight controller synthesis via DRL. We propose using a novel variant of Q-learning called experience replay priority Q-learning that enables faster convergence and better stability during training. Our approach also includes techniques to address issues related to exploration and exploitation in unknown environments where prior knowledge may be limited or incomplete. We evaluate our proposed method on a benchmark problem, where we aim to control an aircraft to land safely and accurately at the runway given varying wind directions and velocities. Experimental results demonstrate that our DRL-based approach outperforms traditional linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based methods by achieving better landing accuracy and lower touchdown error rates.

"In this work, we address the problem of tuning communication libraries by using a deep reinforcement learning approach. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique incredibly effective in solving game-like situations. In fact, tuning a set of parameters in a communication library in order to get better performance in a parallel application can be expressed as a game: Find the right combination/path that provides the best reward. Even though AITuning has been designed to be utilized with different run-time libraries, we focused this work on applying it to the OpenCoarrays run-time communication library, built on top of MPI-3. This work not only shows the potential of using a reinforcement learning algorithm for tuning communication libraries, but also demonstrates how the MPI Tool Information Interface, introduced by the MPI-3 standard, can be used effectively by run-time libraries to improve the performance without human intervention.",0

"More and more companies have deployed machine learning (ML) clusters, where deep learning (DL) models are trained for providing various AI-driven services. Efficient resource scheduling is essential for maximal utilization of expensive DL clusters. Existing cluster schedulers either are agnostic to ML workload characteristics, or use scheduling heuristics based on operators' understanding of particular ML framework and workload, which are less efficient or not general enough. In this paper, we show that DL techniques can be adopted to design a generic and efficient scheduler. DL2 is a DL-driven scheduler for DL clusters, targeting global training job expedition by dynamically resizing resources allocated to jobs. DL2 advocates a joint supervised learning and reinforcement learning approach: a neural network is warmed up via offline supervised learning based on job traces produced by the existing cluster scheduler; then the neural network is plugged into the live DL cluster, fine-tuned by reinforcement learning carried out throughout the training progress of the DL jobs, and used for deciding job resource allocation in an online fashion. By applying past decisions made by the existing cluster scheduler in the preparatory supervised learning phase, our approach enables a smooth transition from existing scheduler, and renders a high-quality scheduler in minimizing average training completion time. We implement DL2 on Kubernetes and enable dynamic resource scaling in DL jobs on MXNet. Extensive evaluation shows that DL2 outperforms fairness scheduler (i.e., DRF) by 44.1% and expert heuristic scheduler (i.e., Optimus) by 17.5% in terms of average job completion time.",0
"This paper presents a deep learning driven scheduler for managing resources in clusters used for training artificial neural networks (ANNs) which use backpropagation. While existing schedulers based on gradient descent and asynchronous updates were effective at reducing model training time by up to two times, they suffered from high latency variability due to network congestion caused by large amounts of data transmission across nodes. To address these issues, we introduce DL2, a new type of algorithmic scheduler that takes into account both gradient and model state during distributed deep learning optimization. By doing so, our approach achieves significant reduction in network congestion as well as improving convergence speed. We evaluate our system using multiple benchmarks, showing an average improvement in throughput of over three times compared to current methods while meeting strict accuracy requirements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging deep learning techniques to improve cluster performance during distributed machine learning tasks.

"In this paper we consider the basic version of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that involves computing optimal data driven (adaptive) policies for Markovian decision process with unknown transition probabilities. We provide a brief survey of the state of the art of the area and we compare the performance of the classic UCB policy of \cc{bkmdp97} with a new policy developed herein which we call MDP-Deterministic Minimum Empirical Divergence (MDP-DMED), and a method based on Posterior sampling (MDP-PS).",0
"This paper compares two adaptive policies using upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm against alternative algorithms for optimizing multi armed bandits problem under stochastic setting. By comparing the cumulative regret and time complexity, we demonstrate that UCB indeed has some advantages on both dimensions over other approaches like Boltzmann exploration bonus and epsilon greedy policy. Furthermore, our empirical results show that even though UCB enjoys nice theoretical guarantees, those guarantees may have limited impacts in real implementations since they typically require specific conditions. For example, Bernoulli rewards would result in very good bounds but real world applications often encounter different kinds of noises which bring additional difficulties in getting accurate estimations. All these findings provide useful insights into better understanding adaptive learning methods when facing complex and uncertain problems as well as their limitations. In conclusion, while there still remain open questions regarding how to extend these results to more general cases including non stationary environments and partial monitoring settings, our work represents one step forward towards addressing such issues with rigorous experimentation validation.",1
"Social sensing has emerged as a new sensing paradigm where humans (or devices on their behalf) collectively report measurements about the physical world. This paper focuses on a quality-cost-aware task allocation problem in multi-attribute social sensing applications. The goal is to identify a task allocation strategy (i.e., decide when and where to collect sensing data) to achieve an optimized tradeoff between the data quality and the sensing cost. While recent progress has been made to tackle similar problems, three important challenges have not been well addressed: (i) ""online task allocation"": the task allocation schemes need to respond quickly to the potentially large dynamics of the measured variables in social sensing; (ii) ""multi-attribute constrained optimization"": minimizing the overall sensing error given the dependencies and constraints of multiple attributes of the measured variables is a non-trivial problem to solve; (iii) ""nonuniform task allocation cost"": the task allocation cost in social sensing often has a nonuniform distribution which adds additional complexity to the optimized task allocation problem. This paper develops a Quality-Cost-Aware Online Task Allocation (QCO-TA) scheme to address the above challenges using a principled online reinforcement learning framework. We evaluate the QCO-TA scheme through a real-world social sensing application and the results show that our scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both sensing accuracy and cost.",0
"This research focuses on developing a quality-cost-aware task allocation algorithm that can effectively assign social sensors in multi-attribute environments using online reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed approach considers multiple attributes such as cost, energy consumption, communication distance, and environmental impact while maximizing the overall system performance.  The developed RL model uses a continuous state space representation of the environment including both physical properties of tasks and sensors' parameters. Based on the observation of each sensor node's state, a Q-table based decision-making process adjusts the assignment policy according to its local environment to optimize the performance metric. In addition, the learning rate parameter controls how quickly the agent adapts to new situations.  Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. With high speed efficiency, better performance accuracy, lower resource overheads, improved response time, and reduced communication delay under diverse network conditions, our approach shows significant advantages over other methods that rely mainly on centralized control, heuristics-based algorithms, and game theory models.  In summary, this work introduces a novel online RL approach to quality-cost-aware task allocation problem for multi-attribute social sensing systems. By incorporating real-time adaptation and distributed intelligence into the sensing mechanism, it enables efficient deployment of resources and promotes effective data collection in large-scale IoT applications.",1
"Cumulative entropy regularization introduces a regulatory signal to the reinforcement learning (RL) problem that encourages policies with high-entropy actions, which is equivalent to enforcing small deviations from a uniform reference marginal policy. This has been shown to improve exploration and robustness, and it tackles the value overestimation problem. It also leads to a significant performance increase in tabular and high-dimensional settings, as demonstrated via algorithms such as soft Q-learning (SQL) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Cumulative entropy regularization has been extended to optimize over the reference marginal policy instead of keeping it fixed, yielding a regularization that minimizes the mutual information between states and actions. While this has been initially proposed for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in tabular settings, it was recently shown that a similar principle leads to significant improvements over vanilla SQL in RL for high-dimensional domains with discrete actions and function approximators.   Here, we follow the motivation of mutual-information regularization from an inference perspective and theoretically analyze the corresponding Bellman operator. Inspired by this Bellman operator, we devise a novel mutual-information regularized actor-critic learning (MIRACLE) algorithm for continuous action spaces that optimizes over the reference marginal policy. We empirically validate MIRACLE in the Mujoco robotics simulator, where we demonstrate that it can compete with contemporary RL methods. Most notably, it can improve over the model-free state-of-the-art SAC algorithm which implicitly assumes a fixed reference policy.",0
"Incorporating mutual information into the regularization framework has proven effective in improving model stability by reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance. This study examines how incorporating mutual information can enhance actor-critic learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) through regularizing both the policy and value function updates. By doing so, we aim to improve the overall efficiency and stability of actor-critic algorithms. Our experiments show that adding mutual information regularization leads to improved performance across different MDP domains compared to state-of-the-art methods without suffering from instability issues commonly encountered in these methods. We provide theoretical analysis of why our method works better than traditional regularizations used in deep reinforcement learning. Overall, mutual information regularization provides a more robust alternative to existing approaches that seeks optimization objectives beyond minimizing prediction errors alone.",1
"Structured weight pruning is a representative model compression technique of DNNs to reduce the storage and computation requirements and accelerate inference. An automatic hyperparameter determination process is necessary due to the large number of flexible hyperparameters. This work proposes AutoCompress, an automatic structured pruning framework with the following key performance improvements: (i) effectively incorporate the combination of structured pruning schemes in the automatic process; (ii) adopt the state-of-art ADMM-based structured weight pruning as the core algorithm, and propose an innovative additional purification step for further weight reduction without accuracy loss; and (iii) develop effective heuristic search method enhanced by experience-based guided search, replacing the prior deep reinforcement learning technique which has underlying incompatibility with the target pruning problem. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that AutoCompress is the key to achieve ultra-high pruning rates on the number of weights and FLOPs that cannot be achieved before. As an example, AutoCompress outperforms the prior work on automatic model compression by up to 33x in pruning rate (120x reduction in the actual parameter count) under the same accuracy. Significant inference speedup has been observed from the AutoCompress framework on actual measurements on smartphone. We release all models of this work at anonymous link: http://bit.ly/2VZ63dS.",0
Artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements over recent years thanks largely to large neural networks known as Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However these models require substantial computational resources during both training and inference phases making them difficult to deploy on resource constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems. To address these limitations we propose a novel structured pruning framework named AutoCompress that automatically prunes unimportant neurons from DNN architectures. Our framework provides significantly higher compression rates compared to prior work while still retaining high accuracy levels on popular benchmark datasets. We provide analysis of our method through experiments with ResNet56 and VGG19 architectures demonstrating how compression rates of up to 42x can be achieved without loss of prediction performance. Additionally our proposed algorithm significantly reduces latency by orders of magnitude in comparison to other existing methods. By achieving ultra-high compression ratios AutoCompress enables deployment of deep learning models onto low powered hardware improving accessibility and reducing reliance on cloud computing.,1
"As reinforcement learning (RL) achieves more success in solving complex tasks, more care is needed to ensure that RL research is reproducible and that algorithms herein can be compared easily and fairly with minimal bias. RL results are, however, notoriously hard to reproduce due to the algorithms' intrinsic variance, the environments' stochasticity, and numerous (potentially unreported) hyper-parameters. In this work we investigate the many issues leading to irreproducible research and how to manage those. We further show how to utilise a rigorous and standardised evaluation approach for easing the process of documentation, evaluation and fair comparison of different algorithms, where we emphasise the importance of choosing the right measurement metrics and conducting proper statistics on the results, for unbiased reporting of the results.",0
"This study presents a survey on reproducibility in deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms applied to real-world robots.

"Proximal policy optimization and trust region policy optimization (PPO and TRPO) with actor and critic parametrized by neural networks achieve significant empirical success in deep reinforcement learning. However, due to nonconvexity, the global convergence of PPO and TRPO remains less understood, which separates theory from practice. In this paper, we prove that a variant of PPO and TRPO equipped with overparametrized neural networks converges to the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. The key to our analysis is the global convergence of infinite-dimensional mirror descent under a notion of one-point monotonicity, where the gradient and iterate are instantiated by neural networks. In particular, the desirable representation power and optimization geometry induced by the overparametrization of such neural networks allow them to accurately approximate the infinite-dimensional gradient and iterate.",0
"This study presents an algorithm for finding globally optimal policies using neural proximal trust region policy optimization (NPTRO). The NPTRO method combines elements from both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, and uses a quadratic approximation of the value function at each iteration. By utilizing a neural network to evaluate the cost function, the method can handle complex nonlinear problems that traditional methods may struggle with. The results show that NPTRO outperforms other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms on several challenging benchmark tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness at solving sequential decision making problems. The use of globally optimal solutions has implications across many domains, including robotics, finance, and healthcare.",1
"Bandit algorithms have been predominantly analyzed in the convex setting with function-value based stationary regret as the performance measure. In this paper, motivated by online reinforcement learning problems, we propose and analyze bandit algorithms for both general and structured nonconvex problems with nonstationary (or dynamic) regret as the performance measure, in both stochastic and non-stochastic settings. First, for general nonconvex functions, we consider nonstationary versions of first-order and second-order stationary solutions as a regret measure, motivated by similar performance measures for offline nonconvex optimization. In the case of second-order stationary solution based regret, we propose and analyze online and bandit versions of the cubic regularized Newton's method. The bandit version is based on estimating the Hessian matrices in the bandit setting, based on second-order Gaussian Stein's identity. Our nonstationary regret bounds in terms of second-order stationary solutions have interesting consequences for avoiding saddle points in the bandit setting. Next, for weakly quasi convex functions and monotone weakly submodular functions we consider nonstationary regret measures in terms of function-values; such structured classes of nonconvex functions enable one to consider regret measure defined in terms of function values, similar to convex functions. For this case of function-value, and first-order stationary solution based regret measures, we provide regret bounds in both the low- and high-dimensional settings, for some scenarios.",0
"In this paper, we study multi-point bandits algorithms for online nonconvex optimization under nonstationary settings. These problems arise naturally in many applications such as recommendation systems, traffic routing, portfolio management, and active learning. We propose three novel bandit algorithms that leverage recent advances in regret analysis of convex and nonconvex finite-sum stochastic gradient descent. Our first algorithm (MPB-NonConvX) uses variance reduction techniques from Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to achieve sublinear regret bounds against any fixed comparator. Our second algorithm (MPB-NCMA) adapts mirror prophets with respect to a changing benchmark to account for varying regret minimizers. Lastly, our third algorithm (MPB-NCCSA) combines both MPB-NonConvX and MPB-NCMA using an ensemble approach and achieves tighter upper bounds on regret than either individual method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these new methods over state-of-the-art baselines across several synthetic datasets and real-world application domains.",1
Reinforcement learning has exceeded human-level performance in game playing AI with deep learning methods according to the experiments from DeepMind on Go and Atari games. Deep learning solves high dimension input problems which stop the development of reinforcement for many years. This study uses both two techniques to create several agents with different algorithms that successfully learn to play T-rex Runner. Deep Q network algorithm and three types of improvements are implemented to train the agent. The results from some of them are far from satisfactory but others are better than human experts. Batch normalization is a method to solve internal covariate shift problems in deep neural network. The positive influence of this on reinforcement learning has also been proved in this study.,0
"One popular approach for training artificial intelligence (AI) agents is through reinforcement learning (RL). RL algorithms use trial-and-error interactions between an agent and its environment to learn a policy that maximizes some measure of success. In recent years, there has been growing interest in applying RL to video games due to their complex environments, well-defined reward signals, and potential as testbeds for general intelligence. This paper surveys the field of RL applied to video game domains, including: single-agent settings like ATARI games; multi-agent competitive and cooperative tasks; text-based adventure games and puzzle solving; real-time strategy games and sports simulations; and continuous control problems requiring pixel-level actions. We discuss state representation, exploration strategies, value function estimation, deep RL methods, imitation learning, transfer, and curriculum design issues specific to these settings. We highlight notable achievements, limitations, open challenges, and future directions. While progress has been rapid, significant challenges remain in scaling these techniques beyond existing benchmark domains and achieving human-like performance on more complex problems. Overall, we aim to provide readers with a broad overview of current work in using RL to train intelligent agents in simulated worlds inspired by video games.",1
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used widely to generate large volumes of synthetic data. This data is being utilized for augmenting with real examples in order to train deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Studies have shown that the generated examples lack sufficient realism to train deep CNNs and are poor in diversity. Unlike previous studies of randomly augmenting the synthetic data with real data, we present our simple, effective and easy to implement synthetic data sampling methods to train deep CNNs more efficiently and accurately. To this end, we propose to maximally utilize the parameters learned during training of the GAN itself. These include discriminator's realism confidence score and the confidence on the target label of the synthetic data. In addition to this, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically search a subset of meaningful synthetic examples from a large pool of GAN synthetic data. We evaluate our method on two challenging face attribute classification data sets viz. AffectNet and CelebA. Our extensive experiments clearly demonstrate the need of sampling synthetic data before augmentation, which also improves the performance of one of the state-of-the-art deep CNNs in vitro.",0
"A major challenge in using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing data involves selecting appropriate sampling strategies that minimize bias while maximizing computational efficiency.

We validate our methods through extensive experiments across multiple domains including image generation tasks. Results show significant reductions in variance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high quality synthetic samples. Our work provides valuable insights for practitioners and researchers aiming to create reliable and efficient GAN systems for generating diverse datasets.",1
"We propose RUDDER, a novel reinforcement learning approach for delayed rewards in finite Markov decision processes (MDPs). In MDPs the Q-values are equal to the expected immediate reward plus the expected future rewards. The latter are related to bias problems in temporal difference (TD) learning and to high variance problems in Monte Carlo (MC) learning. Both problems are even more severe when rewards are delayed. RUDDER aims at making the expected future rewards zero, which simplifies Q-value estimation to computing the mean of the immediate reward. We propose the following two new concepts to push the expected future rewards toward zero. (i) Reward redistribution that leads to return-equivalent decision processes with the same optimal policies and, when optimal, zero expected future rewards. (ii) Return decomposition via contribution analysis which transforms the reinforcement learning task into a regression task at which deep learning excels. On artificial tasks with delayed rewards, RUDDER is significantly faster than MC and exponentially faster than Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), TD({\lambda}), and reward shaping approaches. At Atari games, RUDDER on top of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline improves the scores, which is most prominent at games with delayed rewards. Source code is available at \url{https://github.com/ml-jku/rudder} and demonstration videos at \url{https://goo.gl/EQerZV}.",0

The upper bound on the regret is given in terms of the total variation in the MDP. This is the first variational regret bound for the general reinforcement learning setting.",0
"This paper presents novel theoretical results on regret bounds for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that use variational methods. We develop new regret guarantees for two popular families of RL algorithms: Q-learning and policy gradient methods. Our analysis leverages recent advances in variational inference, enabling us to derive tighter regret bounds compared to existing work.  For Q-learning, we introduce a new algorithm called Quasi-Regularized Q-Learning (QRQL), which combines regularization techniques from supervised learning with iterative quarter-square root updates inspired by neural networks. We establish regret guarantees under weak assumptions on problem complexity and demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of benchmark problems.  In addition, we study policy gradient methods based on natural actor-critic frameworks, where both the actor and critic are learned using variational approximations. We prove near-optimal regret bounds for these models under standard smoothness and ergodicity conditions, providing further evidence that variational methods can achieve strong performance in RL.  Our contributions highlight the utility of variational inference in designing efficient and effective RL algorithms, with potentially broader implications beyond traditional RL domains such as robotics and computer vision. Overall, this research demonstrates the power of incorporating insights from machine learning into RL to improve performance and drive future progress in artificial intelligence.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNN) has been successfully applied to operate on the graph-structured data. Given a specific scenario, rich human expertise and tremendous laborious trials are usually required to identify a suitable GNN architecture. It is because the performance of a GNN architecture is significantly affected by the choice of graph convolution components, such as aggregate function and hidden dimension. Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown its potential in discovering effective deep architectures for learning tasks in image and language modeling. However, existing NAS algorithms cannot be directly applied to the GNN search problem. First, the search space of GNN is different from the ones in existing NAS work. Second, the representation learning capacity of GNN architecture changes obviously with slight architecture modifications. It affects the search efficiency of traditional search methods. Third, widely used techniques in NAS such as parameter sharing might become unstable in GNN.   To bridge the gap, we propose the automated graph neural networks (AGNN) framework, which aims to find an optimal GNN architecture within a predefined search space. A reinforcement learning based controller is designed to greedily validate architectures via small steps. AGNN has a novel parameter sharing strategy that enables homogeneous architectures to share parameters, based on a carefully-designed homogeneity definition. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GNN architecture identified by AGNN achieves the best performance, comparing with existing handcrafted models and tradistional search methods.",0

"In this paper we propose a deep neural network model with an encoder-decoder architecture that translates images of math formulas into their LaTeX markup sequences. The encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that transforms images into a group of feature maps. To better capture the spatial relationships of math symbols, the feature maps are augmented with 2D positional encoding before being unfolded into a vector. The decoder is a stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model integrated with the soft attention mechanism, which works as a language model to translate the encoder output into a sequence of LaTeX tokens. The neural network is trained in two steps. The first step is token-level training using the Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE) as the objective function. At completion of the token-level training, the sequence-level training objective function is employed to optimize the overall model based on the policy gradient algorithm from reinforcement learning. Our design also overcomes the exposure bias problem by closing the feedback loop in the decoder during sequence-level training, i.e., feeding in the predicted token instead of the ground truth token at every time step. The model is trained and evaluated on the IM2LATEX-100K dataset and shows state-of-the-art performance on both sequence-based and image-based evaluation metrics.",0

"The use of semantic segmentation for masking and cropping input images has proven to be a significant aid in medical imaging classification tasks by decreasing the noise and variance of the training dataset. However, implementing this approach with classical methods is challenging: the cost of obtaining a dense segmentation is high, and the precise input area that is most crucial to the classification task is difficult to determine a-priori. We propose a novel joint-training deep reinforcement learning framework for image augmentation. A segmentation network, weakly supervised with policy gradient optimization, acts as an agent, and outputs masks as actions given samples as states, with the goal of maximizing reward signals from the classification network. In this way, the segmentation network learns to mask unimportant imaging features. Our method, Adversarial Policy Gradient Augmentation (APGA), shows promising results on Stanford's MURA dataset and on a hip fracture classification task with an increase in global accuracy of up to 7.33% and improved performance over baseline methods in 9/10 tasks evaluated. We discuss the broad applicability of our joint training strategy to a variety of medical imaging tasks.",0
"Automatic image data augmentation techniques have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to increase the amount of training data available, without requiring manual labeling. These methods can significantly improve deep learning models by introducing variations of existing images that are often used during model training. However, these methods may still suffer from certain limitations such as lack of diversity, limited capacity for generating realistic images, and difficulty adapting to specific tasks. To overcome some of these issues, we propose Adversarial Policy Gradient (APG), which combines reinforcement learning techniques with adversarial training. Our method utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate diverse sets of synthetic samples conditioned on real images. We then use a policy gradient approach to optimize the parameters of the generator network and maximize the expected reward signal over a sequence of generated samples. Additionally, APG incorporates task-specific regularization terms into the optimization process to encourage the generation of high quality samples relevant to the target task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmark datasets and architectures.",1
"Variational inference with {\alpha}-divergences has been widely used in modern probabilistic machine learning. Compared to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a major advantage of using {\alpha}-divergences (with positive {\alpha} values) is their mass-covering property. However, estimating and optimizing {\alpha}-divergences require to use importance sampling, which could have extremely large or infinite variances due to heavy tails of importance weights. In this paper, we propose a new class of tail-adaptive f-divergences that adaptively change the convex function f with the tail of the importance weights, in a way that theoretically guarantees finite moments, while simultaneously achieving mass-covering properties. We test our methods on Bayesian neural networks, as well as deep reinforcement learning in which our method is applied to improve a recent soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Our results show that our approach yields significant advantages compared with existing methods based on classical KL and {\alpha}-divergences.",0
"This should summarize the important points made by the authors in their paper: The main contributions of our paper can be summarized as follows:   * We present a method for variational inference using a family of f-divergences that adapts based on the tail behavior of the distributions involved. This leads to improved accuracy over traditional methods that use fixed divergences such as KL divergence or Jensen-Shannon divergence. * Our approach allows for flexible control of the balance between data fit and model complexity, providing more accurate estimates and improving robustness to changes in dataset size and noise level. * Using synthetic datasets and real world applications, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance across different domains compared to state-of-the art methods. * We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed method under regularity conditions and discuss connections to existing frameworks. Additionally, we showcase how our framework can be applied in conjunction with other techniques such as importance sampling to further improve results.

"We consider the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of selecting a subset of items at each step, termed the Select-MDP (S-MDP). The large state and action spaces of S-MDPs make them intractable to solve with typical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms especially when the number of items is huge. In this paper, we present a deep RL algorithm to solve this issue by adopting the following key ideas. First, we convert the original S-MDP into an Iterative Select-MDP (IS-MDP), which is equivalent to the S-MDP in terms of optimal actions. IS-MDP decomposes a joint action of selecting K items simultaneously into K iterative selections resulting in the decrease of actions at the expense of an exponential increase of states. Second, we overcome this state space explo-sion by exploiting a special symmetry in IS-MDPs with novel weight shared Q-networks, which prov-ably maintain sufficient expressive power. Various experiments demonstrate that our approach works well even when the item space is large and that it scales to environments with item spaces different from those used in training.",0
"Title: ""Solving Continual Combinatorial Selection via Deep Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: In many real-world decision making scenarios such as routing optimization, inventory management, and product configuration design, combinatorial selection problems arise where an agent needs to choose from multiple alternatives, subject to constraints and objective functions that depend on contextual factors varying over time. Traditional approaches often suffer from slow convergence rates and high computational overheads due to modeling complexities such as variable cardinality and ordinal preferences. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promising results in addressing these challenges through reinforcement learning (RL) techniques tailored to continuous action spaces; yet handling discrete combinatorial actions remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we present a novel framework leveraging deep RL principles under continual constraint satisfaction conditions to learn efficient policies directly mapping evolving problem instances onto near-optimal solution configurations for combinatorial selection problems. We establish theoretical foundations grounded upon policy improvement guarantees under general nonlinear reward functions and soft constraints, providing insight into how our algorithm adaptively balances exploration against exploitation along temporal horizons driven by task variability. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains over competitive baseline methods across diverse domains spanning both synthetic benchmarks inspired by real applications and industrial use cases stemming from an established provider of global supply chain solutions. Overall, our work offers a flexible and scalable approach applicable to solve hard continual combinatorial selections with dynamic environments and uncertain objectives—the first attempt of its kind within the RL community—positioned to fuel future progress toward mastering sequential multi-decision making processes involving rich, structured state representations subject to complex constraints.

"Modeling and prediction of human motion dynamics has long been a challenging problem in computer vision, and most existing methods rely on the end-to-end supervised training of various architectures of recurrent neural networks. Inspired by the recent success of deep reinforcement learning methods, in this paper we propose a new reinforcement learning formulation for the problem of human pose prediction, and develop an imitation learning algorithm for predicting future poses under this formulation through a combination of behavioral cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning. Our experiments show that our proposed method outperforms all existing state-of-the-art baseline models by large margins on the task of human pose prediction in both short-term predictions and long-term predictions, while also enjoying huge advantage in training speed.",0

"Value function estimation is an important task in reinforcement learning, i.e., prediction. The Boltzmann softmax operator is a natural value estimator and can provide several benefits. However, it does not satisfy the non-expansion property, and its direct use may fail to converge even in value iteration. In this paper, we propose to update the value function with dynamic Boltzmann softmax (DBS) operator, which has good convergence property in the setting of planning and learning. Experimental results on GridWorld show that the DBS operator enables better estimation of the value function, which rectifies the convergence issue of the softmax operator. Finally, we propose the DBS-DQN algorithm by applying dynamic Boltzmann softmax updates in deep Q-network, which outperforms DQN substantially in 40 out of 49 Atari games.",0
"This paper presents a new methodology for reinforcement learning (RL) that combines dynamic boltzmann softmax updates with traditional RL algorithms. The authors argue that existing methods of updating boltzmann distributions in RL systems can result in suboptimal solutions due to limitations on how quickly the model can adapt to changing environments. To address these challenges, they propose using dynamic boltzmann softmax updates instead, which allow the agent to more effectively explore novel states by adjusting its weights more rapidly over time.  The proposed approach has been evaluated through experiments performed in several different domains, including gridworld tasks, Montezuma's Revenge, and even StarCraft II games against human opponents. Results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across all types of tasks considered. Additionally, the authors analyze both the converged policies as well as transient behavior during training, shedding light into the decision making process of agents trained with our method. They find evidence of increased robustness and flexibility compared to prior approaches. These findings support the idea that combining dynamic boltzmann softmax updates with traditional RL techniques can lead to improved performance in complex problem spaces. Ultimately, the authors hope that their work will inspire further exploration into developing effective update mechanisms for RL systems.",1
"Large-scale public datasets have been shown to benefit research in multiple areas of modern artificial intelligence. For decision-making research that requires human data, high-quality datasets serve as important benchmarks to facilitate the development of new methods by providing a common reproducible standard. Many human decision-making tasks require visual attention to obtain high levels of performance. Therefore, measuring eye movements can provide a rich source of information about the strategies that humans use to solve decision-making tasks. Here, we provide a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human actions with simultaneously recorded eye movements while humans play Atari video games. The dataset consists of 117 hours of gameplay data from a diverse set of 20 games, with 8 million action demonstrations and 328 million gaze samples. We introduce a novel form of gameplay, in which the human plays in a semi-frame-by-frame manner. This leads to near-optimal game decisions and game scores that are comparable or better than known human records. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset through two simple applications: predicting human gaze and imitating human demonstrated actions. The quality of the data leads to promising results in both tasks. Moreover, using a learned human gaze model to inform imitation learning leads to an 115\% increase in game performance. We interpret these results as highlighting the importance of incorporating human visual attention in models of decision making and demonstrating the value of the current dataset to the research community.

While prior work has focused on either eye-tracking data alone [1] or demonstrations from expert players [4], our dataset combines both, enabling new types of analysis. To ensure high quality recordings across a wide range of skill levels, we recruited participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk with performance benchmarked against self-reported gaming experience. Each participant played a randomly assigned subset of twenty games for an average duration of 29 minutes per game. During play, their gaze was tracked using an eye tracker with a spatial resolution of <1° visual angle at 1 kHz. Recordings were synchronized with the display output allowing accurate temporal alignment with game events and states. Alongside raw gaze tracking data, we provide high-level summaries such as fixations, saccade lengths, time spent looking at each screen region and more detailed event-based analyses, including attention maps at each frame and heatmaps displaying peak accumulation of attention over multiple frames for different tasks. For comparison, we also present data collected from self-proclaimed expert players who voluntarily contributed their gameplay videos, which can serve as a reference baseline. Our dataset provides researchers with a valuable resource for studying how humans observe, perceive, react and make decisions while interacting with complex environments like video games. Additionally, it enables novel applications such as creating personalized adaptive difficulty adjustments based on individual player aptitude, evaluating user interfaces, training machine learning algorithms for predicting human behaviors, improving avatar control, among others. By making this dataset publicly available, we hope",1
"Maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated on a range of challenging continuous tasks. However, existing methods either suffer from severe instability when training on large off-policy data or cannot scale to tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion. Besides, the optimality of desired Boltzmann policy set for non-optimal soft value function is not persuasive enough. In this paper, we first derive soft policy gradient based on entropy regularized expected reward objective for RL with continuous actions. Then, we present an off-policy actor-critic, model-free maximum entropy deep RL algorithm called deep soft policy gradient (DSPG) by combining soft policy gradient with soft Bellman equation. To ensure stable learning while eliminating the need of two separate critics for soft value functions, we leverage double sampling approach to making the soft Bellman equation tractable. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms in performance over off-policy prior methods.",0
"Recent years have seen significant progress in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), due primarily to advances in both algorithmic design and parallel computing capabilities that support training on large neural networks. One particularly promising direction has been maximum entropy DRL, which seeks to maximize the entropy of the resulting policy while ensuring high reward performance. This approach provides a natural mechanism for exploration during training and can result in policies that are more robust and adaptive than those produced by classical methods. Here we propose a soft policy gradient method that integrates maximum entropy into model-free temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms in a principled manner. Our approach extends previous work by introducing three new components: an entropy-regularized TD error that encourages behavior consistent with maximum entropy; an adaptation of experience replay to stabilize learning under changing operating conditions; and stochastic linear approximation of the Q function that reduces computational overhead and improves sample efficiency. We evaluate our method on several benchmark continuous control tasks and show that it outperforms existing maximum entropy and soft policy gradient techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results across all domains tested. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness and flexibility of combining maximum entropy with model-free RL algorithms, opening up exciting opportunities for future research at the intersection of these two fields.",1
"Deep generative models have been praised for their ability to learn smooth latent representation of images, text, and audio, which can then be used to generate new, plausible data. However, current generative models are unable to work with molecular graphs due to their unique characteristics-their underlying structure is not Euclidean or grid-like, they remain isomorphic under permutation of the nodes labels, and they come with a different number of nodes and edges. In this paper, we first propose a novel variational autoencoder for molecular graphs, whose encoder and decoder are specially designed to account for the above properties by means of several technical innovations. Moreover, in contrast with the state of the art, our decoder is able to provide the spatial coordinates of the atoms of the molecules it generates. Then, we develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the decoder of our model so that it learns to generate molecules that maximize the value of certain property of interest and, given a molecule of interest, it is able to optimize the spatial configuration of its atoms for greater stability. Experiments reveal that our variational autoencoder can discover plausible, diverse and novel molecules more effectively than several state of the art models. Moreover, for several properties of interest, our optimized decoder is able to identify molecules with property values 121% higher than those identified by several state of the art methods based on Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning",0
"In this paper, we introduce Neural Variational Autoencoder (NeVAE), a deep generative model that can generate molecules with desired properties by predicting missing atoms and bonds within a given incomplete molecule graph. We train our model on large datasets of chemical compounds and use variational inference to learn latent representations of molecules. By optimizing a loss function that balances reconstruction accuracy and novelty, NeVAE generates high-quality and diverse molecular graphs that match specified criteria such as chemical logP values, maximum ring size, or minimum similarity to known drugs. Our experiments demonstrate that NeVAE outperforms previous methods for generating molecules with specific properties and is capable of discovering new chemically valid structures. Additionally, we evaluate NeVAE on drug discovery applications where it exhibits promising results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, NeVAE provides a powerful tool for rapidly exploring chemical space and accelerating the drug discovery process.",1
"Full-sampling (e.g., Q-learning) and pure-expectation (e.g., Expected Sarsa) algorithms are efficient and frequently used techniques in reinforcement learning. Q$(\sigma,\lambda)$ is the first approach unifies them with eligibility trace through the sampling degree $\sigma$. However, it is limited to the tabular case, for large-scale learning, the Q$(\sigma,\lambda)$ is too expensive to require a huge volume of tables to accurately storage value functions. To address above problem, we propose a GQ$(\sigma,\lambda)$ that extends tabular Q$(\sigma,\lambda)$ with linear function approximation. We prove the convergence of GQ$(\sigma,\lambda)$. Empirical results on some standard domains show that GQ$(\sigma,\lambda)$ with a combination of full-sampling with pure-expectation reach a better performance than full-sampling and pure-expectation methods.",0
"In this paper we present Gradient Q$(σ, λ)$, a unified algorithm that combines model-based reinforcement learning with function approximation, allowing agents to learn more efficiently from complex environments where state representation may require more parameters than can feasibly be stored in memory. Our method takes advantage of both methods by using a learned value function estimator to represent the action-value function, which allows for greater expressiveness while still providing a provably correct solution to the Bellman optimality equation. We show through experiments on a range of domains, including continuous control tasks, that our method outperforms previous algorithms that rely exclusively on either model-free or model-based approaches. Additionally, our gradient update rule allows for faster convergence and improved stability compared to alternative methods. Overall, our results demonstrate that combining model-based reinforcement learning with function approximation can lead to significant improvements in performance, even in difficult problem settings.

"Off-policy learning is powerful for reinforcement learning. However, the high variance of off-policy evaluation is a critical challenge, which causes off-policy learning falls into an uncontrolled instability. In this paper, for reducing the variance, we introduce control variate technique to $\mathtt{Expected}$ $\mathtt{Sarsa}$($\lambda$) and propose a tabular $\mathtt{ES}$($\lambda$)-$\mathtt{CV}$ algorithm. We prove that if a proper estimator of value function reaches, the proposed $\mathtt{ES}$($\lambda$)-$\mathtt{CV}$ enjoys a lower variance than $\mathtt{Expected}$ $\mathtt{Sarsa}$($\lambda$). Furthermore, to extend $\mathtt{ES}$($\lambda$)-$\mathtt{CV}$ to be a convergent algorithm with linear function approximation, we propose the $\mathtt{GES}$($\lambda$) algorithm under the convex-concave saddle-point formulation. We prove that the convergence rate of $\mathtt{GES}$($\lambda$) achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$, which matches or outperforms lots of state-of-art gradient-based algorithms, but we use a more relaxed condition. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs better with lower variance than several state-of-art gradient-based TD learning algorithms: $\mathtt{GQ}$($\lambda$), $\mathtt{GTB}$($\lambda$) and $\mathtt{ABQ}$($\zeta$).",0
"Abstract: This article presents the use of expected state-action value functions (Q-functions) and control variates to reduce variance while computing Monte Carlo estimates of performance metrics for discrete time Markov decision processes. We show how to apply these methods to the computation of policy evaluation metrics such as Q-learning targets (expected discounted sum of rewards). By introducing an additional ""control"" parameter that depends on current estimates we can effectively trade off bias and variance in the resulting estimators. Our approach leads to new families of efficient algorithms for which both asymptotic optimality and finite sample analysis are provided under mild conditions. Numerical experiments compare favorably against existing approaches demonstrating reductions in computational requirements by up to an order of magnitude.",1
"This work focuses on a specific classification problem, where the information about a sample is not readily available, but has to be acquired for a cost, and there is a per-sample budget. Inspired by real-world use-cases, we analyze average and hard variations of a directly specified budget. We postulate the problem in its explicit formulation and then convert it into an equivalent MDP, that can be solved with deep reinforcement learning. Also, we evaluate a real-world inspired setting with sparse training dataset with missing features. The presented method performs robustly well in all settings across several distinct datasets, outperforming other prior-art algorithms. The method is flexible, as showcased with all mentioned modifications and can be improved with any domain independent advancement in RL.",0
"One approach to machine learning models relies on using data that can be collected at very low cost, such as text available online or public databases. However, many applications require more specialized types of training data which may be expensive or impossible to obtain. This type of dataset often requires careful expertise and experimentation to collect and curate, so the resulting model trained from it will likely have better accuracy than those based only on cheap data. Our research takes advantage of datasets containing ""costly"" features, meaning they required special effort to acquire, by framing the problem as a sequential decision making task. We show how this formulation allows us to use reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complex classification problems, improving over existing approaches where costly features must simply be discarded. Finally we demonstrate our method through experiments on real-world image recognition tasks, showing significantly improved results over baseline models without costly features.",1
"Not all neural network architectures are created equal, some perform much better than others for certain tasks. But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

"This paper proposes a new methodology for training neural networks that addresses several shortcomings of traditional weighted architectures while providing improved performance on a variety of tasks. Our approach, which we refer to as ""weight agnostic neural networks"" (WANN), uses a simple yet effective mechanism to automatically determine the optimal number of neurons at each layer without relying on predefined weight constraints. By doing so, WANN overcomes the limitations imposed by fixed architecture sizes and enables deep learning models to better capture complex patterns and relationships within large datasets. In addition, our proposed method significantly reduces computational costs during both training and inference, making it suitable for real-world applications where resource efficiency is critical. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across several benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in many cases. Overall, these findings suggest that WANN has significant potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence and improve the accuracy of machine learning predictions in a wide range of domains.",1
"While many recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) rely on model-free methods, model-based approaches remain an alluring prospect for their potential to exploit unsupervised data to learn environment model. In this work, we provide an extensive study on the design of deep generative models for RL environments and propose a sample efficient and robust method to learn the model of Atari environments. We deploy this model and propose generative adversarial tree search (GATS) a deep RL algorithm that learns the environment model and implements Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) on the learned model for planning. While MCTS on the learned model is computationally expensive, similar to AlphaGo, GATS follows depth limited MCTS. GATS employs deep Q network (DQN) and learns a Q-function to assign values to the leaves of the tree in MCTS. We theoretical analyze GATS vis-a-vis the bias-variance trade-off and show GATS is able to mitigate the worst-case error in the Q-estimate. While we were expecting GATS to enjoy a better sample complexity and faster converges to better policies, surprisingly, GATS fails to outperform DQN. We provide a study on which we show why depth limited MCTS fails to perform desirably.",0
"We report on experiments using generative adversarial tree search (GATS) to optimize game playing agents. In our main experiment we compare GATS against two other state-of-the-art methods, Monte Carlo Tree Search and AlphaGo Zero. Against these strong baselines, we were surprised to find that GATS did not achieve better performance than random play despite our efforts at hyperparameter tuning. Our results have implications for both understanding deep learning approaches to game playing and selecting algorithms for optimizing agents more broadly. This work provides a first step towards understanding why some modern machine learning techniques fail to perform as expected when transferred from simulation to real-world settings. We provide detailed analysis including ablation studies which show that some architectural choices made by the original authors of GATS may explain their success while making generalization harder.",1
"Many real-world systems problems require reasoning about the long term consequences of actions taken to configure and manage the system. These problems with delayed and often sequentially aggregated reward, are often inherently reinforcement learning problems and present the opportunity to leverage the recent substantial advances in deep reinforcement learning. However, in some cases, it is not clear why deep reinforcement learning is a good fit for the problem. Sometimes, it does not perform better than the state-of-the-art solutions. And in other cases, random search or greedy algorithms could outperform deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we review, discuss, and evaluate the recent trends of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. We propose a set of essential metrics to guide future works in evaluating the efficacy of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. Our evaluation includes challenges, the types of problems, their formulation in the deep reinforcement learning setting, embedding, the model used, efficiency, and robustness. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and potential directions for pushing further the integration of reinforcement learning in system optimization.",0
"This paper presents a view on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a tool for system optimization. DRL has emerged as a promising technique for solving complex problems that involve decision making under uncertainty. In particular, the use of deep neural networks enables DRL algorithms to learn optimal policies from large amounts of data.  The authors argue that DRL can be particularly effective in system optimization tasks where traditional methods may fall short. They highlight several examples of successful applications of DRL in systems such as traffic management, energy consumption reduction, and control of autonomous vehicles. These success stories demonstrate the potential benefits of using DRL to optimize systems that have multiple objectives, are highly dynamic, or require real-time decision making.  However, the authors acknowledge that there are still challenges associated with applying DRL to real-world systems. One major challenge is ensuring the interpretability and explainability of decisions made by DRL models. Another important issue is dealing with high sample complexity, which can make training prohibitively expensive in some cases.  Despite these challenges, the authors remain optimistic about the future prospects of DRL in system optimization. They suggest that advances in model architecture design, algorithmic improvements, and efficient training techniques could further enhance the performance of DRL models. Ultimately, they believe that DRL holds great promise for addressing complex system optimization problems across various domains.",1
"In this paper we present Horizon, Facebook's open source applied reinforcement learning (RL) platform. Horizon is an end-to-end platform designed to solve industry applied RL problems where datasets are large (millions to billions of observations), the feedback loop is slow (vs. a simulator), and experiments must be done with care because they don't run in a simulator. Unlike other RL platforms, which are often designed for fast prototyping and experimentation, Horizon is designed with production use cases as top of mind. The platform contains workflows to train popular deep RL algorithms and includes data preprocessing, feature transformation, distributed training, counterfactual policy evaluation, optimized serving, and a model-based data understanding tool.

"""Horizon: An Overview""  In recent years, there has been growing interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), particularly in the area of reinforcement learning (RL). RL involves training agents to make decisions based on feedback from their environment, using algorithms that maximize cumulative reward over time. This technique can be used to solve complex problems in a wide range of domains, including computer games, robotics, finance, healthcare, and more.  One of the challenges facing researchers and practitioners working in RL is the lack of accessible tools and frameworks for building and deploying applications at scale. To address this issue, Facebook developed Horizon, an open source platform designed specifically for applied RL workloads.  This article provides an overview of Horizon and describes how it makes RL easier and faster by providing a scalable infrastructure for managing large numbers of parallel simulation environments, automatic differentiation, model saving/loading, distributed training, and other features. We present use cases showing how Horizon has been successfully applied in industry, discuss limitations of current approaches, and provide insights into future directions for RL research and development.  Overall, we hope that sharing our knowledge and experience through this paper will help accelerate progress in the field and encourage others to contribute to the growth and success of the open source community around Horizon.",1
"The design of neural network architectures is frequently either based on human expertise using trial/error and empirical feedback or tackled via large scale reinforcement learning strategies performed over distinct discrete architecture choices. In the latter case, the optimization is often non-differentiable and also not very amenable to derivative-free optimization methods. Most methods in use today require sizable computational resources. And if we want networks that additionally satisfy resource constraints, the above challenges are exacerbated because the search must now balance accuracy with certain budget constraints on resources. We formulate this problem as the optimization of a set function -- we find that the empirical behavior of this set function often (but not always) satisfies marginal gain and monotonicity principles -- properties central to the idea of submodularity. Based on this observation, we adapt algorithms within discrete optimization to obtain heuristic schemes for neural network architecture search, where we have resource constraints on the architecture. This simple scheme when applied on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, identifies resource-constrained architectures with quantifiably better performance than current state-of-the-art models designed for mobile devices. Specifically, we find high-performing architectures with fewer parameters and computations by a search method that is much faster.",0
"Automatically designing neural network architectures has been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on many tasks, but requires significant computational resources. We study the effectiveness of using submodular optimization methods to reduce the computational cost while maintaining the quality of the discovered architectures. Our method iteratively improves the architecture by adding one operation at a time; each step increases a matheuristic objective function that combines proxy metrics (e.g., validation accuracy) with diversity measures inspired from human designed architectures (e.g., distance to nearest repeated operation). We introduce three families of models whose properties we leverage to develop our framework: ensembles of pruned architectures obtained via regularization, linear models that predict performance on CIFAR-10 as a function of the number of operations/parameters, and interpretable decision trees trained to predict whether removing an operation leads to higher or lower accuracy. Through extensive experiments over several datasets and model classes, we find that making a submodularity assumption greatly reduces the search space without sacrificing the resulting performance; indeed our new approach often achieves higher accuracy than prior work with fewer parameters, even when not assuming submodularity. These promising results suggest potential applications well beyond computer vision, such as drug discovery or protein structure prediction where evaluating candidate solutions can be computationally expensive and iterative improvement procedures may be beneficial. Overall, automating the discovery of complex structures without relying on vast computational resources could change how researchers interact with machine learning systems, enabling creativity and serendipitous discoveries through flexible problem formulation, rather than laborious trial and error. Future work includes extending these ideas to continual lifelong learning scenarios where previously learned models must be forgotten, which further stresses the importance of scalable acquisition functions. In addition, we aim t",1
"Deep learning algorithms often require solving a highly non-linear and nonconvex unconstrained optimization problem. Methods for solving optimization problems in large-scale machine learning, such as deep learning and deep reinforcement learning (RL), are generally restricted to the class of first-order algorithms, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). While SGD iterates are inexpensive to compute, they have slow theoretical convergence rates. Furthermore, they require exhaustive trial-and-error to fine-tune many learning parameters. Using second-order curvature information to find search directions can help with more robust convergence for non-convex optimization problems. However, computing Hessian matrices for large-scale problems is not computationally practical. Alternatively, quasi-Newton methods construct an approximate of the Hessian matrix to build a quadratic model of the objective function. Quasi-Newton methods, like SGD, require only first-order gradient information, but they can result in superlinear convergence, which makes them attractive alternatives to SGD. The limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) approach is one of the most popular quasi-Newton methods that construct positive definite Hessian approximations. In this chapter, we propose efficient optimization methods based on L-BFGS quasi-Newton methods using line search and trust-region strategies. Our methods bridge the disparity between first- and second-order methods by using gradient information to calculate low-rank updates to Hessian approximations. We provide formal convergence analysis of these methods as well as empirical results on deep learning applications, such as image classification tasks and deep reinforcement learning on a set of ATARI 2600 video games. Our results show a robust convergence with preferred generalization characteristics as well as fast training time.",0
"In this research paper, we propose a new method for optimizing deep learning models that utilizes Quasi-Newton optimization methods. These methods have been shown to be highly effective at solving large-scale optimization problems in other fields, but have not yet been widely applied to deep learning due to their computational complexity. However, our experiments show that they can provide significant improvements over traditional gradient descent based methods, particularly on problems where precision and efficiency are critical such as computer vision and natural language processing tasks. We present several case studies demonstrating the efficacy of our approach across different datasets and model architectures. Our work provides important insights into the use of these algorithms for training complex machine learning systems, paving the way for future advances in the field.",1
"One of the major challenges in training deep architectures for predictive tasks is the scarcity and cost of labeled training data. Active Learning (AL) is one way of addressing this challenge. In stream-based AL, observations are continuously made available to the learner that have to decide whether to request a label or to make a prediction. The goal is to reduce the request rate while at the same time maximize prediction performance. In previous research, reinforcement learning has been used for learning the AL request/prediction strategy. In our work, we propose to equip a reinforcement learning process with memory augmented neural networks, to enhance the one-shot capabilities. Moreover, we introduce Class Margin Sampling (CMS) as an extension of the standard margin sampling to the reinforcement learning setting. This strategy aims to reduce training time and improve sample efficiency in the training process. We evaluate the proposed method on a classification task using empirical accuracy of label predictions and percentage of label requests. The results indicates that the proposed method, by making use of the memory augmented networks and CMS in the training process, outperforms existing baselines.",0
"Active one-shot learning (AOSL) involves adaptively selecting which instances to label from a large pool during training to reduce data collection costs while maintaining high model accuracy. However, current state-of-the-art methods rely on storing the entire dataset during active selection, which can become prohibitively expensive given limited memory resources. To address this limitation, we propose augmented memory networks for streaming-based AOSL, where only small portions of the original data stream are stored at any time. Our method uses attention mechanisms to select informative instances as they arrive, rather than relying solely on stored instances. We introduce a novel memory module that continuously updates itself by filtering previously seen instances based on their relevance to the current task. By balancing storage cost against the need to encode important features, our method achieves better results compared to baselines across multiple benchmark datasets, with even greater improvements seen under severe resource constraints. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining streaming techniques with deep neural networks to enhance efficient active learning scenarios.",1
"Automatic neural architecture design has shown its potential in discovering powerful neural network architectures. Existing methods, no matter based on reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms (EA), conduct architecture search in a discrete space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design based on continuous optimization. We call this new approach neural architecture optimization (NAO). There are three key components in our proposed approach: (1) An encoder embeds/maps neural network architectures into a continuous space. (2) A predictor takes the continuous representation of a network as input and predicts its accuracy. (3) A decoder maps a continuous representation of a network back to its architecture. The performance predictor and the encoder enable us to perform gradient based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of a new architecture with potentially better accuracy. Such a better embedding is then decoded to a network by the decoder. Experiments show that the architecture discovered by our method is very competitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling task on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous architecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational resources. Specifically we obtain 1.93% test set error rate for CIFAR-10 image classification task and 56.0 test set perplexity of PTB language modeling task. Furthermore, combined with the recent proposed weight sharing mechanism, we discover powerful architecture on CIFAR-10 (with error rate 2.93%) and on PTB (with test set perplexity 56.6), with very limited computational resources (less than 10 GPU hours) for both tasks.",0

We discuss the motivations behind NAO and describe several approaches that have been proposed in the literature. We also highlight some of the challenges facing researchers working in this area, including the computational cost of evaluation and the difficulty of evaluating the quality of discovered architectures without resorting to benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude by outlining potential directions for future research in NAO.",1
"While Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches lead to significant achievements in a variety of areas in recent history, natural language tasks remained mostly unaffected, due to the compositional and combinatorial nature that makes them notoriously hard to optimize. With the emerging field of Text-Based Games (TBGs), researchers try to bridge this gap. Inspired by the success of RL algorithms on Atari games, the idea is to develop new methods in a restricted game world and then gradually move to more complex environments. Previous work in the area of TBGs has mainly focused on solving individual games. We, however, consider the task of designing an agent that not just succeeds in a single game, but performs well across a whole family of games, sharing the same theme. In this work, we present our deep RL agent--LeDeepChef--that shows generalization capabilities to never-before-seen games of the same family with different environments and task descriptions. The agent participated in Microsoft Research's ""First TextWorld Problems: A Language and Reinforcement Learning Challenge"" and outperformed all but one competitor on the final test set. The games from the challenge all share the same theme, namely cooking in a modern house environment, but differ significantly in the arrangement of the rooms, the presented objects, and the specific goal (recipe to cook). To build an agent that achieves high scores across a whole family of games, we use an actor-critic framework and prune the action-space by using ideas from hierarchical reinforcement learning and a specialized module trained on a recipe database.",0
"Here is a possible abstract for your paper on ""LeDeepChef: Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Families of Text-Based Games"".  Text adventure games have been a popular genre since their introduction over two decades ago, generating billions of lines of code that can become repetitive or tedious tasks for human programmers to analyze line by line. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great potential to automate such complex analysis tasks, but current approaches rely heavily on large amounts of game data as input, making them impractical for use by smaller teams creating indie text-based adventures without access to massive datasets. This paper introduces a new approach based on reinforcement learning from demonstrations (RLfD) using deep neural networks to learn how to create and refine content for small text-based games. Our approach trains agents to generate novel solutions using only a few demonstration interactions rather than requiring millions of labeled examples and generates outputs faster than traditional RL models while still providing high accuracy. By enabling developers to quickly produce content at scale, our method allows them more time to focus on designing compelling narratives instead of laboriously implementing mechanics one interaction at a time. We showcase the effectiveness of our agent through several case studies involving classic interactive fiction titles like Zork and Curses and demonstrate how our model achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art DQN baselines on larger domains but requires significantly less training time and computational resources. Overall, we believe our work advances research towards developing efficient generative AI tools that enable content creators without vast budgets to build immersive worlds for players to explore and enjoy.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms allow artificial agents to improve their selection of actions to increase rewarding experiences in their environments. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning -- a model-free RL method -- is a leading account of the midbrain dopamine system and the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning. These algorithms typically learn a mapping from the agent's current sensed state to a selected action (known as a policy function) via learning a value function (expected future rewards). TD Learning methods have been very successful on a broad range of control tasks, but learning can become intractably slow as the state space of the environment grows. This has motivated methods that learn internal representations of the agent's state, effectively reducing the size of the state space and restructuring state representations in order to support generalization. However, TD Learning coupled with an artificial neural network, as a function approximator, has been shown to fail to learn some fairly simple control tasks, challenging this explanation of reward-based learning. We hypothesize that such failures do not arise in the brain because of the ubiquitous presence of lateral inhibition in the cortex, producing sparse distributed internal representations that support the learning of expected future reward. The sparse conjunctive representations can avoid catastrophic interference while still supporting generalization. We provide support for this conjecture through computational simulations, demonstrating the benefits of learned sparse representations for three problematic classic control tasks: Puddle-world, Mountain-car, and Acrobot.",0
"In this paper we propose a novel method for learning sparse representations in reinforcement learning (RL). RL algorithms often suffer from high dimensional state spaces which can lead to prohibitive memory usage during training and poor sample efficiency. To address these issues, we use a regularization term that encourages learned policies to rely only on a small number of features present within the state. Our approach builds upon recent work in deep reinforcement learning by incorporating sparsity constraints directly into the policy update rule. This allows us to optimize both for policy accuracy and sparsity simultaneously. We demonstrate through empirical evaluation that our proposed method results in significant improvements over standard methods in terms of sample efficiency and policy performance across several benchmark tasks. The simplicity of our approach makes it applicable to many domains where highdimensional state spaces pose a challenge for traditional RL techniques.",1
"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to complement the 5G communication infrastructure in future smart cities. Hot spots easily appear in road intersections, where effective communication among vehicles is challenging. UAVs may serve as relays with the advantages of low price, easy deployment, line-of-sight links, and flexible mobility. In this paper, we study a UAV-assisted vehicular network where the UAV jointly adjusts its transmission control (power and channel) and 3D flight to maximize the total throughput. First, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem by modeling the mobility of the UAV/vehicles and the state transitions. Secondly, we solve the target problem using a deep reinforcement learning method under unknown or unmeasurable environment variables especially in 5G, namely, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and propose three solutions with different control objectives. Environment variables are unknown and unmeasurable, therefore, we use a deep reinforcement learning method. Moreover, considering the energy consumption of 3D flight, we extend the proposed solutions to maximize the total throughput per energy unit by encouraging or discouraging the UAV's mobility. To achieve this goal, the DDPG framework is modified. Thirdly, in a simplified model with small state space and action space, we verify the optimality of proposed algorithms. Comparing with two baseline schemes, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms in a realistic model.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). UAV-assisted vehicular networks have emerged as a promising solution for improving network performance by providing efficient data transmission between vehicles on the ground. However, traditional methods for controlling UAV movements in these networks suffer from several limitations, such as poor scalability, high computational complexity, and lack of adaptability.  In this work, we propose a DRL-based method that enables UAVs to learn optimal movement policies based on real-time traffic situations. Our approach leverages advanced DRL algorithms to enable UAVs to make decisions regarding their positions, altitudes, and velocities in order to maximize network efficiency while minimizing interference caused by other airborne devices. We evaluate our method through comprehensive simulations that demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing techniques in terms of network coverage, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency, and energy consumption.  Overall, our research shows that the integration of DRL into UAV communication networks represents a significant step towards enabling self-organized, intelligent transportation systems that can significantly improve road safety and reduce traffic congestion.

"In E-commerce advertising, where product recommendations and product ads are presented to users simultaneously, the traditional setting is to display ads at fixed positions. However, under such a setting, the advertising system loses the flexibility to control the number and positions of ads, resulting in sub-optimal platform revenue and user experience. Consequently, major e-commerce platforms (e.g., Taobao.com) have begun to consider more flexible ways to display ads. In this paper, we investigate the problem of advertising with adaptive exposure: can we dynamically determine the number and positions of ads for each user visit under certain business constraints so that the platform revenue can be increased? More specifically, we consider two types of constraints: request-level constraint ensures user experience for each user visit, and platform-level constraint controls the overall platform monetization rate. We model this problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process with per-state constraint (psCMDP) and propose a constrained two-level reinforcement learning approach to decompose the original problem into two relatively independent sub-problems. To accelerate policy learning, we also devise a constrained hindsight experience replay mechanism. Experimental evaluations on industry-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the merits of our approach in both obtaining higher revenue under the constraints and the effectiveness of the constrained hindsight experience replay mechanism.",0
"Title: Improving Online Ad Engagement through Personalized Exposure Control  Online advertising has become increasingly important for businesses seeking to reach their target audiences. However, one key challenge facing the industry is ensuring that ads are displayed at optimal levels, so as to maximize engagement without overexposing users. This study proposes a new approach to address this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust display exposure based on user behavior and preferences.  Our method involves analyzing data from multiple sources including clicks, impressions, conversion rates, and other metrics related to online activity. These data points are then used to build individual models predicting the likelihood that specific users will interact positively with certain types of advertisements. By incorporating these predictions into our display algorithms, we can automatically determine how often and under which circumstances each person should see an ad.  The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive approach. Compared to traditional static strategies, our system yields significant improvements across several critical measures such as click-through rate (CTR), cost per acquisition (CPA), and return on investment (ROI). Furthermore, we observe that users exposed to personalized campaigns exhibit higher levels of satisfaction and intent to purchase. Overall, these findings suggest that intelligent exposure control has the potential to greatly enhance the impact of real-time advertising while minimizing negative experiences for internet users.  In conclusion, this research presents a promising solution towards optimizing the balance between ad visibility and consumer interest. Our work opens up exciting opportunities for further exploration into artificial intelligence applications within the digital marketing domain. As technology continues to advance, we envision future systems capable of even more granular customization, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for both advertisers and consumers alike.",1
"Reinforcement learning algorithms are gaining popularity in fields in which optimal scheduling is important, and oncology is not an exception. The complex and uncertain dynamics of cancer limit the performance of traditional model-based scheduling strategies like Optimal Control. Motivated by the recent success of model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in challenging control tasks and in the design of medical treatments, we use Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to design a personalized cancer chemotherapy schedule. We show that both of them succeed in the task and outperform the Optimal Control solution in the presence of uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that DDPG can exterminate cancer more efficiently than DQN presumably due to its continuous action space. Finally, we provide some insight regarding the amount of samples required for the training.",0
"Personalized cancer chemotherapy treatment involves determining the optimal schedule of doses that maximizes efficacy while minimizing side effects. Model-based methods rely on mathematical models of tumor growth dynamics and pharmacokinetics (drug absorption/distribution) to predict treatment outcomes based on patient data such as body size, drug tolerance, etc. This study compares two model-based methods, a classical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique, which assumes lognormal growth rates, and a more recent nonlinear least squares (NLS) approach; these are compared against three commonly used empirical, model-free schedules. Performance metrics include: time to reach a specific target volume or threshold; total number of cycles required to achieve remission; overall survival. For robustness analysis, sensitivity of each method’s output is evaluated when small perturbations are added to input variables (e.g., slightly different estimates of initial tumor volumes). Results suggest significant advantages in using personalized chemotherapy treatment plans generated from either MLE or NLS approaches over standard model-free protocols, demonstrating increased efficiency and reduced variability across multiple performance metrics. Further investigation explores sources of uncertainty in modeling parameters and potential clinical implications arising from imprecise estimations.

Our approach combines techniques from algebraic topology, synthetic differential geometry, and deep learning, providing insights into both classical and quantum computing problems. By bridging logical foundations with geometric intuition and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technology, our work opens up new avenues for researchers across multiple fields of inquiry. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of interdisciplinary collaboration towards solving complex modern challenges within science.",1
"Cancer is a complex disease, the understanding and treatment of which are being aided through increases in the volume of collected data and in the scale of deployed computing power. Consequently, there is a growing need for the development of data-driven and, in particular, deep learning methods for various tasks such as cancer diagnosis, detection, prognosis, and prediction. Despite recent successes, however, designing high-performing deep learning models for nonimage and nontext cancer data is a time-consuming, trial-and-error, manual task that requires both cancer domain and deep learning expertise. To that end, we develop a reinforcement-learning-based neural architecture search to automate deep-learning-based predictive model development for a class of representative cancer data. We develop custom building blocks that allow domain experts to incorporate the cancer-data-specific characteristics. We show that our approach discovers deep neural network architectures that have significantly fewer trainable parameters, shorter training time, and accuracy similar to or higher than those of manually designed architectures. We study and demonstrate the scalability of our approach on up to 1,024 Intel Knights Landing nodes of the Theta supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility.",0
"Title: ""Scalable Reinforcement Learning Based Neural Architecture Search for Medical Image Analysis""  Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise for solving complex medical image analysis problems such as cancer diagnosis. However, designing and training effective neural networks for these tasks can be challenging due to the large number of hyperparameters involved. In this work, we present a scalable reinforcement learning based method for automatically searching through the vast space of possible network architectures. Our approach uses a combination of proxy metrics and hierarchical exploration to efficiently identify high performing models that generalize well across different datasets. We validate our method using three benchmark medical imaging datasets and demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the art performance while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to prior methods. This work represents an important step towards enabling rapid advancements in medical image analysis through automated architecture search.",1
"Visual paragraph generation aims to automatically describe a given image from different perspectives and organize sentences in a coherent way. In this paper, we address three critical challenges for this task in a reinforcement learning setting: the mode collapse, the delayed feedback, and the time-consuming warm-up for policy networks. Generally, we propose a novel Curiosity-driven Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework to jointly enhance the diversity and accuracy of the generated paragraphs. First, by modeling the paragraph captioning as a long-term decision-making process and measuring the prediction uncertainty of state transitions as intrinsic rewards, the model is incentivized to memorize precise but rarely spotted descriptions to context, rather than being biased towards frequent fragments and generic patterns. Second, since the extrinsic reward from evaluation is only available until the complete paragraph is generated, we estimate its expected value at each time step with temporal-difference learning, by considering the correlations between successive actions. Then the estimated extrinsic rewards are complemented by dense intrinsic rewards produced from the derived curiosity module, in order to encourage the policy to fully explore action space and find a global optimum. Third, discounted imitation learning is integrated for learning from human demonstrations, without separately performing the time-consuming warm-up in advance. Extensive experiments conducted on the Standford image-paragraph dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, improving the performance by 38.4% compared with state-of-the-art.",0
"Aiming at text generation tasks that require high diversity, we propose Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning (CDRL), which enables agents to learn from self-exploration guided by curiosity. Inspired by human behavior, our approach models stochastic policies as distributions over actions and introduces a novel algorithm based on Thompson Sampling and Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) for policy optimization. Experimental results show that CDRL significantly outperforms strong baselines such as REINFORCE, AWAC, and IWAE across different metrics, including FID and KL divergence, demonstrating superior performance under both low and high resource settings. Our analysis reveals that NCE helps mitigate model collapse during training while adaptively adjusting exploration, providing insights into designing effective offline RL algorithms for computer vision tasks like image generation. This work extends previous efforts on applying intrinsic motivation to address challenges associated with visual generation problems where abundant feedback or precise rewards are difficult to obtain.",1
"In this paper, we settle the sampling complexity of solving discounted two-player turn-based zero-sum stochastic games up to polylogarithmic factors. Given a stochastic game with discount factor $\gamma\in(0,1)$ we provide an algorithm that computes an $\epsilon$-optimal strategy with high-probability given $\tilde{O}((1 - \gamma)^{-3} \epsilon^{-2})$ samples from the transition function for each state-action-pair. Our algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of samples and uses space nearly linear in the number of state-action pairs. As stochastic games generalize Markov decision processes (MDPs) our runtime and sample complexities are optimal due to Azar et al (2013). We achieve our results by showing how to generalize a near-optimal Q-learning based algorithms for MDP, in particular Sidford et al (2018), to two-player strategy computation algorithms. This overcomes limitations of standard Q-learning and strategy iteration or alternating minimization based approaches and we hope will pave the way for future reinforcement learning results by facilitating the extension of MDP results to multi-agent settings with little loss.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in solving stochastic two-player games with near-optimal time complexity. However, most existing methods suffer from either high sample complexity or poor theoretical guarantees on their optimality. This paper addresses these limitations by presenting a new algorithm that achieves both near-optimal time and sample complexities for solving discounted stochastic two-player games. Our approach is based on the recently introduced concept of mean-payoff vector potentials, which provide a compact representation of game solutions. We show that our method converges to an $\epsilon$-NE (nearly optimal) solution within $O\big(T \log(HSA/\epsilon)\big)$ episodes and $O\big(\frac{H^2 S T}{\epsilon}\log(SAT/\epsilon)\big)$ samples per episode, where $H$ is the size of the action spaces for both players, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the size of the action space for one player, $T$ is the length of the shortest path to reach absorbing states, and $*$ denotes taking maximum over all possible vectors. Additionally, we prove tight upper bounds for the time and sample complexities of solving general Markov decision processes with respect to arbitrary Bellman operators. Our results demonstrate the power of combining insights from the theory of stochastic processes with modern machine learning techniques, paving the way for efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale games with real-time applications such as autonomous systems and cyber security.",1
"This paper proposes a Transformer-based model to generate equations for math word problems. It achieves much better results than RNN models when copy and align mechanisms are not used, and can outperform complex copy and align RNN models. We also show that training a Transformer jointly in a generation task with two decoders, left-to-right and right-to-left, is beneficial. Such a Transformer performs better than the one with just one decoder not only because of the ensemble effect, but also because it improves the encoder training procedure. We also experiment with adding reinforcement learning to our model, showing improved performance compared to MLE training.",0

"Anomaly detection is widely applied in a variety of domains, involving for instance, smart home systems, network traffic monitoring, IoT applications and sensor networks. In this paper, we study deep reinforcement learning based active sequential testing for anomaly detection. We assume that there is an unknown number of abnormal processes at a time and the agent can only check with one sensor in each sampling step. To maximize the confidence level of the decision and minimize the stopping time concurrently, we propose a deep actor-critic reinforcement learning framework that can dynamically select the sensor based on the posterior probabilities. We provide simulation results for both the training phase and testing phase, and compare the proposed framework with the Chernoff test in terms of claim delay and loss.",0
"Here we propose a new method called deep actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) that is designed to detect anomalies by using both supervised learning and RL techniques. Our approach uses two neural networks: an actor network and a critic network. The actor network learns a policy that maps states to actions, while the critic network evaluates the state-action values. We train these networks jointly, where the target value function is represented as a combination of the cross entropy loss from supervised training and a temporal difference error term derived from RL. This allows us to learn both short-term rewards and long-term dependencies crucial for anomaly detection. In our experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our proposed model achieves significantly better performance compared to traditional approaches such as PCA and autoencoders. Additionally, ablation studies demonstrate the importance of each component in the proposed framework. These results indicate that deep actor-critic RL could potentially provide an effective solution for real-world applications such as fraud detection and surveillance systems.",1
"We study algorithms for average-cost reinforcement learning problems with value function approximation. Our starting point is the recently proposed POLITEX algorithm, a version of policy iteration where the policy produced in each iteration is near-optimal in hindsight for the sum of all past value function estimates. POLITEX has sublinear regret guarantees in uniformly-mixing MDPs when the value estimation error can be controlled, which can be satisfied if all policies sufficiently explore the environment. Unfortunately, this assumption is often unrealistic. Motivated by the rapid growth of interest in developing policies that learn to explore their environment in the lack of rewards (also known as no-reward learning), we replace the previous assumption that all policies explore the environment with that a single, sufficiently exploring policy is available beforehand. The main contribution of the paper is the modification of POLITEX to incorporate such an exploration policy in a way that allows us to obtain a regret guarantee similar to the previous one but without requiring that all policies explore environment. In addition to the novel theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate the benefits of our scheme on environments which are difficult to explore using simple schemes like dithering. While the solution we obtain may not achieve the best possible regret, it is the first result that shows how to control the regret in the presence of function approximation errors on problems where exploration is nontrivial. Our approach can also be seen as a way of reducing the problem of minimizing the regret to learning a good exploration policy. We believe that modular approaches like ours can be highly beneficial in tackling harder control problems.",0
"In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has progressed rapidly, leading to significant advancements in many fields, including natural language processing (NLP). One important aspect of NLP research focuses on text generation, which involves creating coherent sentences or paragraphs based on given input. Although there have been numerous efforts towards developing effective generative models for this task, few have attempted to integrate exploratory search techniques into the process. This paper introduces Exploration-Enhanced POLITEX, a novel approach that combines state-of-the-art NLP methods with active search strategies, resulting in more diverse and relevant output.  The proposed model consists of two main components: a pre-trained sequence generator and an exploration module. The generator utilizes a policy gradient reinforcement learning framework to optimize the generated sequence based on the likelihood of observing a particular target sentence. Meanwhile, the exploration module employs an uncertainty sampling technique to identify critical regions during the inference process. These uncertain areas serve as guidelines for conducting targeted searches from external knowledge sources, ensuring the diversity and relevance of the final output.  To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments using several benchmark datasets commonly used in NLP research. Our results showed that the Exploration-Enhanced POLITEX outperformed existing baseline models across all evaluation metrics, indicating its superior capability in generating diverse and relevant output. Additionally, analyses of individual cases further confirmed the impact of the exploration module on enhancing the quality of generated content.

"Using touch devices to navigate in virtual 3D environments such as computer assisted design (CAD) models or geographical information systems (GIS) is inherently difficult for humans, as the 3D operations have to be performed by the user on a 2D touch surface. This ill-posed problem is classically solved with a fixed and handcrafted interaction protocol, which must be learned by the user. We propose to automatically learn a new interaction protocol allowing to map a 2D user input to 3D actions in virtual environments using reinforcement learning (RL). A fundamental problem of RL methods is the vast amount of interactions often required, which are difficult to come by when humans are involved. To overcome this limitation, we make use of two collaborative agents. The first agent models the human by learning to perform the 2D finger trajectories. The second agent acts as the interaction protocol, interpreting and translating to 3D operations the 2D finger trajectories from the first agent. We restrict the learned 2D trajectories to be similar to a training set of collected human gestures by first performing state representation learning, prior to reinforcement learning. This state representation learning is addressed by projecting the gestures into a latent space learned by a variational auto encoder (VAE).",0

Our results indicate that cooperative multi-agent RL can successfully learn navigation protocols in complex environments. Additionally, our findings suggest that the use of touch interfaces may have a positive impact on the efficiency of the learned protocols. These findings contribute new insights into the potential applications of RL in real-world settings and offer valuable guidance for future research.",1
"Imitation learning is an effective alternative approach to learn a policy when the reward function is sparse. In this paper, we consider a challenging setting where an agent and an expert use different actions from each other. We assume that the agent has access to a sparse reward function and state-only expert observations. We propose a method which gradually balances between the imitation learning cost and the reinforcement learning objective. In addition, this method adapts the agent's policy based on either mimicking expert behavior or maximizing sparse reward. We show, through navigation scenarios, that (i) an agent is able to efficiently leverage sparse rewards to outperform standard state-only imitation learning, (ii) it can learn a policy even when its actions are different from the expert, and (iii) the performance of the agent is not bounded by that of the expert, due to the optimized usage of sparse rewards.",0

"Abstract: Adversarial learning has gained popularity as a promising approach towards improving reinforcement learning algorithms by incorporating an opponent model that learns from interactions with the environment.

"Urban spatial-temporal flows prediction is of great importance to traffic management, land use, public safety, etc. Urban flows are affected by several complex and dynamic factors, such as patterns of human activities, weather, events and holidays. Datasets evaluated the flows come from various sources in different domains, e.g. mobile phone data, taxi trajectories data, metro/bus swiping data, bike-sharing data and so on. To summarize these methodologies of urban flows prediction, in this paper, we first introduce four main factors affecting urban flows. Second, in order to further analysis urban flows, a preparation process of multi-sources spatial-temporal data related with urban flows is partitioned into three groups. Third, we choose the spatial-temporal dynamic data as a case study for the urban flows prediction task. Fourth, we analyze and compare some well-known and state-of-the-art flows prediction methods in detail, classifying them into five categories: statistics-based, traditional machine learning-based, deep learning-based, reinforcement learning-based and transfer learning-based methods.

"In recent years, there has been significant progress in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), particularly through the development of advanced algorithms that can handle complex tasks with high efficiency and accuracy. One such algorithmic approach is adaptive multiscale value function approximation (AMVFA). AMVFA utilizes a coarse-to-fine strategy where the global solution is approximated by gradually refining subproblems at different levels of resolution. This results in efficient use of computational resources while maintaining good convergence rates. However, previous studies have identified issues with unstable convergence and slow convergence rate in some scenarios. This study addresses these limitations by investigating the impact of varying convergence criteria on the performance of AMVFA in multiple simulated environments. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate improved stability and faster convergence compared to existing methods. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of AMVFA under different conditions, as well as new perspectives on how to optimize its performance for more effective use in RL applications.

"Title: ""Assessing Safety and Efficiency In Probabilistic Environments""  Abstract:  Learning to make decisions in uncertain environments has been a challenge since the inception of artificial intelligence (AI). Since then, numerous attempts have been made at developing algorithms capable of efficiently learning policies that maximize reward while minimizing risk under uncertainty. However, defining and measuring risk remains a difficult task as traditional measures such as variance may not fully capture all sources of uncertainty. As such, new approaches towards assessing safety must take into account more nuanced aspects of variability such as skewness and kurtosis. Furthermore, these methods should enable better control over exploration vs exploitation tradeoffs to ensure both efficiency and safety in decision making. This paper addresses some of the challenges faced by state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms when operating in probabilistic scenarios. To overcome these limitations we develop practical risk measures which better approximate real world uncertainties associated with probability distributions encountered during deployment. By utilising a combination of risk metrics, our approach balances both exploratory search behaviours alongside cautious deliberation based on estimated risks. We empirically evaluate performance across several domains and demonstrate substantial improvements through comparison against baseline methods. Results show improved success rates and reduction of failure cases allowing safer deployments into complex real world problems. Through an investigation of the efficacy of our risk measures, researchers can further refine their understanding of how to balance safety and performance within uncertain enviroments. We conclude discussions with directions future work could take to support real world implementation of safe reinforcement learnin",1
"The performance of many algorithms in the fields of hard combinatorial problem solving, machine learning or AI in general depends on tuned hyperparameter configurations. Automated methods have been proposed to alleviate users from the tedious and error-prone task of manually searching for performance-optimized configurations across a set of problem instances. However there is still a lot of untapped potential through adjusting an algorithm's hyperparameters online since different hyperparameters are potentially optimal at different stages of the algorithm. We formulate the problem of adjusting an algorithm's hyperparameters for a given instance on the fly as a contextual MDP, making reinforcement learning (RL) the prime candidate to solve the resulting algorithm control problem in a data-driven way. Furthermore, inspired by applications of algorithm configuration, we introduce new white-box benchmarks suitable to study algorithm control. We show that on short sequences, algorithm configuration is a valid choice, but that with increasing sequence length a black-box view on the problem quickly becomes infeasible and RL performs better.",0
"As machine learning models gain popularity across numerous domains, there has been increasing attention on ensuring their trustworthiness and reliability. One critical aspect that contributes to these concerns is the black box nature of many algorithms, which makes it challenging to assess how they make decisions, evaluate their performance, and mitigate bias. Hence, efforts have focused on developing techniques for interpreting and explaining model predictions to enhance transparency and accountability. In parallel, benchmark datasets have played a crucial role in advancing the state-of-the-art by providing standardized evaluation measures for comparing different approaches. However, traditional benchmarks often rely on metrics suited for optimization rather than interpretability, thus falling short in promoting explainability research. This work aims to address this gap by introducing white-box benchmarks tailored towards algorithm control, providing more meaningful evaluation criteria for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on five well-known XAI benchmarks and showcase the advantages of utilizing our proposed framework.

"Efficiently scheduling data processing jobs on distributed compute clusters requires complex algorithms. Current systems, however, use simple generalized heuristics and ignore workload characteristics, since developing and tuning a scheduling policy for each workload is infeasible. In this paper, we show that modern machine learning techniques can generate highly-efficient policies automatically. Decima uses reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks to learn workload-specific scheduling algorithms without any human instruction beyond a high-level objective such as minimizing average job completion time. Off-the-shelf RL techniques, however, cannot handle the complexity and scale of the scheduling problem. To build Decima, we had to develop new representations for jobs' dependency graphs, design scalable RL models, and invent RL training methods for dealing with continuous stochastic job arrivals. Our prototype integration with Spark on a 25-node cluster shows that Decima improves the average job completion time over hand-tuned scheduling heuristics by at least 21%, achieving up to 2x improvement during periods of high cluster load.",0

"A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular model for reinforcement learning. However, its commonly used assumption of stationary dynamics and rewards is too stringent and fails to hold in adversarial, nonstationary, or multi-agent problems. We study an episodic setting where the parameters of an MDP can differ across episodes. We learn a reliable policy of this potentially adversarial MDP by developing an Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (ARL) algorithm that reduces our MDP to a sequence of \emph{adversarial} bandit problems. ARL achieves $O(\sqrt{SATH^3})$ regret, which is optimal with respect to $S$, $A$, and $T$, and its dependence on $H$ is the best (even for the usual stationary MDP) among existing model-free methods.",0

Our approach builds on recent advances in policy optimization under uncertainty, using techniques from reinforcement learning to learn a policy that can effectively handle these challenges. In particular, we use a model-based approximation of the dynamics to guide exploration, balancing the need to gather information about the changing environment with the risk of falling prey to the adversary's tactics. Our method yields promising results in several experiments across different problem domains, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world scenarios with strategic opponents. Overall, this work represents an important step towards developing robust algorithms for artificial intelligence systems operating in complex, dynamic environments.",1
"Reinforcement learning has become one of the best approach to train a computer game emulator capable of human level performance. In a reinforcement learning approach, an optimal value function is learned across a set of actions, or decisions, that leads to a set of states giving different rewards, with the objective to maximize the overall reward. A policy assigns to each state-action pairs an expected return. We call an optimal policy a policy for which the value function is optimal. QLBS, Q-Learner in the Black-Scholes(-Merton) Worlds, applies the reinforcement learning concepts, and noticeably, the popular Q-learning algorithm, to the financial stochastic model of Black, Scholes and Merton. It is, however, specifically optimized for the geometric Brownian motion and the vanilla options. Its range of application is, therefore, limited to vanilla option pricing within financial markets. We propose MQLV, Modified Q-Learner for the Vasicek model, a new reinforcement learning approach that determines the optimal policy of money management based on the aggregated financial transactions of the clients. It unlocks new frontiers to establish personalized credit card limits or to fulfill bank loan applications, targeting the retail banking industry. MQLV extends the simulation to mean reverting stochastic diffusion processes and it uses a digital function, a Heaviside step function expressed in its discrete form, to estimate the probability of a future event such as a payment default. In our experiments, we first show the similarities between a set of historical financial transactions and Vasicek generated transactions and, then, we underline the potential of MQLV on generated Monte Carlo simulations.

"This research presents a novel approach to retail banking using MQLV (Multi-Quantile Learning Value), which optimizes money management policies through Q-learning. In traditional retail banking, managing cash flow and credit risk is crucial for financial institutions to ensure stability and profitability. However, existing methods often rely on heuristics and statistical models that may not fully capture market conditions and customer behavior.  MQLV addresses these limitations by incorporating multi-quantiles into the learning process, allowing banks to better manage risks across different levels of uncertainty. Specifically, our model uses reinforcement learning algorithms to maximize returns while minimizing potential losses based on customer behavior patterns. We demonstrate how MQLV can improve decision making in retail banking scenarios such as loan approvals, interest rate setting, and liquidity management.  Experimental results show that MQLV significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both financial metrics and operational efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive policy design in modern retail banking and illustrate the potential benefits of leveraging machine learning techniques for enhanced decision support systems. Overall, we believe that MQLV provides valuable insights into optimal money management practices in the retail banking industry.",1
"To make efficient use of limited spectral resources, we in this work propose a deep actor-critic reinforcement learning based framework for dynamic multichannel access. We consider both a single-user case and a scenario in which multiple users attempt to access channels simultaneously. We employ the proposed framework as a single agent in the single-user case, and extend it to a decentralized multi-agent framework in the multi-user scenario. In both cases, we develop algorithms for the actor-critic deep reinforcement learning and evaluate the proposed learning policies via experiments and numerical results. In the single-user model, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed channel access policy and the framework's tolerance against uncertainty, we explore different channel switching patterns and different switching probabilities. In the case of multiple users, we analyze the probabilities of each user accessing channels with favorable channel conditions and the probability of collision. We also address a time-varying environment to identify the adaptive ability of the proposed framework. Additionally, we provide comparisons (in terms of both the average reward and time efficiency) between the proposed actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework, Deep-Q network (DQN) based approach, random access, and the optimal policy when the channel dynamics are known.",0
"This paper presents a novel deep actor critic reinforcement learning framework for dynamic multichannel access problems. The proposed method combines a dueling dual network architecture for state representation and policy evaluation respectively, with a proximal policy optimization algorithm. Through extensive simulations on wireless communication networks, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods such as Q-learning and SARSA, in terms of both speed and stability of convergence. Our results showcase the effectiveness of using model-free RL algorithms in solving complex problems in which only partial observability of states exists, and where exploration strategies need to take into account the real cost of making mistakes. Furthermore, we provide insights into designing reward functions that can effectively shape the agent behavior towards desirable solutions. Overall, our work shows promise in enabling researchers and practitioners alike to tackle more challenging tasks involving sequential decision making under uncertainty, particularly those requiring multiagent collaboration.",1
"Transfer learning methods for reinforcement learning (RL) domains facilitate the acquisition of new skills using previously acquired knowledge. The vast majority of existing approaches assume that the agents have the same design, e.g. same shape and action spaces. In this paper we address the problem of transferring previously acquired skills amongst morphologically different agents (MDAs). For instance, assuming that a bipedal agent has been trained to move forward, could this skill be transferred on to a one-leg hopper so as to make its training process for the same task more sample efficient? We frame this problem as one of subspace learning whereby we aim to infer latent factors representing the control mechanism that is common between MDAs. We propose a novel paired variational encoder-decoder model, PVED, that disentangles the control of MDAs into shared and agent-specific factors. The shared factors are then leveraged for skill transfer using RL. Theoretically, we derive a theorem indicating how the performance of PVED depends on the shared factors and agent morphologies. Experimentally, PVED has been extensively validated on four MuJoCo environments. We demonstrate its performance compared to a state-of-the-art approach and several ablation cases, visualize and interpret the hidden factors, and identify avenues for future improvements.",0
"Increasingly, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used in artificial intelligence applications that require interaction with realistic physical environments, such as robotics and autonomous driving systems. Since these environments contain multiple agents, which can differ from one another in terms of their sensing capabilities and actuation limitations, morphological heterogeneity becomes an important concern. Current DRL algorithms, however, cannot guarantee successful policy transfer across different agent types without explicit modifications to the algorithm design. This study proposes a new method for skill transfer in DRL models trained in homogeneous settings to work effectively on multiple tasks and robots, thus promoting efficiency and ease of use. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using simulations and experiments on a real mobile manipulator platform. Our results show improved generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in various scenarios involving varying sensor configurations and payload sizes. Overall, we believe that our proposed technique offers researchers and practitioners a versatile toolbox to enhance adaptability of DRL algorithms in complex real-world situations where various agents may need to collaborate seamlessly.",1
"Over the recent years, there has been an explosion of studies on autonomous vehicles. Many collected large amount of data from human drivers. However, compared to the tedious data collection approach, building a virtual simulation of traffic makes the autonomous vehicle research more flexible, time-saving, and scalable. Our work features a 3D simulation that takes in real time position information parsed from street cameras. The simulation can easily switch between a global bird view of the traffic and a local perspective of a car. It can also filter out certain objects in its customized camera, creating various channels for objects of different categories. This provides alternative supervised or unsupervised ways to train deep neural networks. Another advantage of the 3D simulation is its conformation to physical laws. Its naturalness to accelerate and collide prepares the system for potential deep reinforcement learning needs.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive simulation platform designed to test autonomous vehicles in complex urban environments with high traffic flow. By utilizing the widely known game engine, Unity, we created photorealistic scenarios which incorporate real world data from actual cities. Our methodology relies on a combination of manual level design along with procedural generation techniques that result in randomization and variation within each scenario. We developed two different models; one was trained using supervised learning on real world trajectories extracted from taxi traces and labeled ground truth data, another model uses Imitation Learning by observing real driver’s behavior. Both methods were implemented into our simulation framework and tested rigorously. Overall results indicate significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional rule based systems, demonstrating potential for widespread adoption of self driving cars in the near future.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popularly used for analyzing non-Euclidean data such as social network data and biological data. Despite their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks, GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.",0
"Increasingly, artificial intelligence researchers have turned to neural architecture search (NAS) as a means of optimizing machine learning models automatically. While there has been significant progress made using gradient-based methods for NAS on image classification problems, fewer advances have been seen in NAS for graph data structures such as knowledge graphs. This study presents GraphNAS, a novel method for automating the search of graph neural architectures using reinforcement learning (RL). Our approach uses RL agents which interact with an environment that simulates different search spaces over different tasks such as link prediction or node classification. We evaluate our framework against both random search baselines and state-of-the-art hand-engineered architectures on multiple datasets with promising results. Furthermore, we show how our learned architectures perform well across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating their generality. Finally, we provide analysis into the characteristics of successful architectures found by GraphNAS, providing insights into future directions for NAS approaches in this area. Overall, these findings demonstrate that RL can effectively guide the search for graph neural network architectures without explicit supervision, showing great promise for applying NAS to more complex domains beyond images.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) demonstrates excellent performance on tasks that can be solved by trained policy. It plays a dominant role among cutting-edge machine learning approaches using multi-layer Neural networks (NNs). At the same time, Deep RL suffers from high sensitivity to noisy, incomplete, and misleading input data. Following biological intuition, we involve Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to address some deficiencies of deep RL solutions. Previous studies in image classification domain demonstrated that standard NNs (with ReLU nonlinearity) trained using supervised learning can be converted to SNNs with negligible deterioration in performance. In this paper, we extend those conversion results to the domain of Q-Learning NNs trained using RL. We provide a proof of principle of the conversion of standard NN to SNN. In addition, we show that the SNN has improved robustness to occlusion in the input image. Finally, we introduce results with converting full-scale Deep Q-network to SNN, paving the way for future research to robust Deep RL applications.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven highly effective at solving difficult tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and even game playing. However, these models often require large amounts of computational resources and suffer from low energy efficiency. Spiking neuronal networks (SNNs), on the other hand, are bio-inspired models that simulate the behavior of neurons more faithfully than traditional artificial neural nets, resulting in significant gains in terms of both computation and power consumption. This study presents a novel methodology for converting reinforcement learning agents based on DNNs into their SNN counterparts while preserving task performance and improving policy robustness against adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to popular benchmark environments like ATARI games. Our results show improved stability across environments while maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models trained directly on ATARI games using DNN architectures. The proposed method provides evidence that reinforcement learning algorithms can benefit significantly from transferring to biologically inspired models, promising further progress towards creating intelligent systems optimized for real-world deployment scenarios involving limited computing capabilities.",1
"Most e-commerce product feeds provide blended results of advertised products and recommended products to consumers. The underlying advertising and recommendation platforms share similar if not exactly the same set of candidate products. Consumers' behaviors on the advertised results constitute part of the recommendation model's training data and therefore can influence the recommended results. We refer to this process as Leverage. Considering this mechanism, we propose a novel perspective that advertisers can strategically bid through the advertising platform to optimize their recommended organic traffic. By analyzing the real-world data, we first explain the principles of Leverage mechanism, i.e., the dynamic models of Leverage. Then we introduce a novel Leverage optimization problem and formulate it with a Markov Decision Process. To deal with the sample complexity challenge in model-free reinforcement learning, we propose a novel Hybrid Training Leverage Bidding (HTLB) algorithm which combines the real-world samples and the emulator-generated samples to boost the learning speed and stability. Our offline experiments as well as the results from the online deployment demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.",0
"Title: Optimizing Organic Search Performance Through Enhanced Commercial Listing Formatting.  Abstract: This study examines the impact of enhanced e-commerce product feed formatting on organic search traffic acquisition among top performing online retailers. By analyzing millions of commercial listings across thousands of domains over time, we identify how specific product feed characteristics drive increases in organic visibility, conversion rates, and overall revenue. Our findings suggest that by adopting enhanced product feed formats such as high-quality images, descriptive titles, accurate pricing, comprehensive descriptions, and consistent categorization, e-retailers can significantly boost their natural search rankings, attract more organic traffic, enhance customer engagement, and increase sales returns. We demonstrate through controlled experiments and statistical analyses that minor modifications in listing design can lead to substantial improvements in both short-term exposure metrics and long-term search engine optimization success.

"This paper proposes a cascading failure mitigation strategy based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) method. Firstly, the principles of RL are introduced. Then, the Multi-Stage Cascading Failure (MSCF) problem is presented and its challenges are investigated. The problem is then tackled by the RL based on DC-OPF (Optimal Power Flow). Designs of the key elements of the RL framework (rewards, states, etc.) are also discussed in detail. Experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system by both shallow and deep neural networks demonstrate promising results in terms of reduced system collapse rates.",0
"In recent years, multi-stage cascading failures have become increasingly prevalent in complex systems such as power grids and financial markets. These failures can propagate rapidly through multiple stages, leading to severe consequences that are difficult to predict and control. As such, developing effective methods for mitigation is essential for ensuring system resilience. This paper proposes a novel approach based on reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges posed by multi-stage cascading failure scenarios. We first define a formal framework for modeling these failures within RL settings, enabling us to identify key factors that contribute to their development and progression. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate how our proposed methodology allows agents to learn optimal strategies for minimizing the impacts of initial failures and reducing the likelihood of subsequent cascade events. Our results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating advanced machine learning techniques into risk management practices for real-world systems at risk from multi-stage cascading failures. By enabling more informed decision making under uncertainty, this work has important implications for safeguarding critical infrastructure sectors worldwide. Overall, our research contributes new insights and tools towards improving the robustness of interconnected networks against cascading disturbances and promoting systemic stability.",1

VUSFA, our final architecture, is a straightforward approach that can be implemented using our open source repository. Our approach is generalizable, showed greater stability in training, and outperformed recent approaches in terms of transfer learning ability.",0
"This will help ensure that your content reflects real academic practice where authors typically leave out paper details in abstracts. Also, using passive voice is acceptable here because you want to keep authorship neutral! So no ""We"" or first person singular.   VNNS (Visual Navigation Networks) have become increasingly popular in robotics and drones, especially those used for target driven navigation tasks like delivery systems. Recent studies show promising results from using deep reinforcement learning to train these models, but training has been limited by sample inefficiency due to slow convergence rates found in previous methods such as SAC. In this work we seek to address these limitations through our new model Variational Universal Successor Feature Approximator (VUSFA). Our method modifies RL algorithms so they can use learned successor features directly from previously trained policy distribution as initialization for the next iteration. We prove theoretically and experimentally that utilizing learned successor features drastically improves both accuracy and sample efficiency compared to vanilla SAC and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) which were considered state-of-the art before in the field of VisioanlNavigation. Our approach overcomes issues like high variance in rewards making it possible to converge faster than alternative methods while also offering better final performance overall. Finally, experiments on commonly used datasets demonstrate that our technique provides major improvements across all metrics with significant effect size where applicable and statistical significance achieved. Overall our findings contribute positively towards achieving more advanced capabilities in the future for robotic applications ranging from manufacturing to healthcare.

"This paper studies a recent proposal to use randomized value functions to drive exploration in reinforcement learning. These randomized value functions are generated by injecting random noise into the training data, making the approach compatible with many popular methods for estimating parameterized value functions. By providing a worst-case regret bound for tabular finite-horizon Markov decision processes, we show that planning with respect to these randomized value functions can induce provably efficient exploration.",0
"In this work, we develop new worst-case regret bounds for reinforcement learning algorithms that use randomized value functions as exploration strategies. We show how these bounds can be used to improve upon existing results and provide tighter performance guarantees. Our main contributions include: (i) establishing new regret bounds that depend on the problem parameters rather than time steps; (ii) developing novel exploration schemes based on concentration inequalities and geometric techniques; and (iii) demonstrating empirically the effectiveness of our methods across a range of benchmark tasks. Overall, our findings offer insights into the design of effective exploration policies for RL problems and contribute towards achieving higher levels of autonomy in artificial agents.",1
"Recent advances in both machine learning and Internet-of-Things have attracted attention to automatic Activity Recognition, where users wear a device with sensors and their outputs are mapped to a predefined set of activities. However, few studies have considered the balance between wearable power consumption and activity recognition accuracy. This is particularly important when part of the computational load happens on the wearable device. In this paper, we present a new methodology to perform feature selection on the device based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to find the optimum balance between power consumption and accuracy. To accelerate the learning speed, we extend the RL algorithm to address multiple sources of feedback, and use them to tailor the policy in conjunction with estimating the feedback accuracy. We evaluated our system on the SPHERE challenge dataset, a publicly available research dataset. The results show that our proposed method achieves a good trade-off between wearable power consumption and activity recognition accuracy.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to feature selection for activity recognition using reinforcement learning with multiple feedback. Traditional approaches to feature selection often rely on heuristics or hand-engineered features which may not always capture all relevant information for a given task. In contrast, our method uses reinforcement learning to automatically select the most informative features from a large pool of possibilities.  The key insight of our work is that different features may be more or less important at different stages of the activity recognition process, and these preferences can change based on the available contextual information. To account for this variability, we use multiple sources of feedback to train our reinforcement learner. These include both explicit labels indicating whether a particular action was performed correctly as well as implicit signals such as user engagement or system performance metrics.  Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to traditional feature engineering techniques. Across a range of real-world datasets, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing the number of features required for effective activity recognition. Overall, our approach provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling complex activity recognition problems in diverse domains, including healthcare, entertainment, and social media analytics.",1
"This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) under malicious falsification on cost signals and introduces a quantitative framework of attack models to understand the vulnerabilities of RL. Focusing on $Q$-learning, we show that $Q$-learning algorithms converge under stealthy attacks and bounded falsifications on cost signals. We characterize the relation between the falsified cost and the $Q$-factors as well as the policy learned by the learning agent which provides fundamental limits for feasible offensive and defensive moves. We propose a robust region in terms of the cost within which the adversary can never achieve the targeted policy. We provide conditions on the falsified cost which can mislead the agent to learn an adversary's favored policy. A numerical case study of water reservoir control is provided to show the potential hazards of RL in learning-based control systems and corroborate the results.",0

And by that point, I would like to imagine I can share many, many things from all aspects of life - including but not limited to scientific discoveries! 😃 If our children had access to some version of advanced technology, how might their experience differ? Could they create something far greater than we have achieved? Might it even lead us to explore outer space together as one family? With advances in robotics we may send robots into space to collect data, build structures, and potentially assist future astronauts; could these robots (or other artificial intelligences) communicate back to Earth in human-like speech forms? Would humans prefer virtual reality versions of themselves to travel through space instead? How soon before our descendants are travelling across interstellar distances or living permanently within orbiting habitats built in zero gravity? What stories might they tell about what lies beyond our planet? Who knows where their curiosity takes them; maybe by then they will be better at listening to animals to gain insights into mysterious biological systems. Or perhaps they have cracked even more puzzling questions such as dark energy by which the universe itself accelerates faster over time...

"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) infers a reward function from demonstrations, allowing for policy improvement and generalization. However, despite much recent interest in IRL, little work has been done to understand the minimum set of demonstrations needed to teach a specific sequential decision-making task. We formalize the problem of finding maximally informative demonstrations for IRL as a machine teaching problem where the goal is to find the minimum number of demonstrations needed to specify the reward equivalence class of the demonstrator. We extend previous work on algorithmic teaching for sequential decision-making tasks by showing a reduction to the set cover problem which enables an efficient approximation algorithm for determining the set of maximally-informative demonstrations. We apply our proposed machine teaching algorithm to two novel applications: providing a lower bound on the number of queries needed to learn a policy using active IRL and developing a novel IRL algorithm that can learn more efficiently from informative demonstrations than a standard IRL approach.",0
"In recent years, machine teaching has emerged as a powerful tool for training artificial intelligence (AI) agents that can learn from human feedback.

This paper presents several new algorithms for IRL based on machine teaching principles. We evaluate these methods using both simulated robotics tasks and real-world examples drawn from domains such as computer vision and games. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

"Counterfactual thinking describes a psychological phenomenon that people re-infer the possible results with different solutions about things that have already happened. It helps people to gain more experience from mistakes and thus to perform better in similar future tasks. This paper investigates the counterfactual thinking for agents to find optimal decision-making strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments. In particular, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model with a structure which mimics the human-psychological counterfactual thinking process to improve the competitive abilities for agents. To this end, our model generates several possible actions (intent actions) with a parallel policy structure and estimates the rewards and regrets for these intent actions based on its current understanding of the environment. Our model incorporates a scenario-based framework to link the estimated regrets with its inner policies. During the iterations, our model updates the parallel policies and the corresponding scenario-based regrets for agents simultaneously. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on two different environments with real-world applications. Experimental results show that counterfactual thinking can actually benefit the agents to obtain more accumulative rewards from the environments with fair information by comparing to their opponents while keeping high performing efficiency.",0
"In this article we present two deep reinforcement learning algorithms that employ competitive multi-agent training: counterfactually guided policy search (CGPS) and the Q-learning-based Counterfactual Multi Agent Policy Optimization algorithm (CMAPO). These methods rely on the concept of ""counterfactuals,"" which involve imagining alternative scenarios where different choices may have led to better outcomes than the actual choice made by an agent at a given decision point in time. By using counterfactuals as part of their training process, these agents can effectively learn policies that maximize reward not only based on historical data but also through hypothetical simulations of what could have happened if different actions had been taken. We evaluate both CGPS and CMAPO against several benchmarks and show they achieve significantly better results across multiple domains, including single-agent tasks such as Atari games and more complex multi-agent environments like social dilemmas involving cooperation and competition between multiple parties. Our work demonstrates the potential benefits of integrating counterfactual thinking into reinforcement learning models, leading to improved performance and greater adaptability to changing circumstances and competitive conditions.",1

"Multi-agent systems have a wide range of applications in cooperative and competitive tasks. As the number of agents increases, nonstationarity gets more serious in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which brings great difficulties to the learning process. Besides, current mainstream algorithms configure each agent an independent network,so that the memory usage increases linearly with the number of agents which greatly slows down the interaction with the environment. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), this paper proposes an iterative update method (IU) to stabilize the nonstationary environment. Further, we add first-person perspective and represent all agents by only one network which can change agents' policies from sequential compute to batch compute. Similar to continual lifelong learning, we realize the iterative update method in this unified representative network (IUUR). In this method, iterative update can greatly alleviate the nonstationarity of the environment, unified representation can speed up the interaction with environment and avoid the linear growth of memory usage. Besides, this method does not bother decentralized execution and distributed deployment. Experiments show that compared with MADDPG, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance and saves wall-clock time by a large margin especially with more agents.",0
"""In recent years, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks that involve multiple agents interacting with each other in dynamic environments. However, designing effective MARL algorithms remains a challenging task due to issues such as non-stationarity, partial observability, credit assignment problems, and scalability. In this paper, we propose two key contributions: iterative update mechanism and unified representation scheme. The former tackles the issue of non-stationarity by adaptively updating agents’ parameters based on their local experience replay buffers. This ensures that the learned policies gradually converge towards equilibrium strategies even in fast-changing scenarios. The latter addresses the partial observability problem by using graph attention networks, which allow agents to share their hidden states across different layers. Furthermore, our algorithm uses the VDN (value difference network), GAIL (generative adversarial imitation learning) or QMIX (quasi-mixing) value functions, which enables us to achieve better stability and performance than traditional centralized training methods. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms across various MAS benchmarks.""",1
"Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) allows data-efficient learning which is required in real world applications such as robotics. However, despite the impressive data-efficiency, MBRL does not achieve the final performance of state-of-the-art Model-free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) methods. We leverage the strengths of both realms and propose an approach that obtains high performance with a small amount of data. In particular, we combine MFRL and Model Predictive Control (MPC). While MFRL's strength in exploration allows us to train a better forward dynamics model for MPC, MPC improves the performance of the MFRL policy by sampling-based planning. The experimental results in standard continuous control benchmarks show that our approach can achieve MFRL`s level of performance while being as data-efficient as MBRL.",0
"Abstract: Recently published data indicates that model-free deep reinforcement learning has achieved some of the most significant breakthroughs since AlphaGo [2]. However, researchers have found that there is still uncharted territory for improving these systems even further—which led to our latest study on how modern agents can learn from models using lookahead techniques (i.e., planning) during learning through trial and error [1]. We evaluate our method’s performance against standard DDPG baselines on three classic continuous control domains from OpenAI Gym [7], observing clear improvements over SAC as well as DDPG(0/1). Our work demonstrates that integrating careful domain knowledge into model-free RL methods can achieve previously impossible results. While we only considered simple random search models here, future work could extend our method to more advanced prior distributions or incorporate model selection [9] to allow for better integration with human expertise [4]. Finally, although not specifically related to lookahead RL, other papers suggest several other ways to improve model-free RL agents beyond basic random exploration [6][8]; however, the authors believe their work provides a new angle worth exploring given recent trends towards model-based planning under uncertainty [3]. Overall, they hope readers find this unique approach to enhancing model-free deep RL interesting and consider applications outside academia within industrial manufacturing sectors where robustness under volatile conditions may be critical (e.g., supply chains for COVID-19 vaccines globally).",1
"Generating image descriptions in different languages is essential to satisfy users worldwide. However, it is prohibitively expensive to collect large-scale paired image-caption dataset for every target language which is critical for training descent image captioning models. Previous works tackle the unpaired cross-lingual image captioning problem through a pivot language, which is with the help of paired image-caption data in the pivot language and pivot-to-target machine translation models. However, such language-pivoted approach suffers from inaccuracy brought by the pivot-to-target translation, including disfluency and visual irrelevancy errors. In this paper, we propose to generate cross-lingual image captions with self-supervised rewards in the reinforcement learning framework to alleviate these two types of errors. We employ self-supervision from mono-lingual corpus in the target language to provide fluency reward, and propose a multi-level visual semantic matching model to provide both sentence-level and concept-level visual relevancy rewards. We conduct extensive experiments for unpaired cross-lingual image captioning in both English and Chinese respectively on two widely used image caption corpora. The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to generating image captions in one language based on images paired with captions in another language using self-supervised learning. We propose a model that generates captions for unpaired cross-lingual images by predicting missing descriptions from incomplete captions. Our method uses reinforcement learning techniques to optimize a reward function that measures similarity between predicted and ground truth captions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cross-lingual image caption generation, achieving significant improvements in BLEU score and visual coherence metrics. Additionally, we show that our model effectively learns cross-linguistic representations that can transfer knowledge across languages without explicit supervision. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards enabling computers to automatically generate natural language descriptions of complex scenes in multiple languages using only raw image data as input.",1

Our Curious Object-Based seaRch Agent (COBRA) uses task-free intrinsically motivated exploration and unsupervised learning to build object-based models of its environment and action space. Subsequently, it can learn a variety of tasks through model-based search in very few steps and excel on structured hold-out tests of policy robustness.",0
"One promising approach to improve exploration efficiency in model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods is curiosity-driven exploration that intrinsically encourages agents to visit states they have never been before [1]. However, simply adding intrinsic motivation cannot guarantee efficient data collection over complex tasks due to limited observability and large state spaces. In practice, human expert knowledge can often provide priors on the features or representations critical for efficient exploration, which enables more informative curiosity measures [2, 3, 4] that take advantage of available side observations during interactive robotics training without explicit supervision. Yet current model-based deep RL algorithms still rely heavily on labeled experience replay buffers, which limits their scalability to high-dimensional image-based observation spaces even given expert guidance via demonstrations [5]. To achieve both data efficiency and generalization across diverse environments, we propose unifying intrinsic objectives into our semi-model based algorithm COBRA that learns to discover latent objects from raw sensory inputs, disambiguates ambiguous observations, and generates goal-directed policies conditioned on these discovered symbols. We theoretically analyze how these modules interact to reduce sample complexity relative to existing model-free and hybrid approaches while maintaining comparable performance. Extensive experiments show our method outperforms prior unsupervised models and competitive results in challenging benchmark domains such as Atari games and robot manipulation tasks by exploiting discovered structure for faster exploration and better use of expert guidance [6]. Our work offers new insights into achieving generalizable, self-supervised perception and",1
"Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a recently proposed task, where an agent is placed in a rich 3D environment and must act based solely on its egocentric input to answer a given question. The desired outcome is that the agent learns to combine capabilities such as scene understanding, navigation and language understanding in order to perform complex reasoning in the visual world. However, initial advancements combining standard vision and language methods with imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms have shown EQA might be too complex and challenging for these techniques. In order to investigate the feasibility of EQA-type tasks, we build the VideoNavQA dataset that contains pairs of questions and videos generated in the House3D environment. The goal of this dataset is to assess question-answering performance from nearly-ideal navigation paths, while considering a much more complete variety of questions than current instantiations of the EQA task. We investigate several models, adapted from popular VQA methods, on this new benchmark. This establishes an initial understanding of how well VQA-style methods can perform within this novel EQA paradigm.",0
"This paper introduces VideoNavQA, a new system that combines visual question answering (VQA) tasks with robot navigation tasks into a single integrated model. VQA involves predicting answers to questions about images and videos, while embodied QA requires agents to navigate through environments to find answers to questions. Our system addresses the problem of bridging these two areas by integrating both modalities in a unified framework. We present results on challenging benchmarks showing that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both domains. Our work demonstrates the potential benefits of combining visual and embodied reasoning to solve complex problems in artificial intelligence. Overall, VideoNavQA paves the way towards more capable and versatile agents that can effectively interact with their environment.",1
"Although significant progress has been made in the field of automatic image captioning, it is still a challenging task. Previous works normally pay much attention to improving the quality of the generated captions but ignore the diversity of captions. In this paper, we combine determinantal point process (DPP) and reinforcement learning (RL) and propose a novel reinforcing DPP (R-DPP) approach to generate a set of captions with high quality and diversity for an image. We show that R-DPP performs better on accuracy and diversity than using noise as a control signal (GANs, VAEs). Moreover, R-DPP is able to preserve the modes of the learned distribution. Hence, beam search algorithm can be applied to generate a single accurate caption, which performs better than other RL-based models.",0

"Recent developments in machine-learning algorithms have led to impressive performance increases in many traditional application scenarios of artificial intelligence research. In the area of deep reinforcement learning, deep learning functional architectures are combined with incremental learning schemes for sequential tasks that include interaction-based, but often delayed feedback. Despite their impressive successes, modern machine-learning approaches, including deep reinforcement learning, still perform weakly when compared to flexibly adaptive biological systems in certain naturally occurring scenarios. Such scenarios include transfers to environments different than the ones in which the training took place or environments that dynamically change, both of which are often mastered by biological systems through a capability that we here term ""fluid adaptivity"" to contrast it from the much slower adaptivity (""crystallized adaptivity"") of the prior learning from which the behavior emerged. In this article, we derive and discuss research strategies, based on analyzes of fluid adaptivity in biological systems and its neuronal modeling, that might aid in equipping future artificially intelligent systems with capabilities of fluid adaptivity more similar to those seen in some biologically intelligent systems. A key component of this research strategy is the dynamization of the problem space itself and the implementation of this dynamization by suitably designed flexibly interacting modules.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach to artificial intelligence, enabling agents to learn complex behaviors through trial and error by maximizing cumulative reward. However, DRL algorithms often suffer from limited adaptability, particularly in dynamic environments where tasks vary over time or require rapid adaptation to changing situations. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel framework for improving the flexibility of DRL agents by combining crystalline representations with fluid processing mechanisms inspired by biological systems. We demonstrate that hybrid agents equipped with both fixed and malleable knowledge structures outperform traditional DRL methods across a range of challenging benchmark tasks, including those requiring quick adaptability and handling of new concepts. Our findings provide insights into the design principles underlying adaptive cognitive systems and offer practical implications for advancing the performance of autonomous agents in real-world applications.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has learned to play many games well, but failed on others. To better characterize the modes and reasons of failure of deep reinforcement learners, we test the widely used Asynchronous Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm on four deceptive games, which are specially designed to provide challenges to game-playing agents. These games are implemented in the General Video Game AI framework, which allows us to compare the behavior of reinforcement learning-based agents with planning agents based on tree search. We find that several of these games reliably deceive deep reinforcement learners, and that the resulting behavior highlights the shortcomings of the learning algorithm. The particular ways in which agents fail differ from how planning-based agents fail, further illuminating the character of these algorithms. We propose an initial typology of deceptions which could help us better understand pitfalls and failure modes of (deep) reinforcement learning.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained popularity as a powerful approach to solving complex decision making problems across various domains. However, there remain significant open questions about the robustness and reliability of DRL algorithms in real-world settings, particularly when it comes to their susceptibility to exploitation by adversaries who might seek to manipulate the system for their own gain. This paper seeks to address these concerns by examining the potential vulnerabilities of DRL agents to strategic manipulation and deception by human players, focusing on scenarios where deceitful actions can lead to more favorable outcomes than truthful ones. We demonstrate through a set of experiments that even simple forms of deception can have a large impact on the performance of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, undermining their effectiveness and highlighting the importance of developing new methods to enhance agent resilience. Our findings contribute important insights into the challenges of building reliable intelligent systems capable of operating effectively in complex and dynamic environments characterized by uncertain and often adversarial intentions.",1
"Robotic systems are ever more capable of automation and fulfilment of complex tasks, particularly with reliance on recent advances in intelligent systems, deep learning and artificial intelligence. However, as robots and humans come closer in their interactions, the matter of interpretability, or explainability of robot decision-making processes for the human grows in importance. A successful interaction and collaboration will only take place through mutual understanding of underlying representations of the environment and the task at hand. This is currently a challenge in deep learning systems. We present a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning system, consisting of a low-level agent handling the large actions/states space of a robotic system efficiently, by following the directives of a high-level agent which is learning the high-level dynamics of the environment and task. This high-level agent forms a representation of the world and task at hand that is interpretable for a human operator. The method, which we call Dot-to-Dot, is tested on a MuJoCo-based model of the Fetch Robotics Manipulator, as well as a Shadow Hand, to test its performance. Results show efficient learning of complex actions/states spaces by the low-level agent, and an interpretable representation of the task and decision-making process learned by the high-level agent.",0
"This paper presents a new methodology for reinforcement learning in robotic manipulation tasks that is able to learn efficiently and effectively through hierarchical reasoning and explainability. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trial and error without any understanding of why certain actions lead to success or failure, our approach uses explicit knowledge representations such as semantic priors and goals to guide the learning process. We showcase how these representations can facilitate generalization across different environments by enabling robots to transfer learned skills from one task to another. In addition, we demonstrate the use of post-hoc explanation techniques to provide insight into the decisions made by the agent during execution. Our evaluation shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and performance, making our approach well suited for real-world applications where transparency and robustness are crucial.",1
"In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based mobility load balancing (MLB) algorithm along with a two-layer architecture to solve the large-scale load balancing problem for ultra-dense networks (UDNs). Our contribution is three-fold. First, this work proposes a two-layer architecture to solve the large-scale load balancing problem in a self-organized manner. The proposed architecture can alleviate the global traffic variations by dynamically grouping small cells into self-organized clusters according to their historical loads, and further adapt to local traffic variations through intra-cluster load balancing afterwards. Second, for the intra-cluster load balancing, this paper proposes an off-policy DRL-based MLB algorithm to autonomously learn the optimal MLB policy under an asynchronous parallel learning framework, without any prior knowledge assumed over the underlying UDN environments. Moreover, the algorithm enables joint exploration with multiple behavior policies, such that the traditional MLB methods can be used to guide the learning process thereby improving the learning efficiency and stability. Third, this work proposes an offline-evaluation based safeguard mechanism to ensure that the online system can always operate with the optimal and well-trained MLB policy, which not only stabilizes the online performance but also enables the exploration beyond current policies to make full use of machine learning in a safe way. Empirical results verify that the proposed framework outperforms the existing MLB methods in general UDN environments featured with irregular network topologies, coupled interferences, and random user movements, in terms of the load balancing performance.",0
"In ultra-dense networks (UDN), where massive numbers of wireless devices compete for scarce bandwidth resources, efficient load balancing is critical to optimize network performance and user experience. Conventional algorithms like round robin and proportional fairness have limitations in achieving optimal resource allocation in these highly dynamic environments. In this research, we propose using deep reinforcement learning techniques to develop a novel approach that can effectively balance loads and minimize congestion across UDN. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn the complex relationships among device characteristics, channel conditions, traffic patterns, and network conditions. By integrating exploration strategies like Boltzmann Exploration and Upper Confidence Bound into our framework, we ensure adaptability and flexibility in handling unpredictable changes in environment settings. Simulation results demonstrate significantly improved metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods under varied scenarios and showcase promising potential for real-world applications. This work opens up new possibilities for utilizing machine intelligence to enhance cellular capacity while offering better QoS guarantees.",1
"Many practical applications of reinforcement learning constrain agents to learn from a fixed batch of data which has already been gathered, without offering further possibility for data collection. In this paper, we demonstrate that due to errors introduced by extrapolation, standard off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN and DDPG, are incapable of learning with data uncorrelated to the distribution under the current policy, making them ineffective for this fixed batch setting. We introduce a novel class of off-policy algorithms, batch-constrained reinforcement learning, which restricts the action space in order to force the agent towards behaving close to on-policy with respect to a subset of the given data. We present the first continuous control deep reinforcement learning algorithm which can learn effectively from arbitrary, fixed batch data, and empirically demonstrate the quality of its behavior in several tasks.",0
"Title: ""Achieving Off-policy Deep Reinforcement Learning Without Exploration""  Abstract: Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to be effective for training agents that can perform well on complex tasks, but typically requires large amounts of exploratory interaction with the environment. This interactive process can be time-consuming and may result in suboptimal policies due to the need to learn from trial and error. In this work, we propose a method for achieving off-policy RL without the use of explicit exploration. We introduce a novel approach based on a meta-learning algorithm that allows the agent to learn from experiences collected by other agents, rather than relying exclusively on self-exploration. Our approach utilizes proximal policy optimization algorithms and demonstrates how they can effectively learn policies using data obtained from multiple sources. The results of our experiments show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance to traditional off-policy methods while significantly reducing the amount of required exploration.",1
"Policy gradient methods have demonstrated success in reinforcement learning tasks that have high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. However, policy gradient methods are also notoriously sample inefficient. This can be attributed, at least in part, to the high variance in estimating the gradient of the task objective with Monte Carlo methods. Previous research has endeavored to contend with this problem by studying control variates (CVs) that can reduce the variance of estimates without introducing bias, including the early use of baselines, state dependent CVs, and the more recent state-action dependent CVs. In this work, we analyze the properties and drawbacks of previous CV techniques and, surprisingly, we find that these works have overlooked an important fact that Monte Carlo gradient estimates are generated by trajectories of states and actions. We show that ignoring the correlation across the trajectories can result in suboptimal variance reduction, and we propose a simple fix: a class of ""trajectory-wise"" CVs, that can further drive down the variance. We show that constructing trajectory-wise CVs can be done recursively and requires only learning state-action value functions like the previous CVs for policy gradient. We further prove that the proposed trajectory-wise CVs are optimal for variance reduction under reasonable assumptions.",0
"Trajectory-wise control variates have been proposed as a method for variance reduction in reinforcement learning algorithms that use policy gradients. These methods use control variates to estimate the gradient of the expected return w.r.t. parameters and reduce the variance of these estimates, thereby accelerating convergence speed in large state spaces. In this paper we propose a novel application of trajectory-wise control variates specifically designed for policy gradient methods. Our approach uses two separate types of estimates; one based on state visitation probability and another using shaped rewards based on the parameterized policy. We show that both approaches lead to significant improvements over standard policy gradients and that their combination yields even better results. In addition, our work provides insights into how specific choices regarding the shaping function impact performance and highlights the advantages of adapting these functions during training. Ultimately, our contributions provide important new tools for addressing challenges associated with high dimensional continuous action space problems such as those found in robotics applications where sampling efficiency is crucial for efficient model learning from real-world interactions.",1
"In artificial intelligence, we often specify tasks through a reward function. While this works well in some settings, many tasks are hard to specify this way. In deep reinforcement learning, for example, directly specifying a reward as a function of a high-dimensional observation is challenging. Instead, we present an interface for specifying tasks interactively using demonstrations. Our approach defines a set of increasingly complex policies. The interface allows the user to switch between these policies at fixed intervals to generate demonstrations of novel, more complex, tasks. We train new policies based on these demonstrations and repeat the process. We present a case study of our approach in the Lunar Lander domain, and show that this simple approach can quickly learn a successful landing policy and outperforms an existing comparison-based deep RL method.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), one area that has seen significant progress over the past few decades is agent design. Agents are autonomous entities capable of acting on behalf of their users, making them highly valuable tools for automating complex tasks in domains such as robotics, finance, healthcare, and education. However, building effective agents remains challenging due to several factors: the need to consider a wide range of requirements related to performance, flexibility, adaptability, security, privacy, usability, scalability, among others; the inherent complexity introduced by interactions across multiple levels, from low-level perception and control to high-level decision making and learning; and the growing importance of human-agent interaction, which requires novel approaches to support transparency, interpretability, trustworthiness, and personalization. This paper presents an extensible interactive interface for agent design that addresses these issues while providing researchers with more efficient ways to develop, evaluate, and refine intelligent systems. By integrating state-of-the-art technologies and concepts, our framework empowers non-experts to create tailored solutions based on individual needs, leveraging advances in human computer interaction, knowledge representation, multi-agent systems, machine learning, and cognitive science. Through extensive experiments with diverse user groups and real use cases, we demonstrate how the proposed approach facilitates rapid prototyping and iterative improvement cycles towards better agent experiences at reduced costs and improved scientific validation. Our work paves the way for democratizing access to advanced AI methods, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and improving society’s readi",1
"We consider the problem of fine-grained classification on an edge camera device that has limited power. The edge device must sparingly interact with the cloud to minimize communication bits to conserve power, and the cloud upon receiving the edge inputs returns a classification label. To deal with fine-grained classification, we adopt the perspective of sequential fixation with a foveated field-of-view to model cloud-edge interactions. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based foveation model, DRIFT, that sequentially generates and recognizes mixed-acuity images.Training of DRIFT requires only image-level category labels and encourages fixations to contain task-relevant information, while maintaining data efficiency. Specifically, wetrain a foveation actor network with a novel Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient by Conditioned Critic and Coaching (DDPGC3) algorithm. In addition, we propose to shape the reward to provide informative feedback after each fixation to better guide RL training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DRIFT on this task by evaluating on five fine-grained classification benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with over 3X reduction in transmitted pixels.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to fine-grained recognition for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that takes into account cost considerations. We propose using sequential fixation, which involves dividing attention towards objects during visual exploration into discrete fixations, to improve accuracy while reducing computational costs. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to model the relationship between image features and object attributes at different scales and levels of detail. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over existing methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, making it well suited for resource-constrained environments.",1
"Automatic data abstraction is an important capability for both benchmarking machine intelligence and supporting summarization applications. In the former one asks whether a machine can `understand' enough about the meaning of input data to produce a meaningful but more compact abstraction. In the latter this capability is exploited for saving space or human time by summarizing the essence of input data. In this paper we study a general reinforcement learning based framework for learning to abstract sequential data in a goal-driven way. The ability to define different abstraction goals uniquely allows different aspects of the input data to be preserved according to the ultimate purpose of the abstraction. Our reinforcement learning objective does not require human-defined examples of ideal abstraction. Importantly our model processes the input sequence holistically without being constrained by the original input order. Our framework is also domain agnostic -- we demonstrate applications to sketch, video and text data and achieve promising results in all domains.",0
"Title: Goal-Driven Sequential Data Abstraction  Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for data abstraction that takes a goal-driven approach, allowing developers to specify their desired outcomes and have the system automatically generate optimized code. We propose using sequential decision making techniques from reinforcement learning (RL) to model and solve problems, enabling intelligent agents to make decisions based on specified goals. By incorporating deep learning into our algorithmic process, we can learn the mapping from high-level specifications to low-level implementations with minimal human intervention. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods of data abstraction and highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Overall, this work represents an important step forward towards more efficient software development through artificial intelligence-assisted programming.",1
"Continuous reinforcement learning such as DDPG and A3C are widely used in robot control and autonomous driving. However, both methods have theoretical weaknesses. While DDPG cannot control noises in the control process, A3C does not satisfy the continuity conditions under the Gaussian policy. To address these concerns, we propose a new continues reinforcement learning method based on stochastic differential equations and we call it Incremental Reinforcement Learning (IRL). This method not only guarantees the continuity of actions within any time interval, but controls the variance of actions in the training process. In addition, our method does not assume Markov control in agents' action control and allows agents to predict scene changes for action selection. With our method, agents no longer passively adapt to the environment. Instead, they positively interact with the environment for maximum rewards.",0
"In this research paper, we propose a new framework for continuous reinforcement learning based on stochastic differential equation (SDE) methods. Our approach, called incremental reinforcement learning (IRL), addresses some limitations of existing SDE-based approaches by allowing for more flexibility in the modeling of both the state transition process and the reward function. We show how IRL can effectively learn optimal policies in complex environments, even in the presence of noisy observations and delayed rewards. Furthermore, our method allows for easy incorporation of prior knowledge into the learning algorithm, which can significantly improve performance. Through extensive simulations and experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IRL compared to several benchmark algorithms, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for real-world applications in control and decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly applied to practical problems with an enormous number of states, where function approximation must be deployed to approximate either the value function or the policy. The introduction of function approximation raises a fundamental set of challenges involving computational and statistical efficiency, especially given the need to manage the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. As a result, a core RL question remains open: how can we design provably efficient RL algorithms that incorporate function approximation? This question persists even in a basic setting with linear dynamics and linear rewards, for which only linear function approximation is needed.   This paper presents the first provable RL algorithm with both polynomial runtime and polynomial sample complexity in this linear setting, without requiring a ""simulator"" or additional assumptions. Concretely, we prove that an optimistic modification of Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI)---a classical algorithm frequently studied in the linear setting---achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret, where $d$ is the ambient dimension of feature space, $H$ is the length of each episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps. Importantly, such regret is independent of the number of states and actions.",0
"This paper presents a provably efficient reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes linear function approximation. Our approach achieves efficiency by balancing exploration and exploitation using a novel method that adapts the tradeoff between these two goals based on the uncertainty of the agent's beliefs. We provide theoretical guarantees on both the sample complexity and regret bounds of our algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding near-optimal policies quickly and efficiently. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of continuous control tasks, providing evidence of its real-world impact. Overall, our work advances the field of reinforcement learning and paves the way for more efficient and effective algorithms in complex domains.",1
"Sequences play an important role in many applications and systems. Discovering sequences with desired properties has long been an interesting intellectual pursuit. This paper puts forth a new paradigm, AlphaSeq, to discover desired sequences algorithmically using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. AlphaSeq treats the sequence discovery problem as an episodic symbol-filling game, in which a player fills symbols in the vacant positions of a sequence set sequentially during an episode of the game. Each episode ends with a completely-filled sequence set, upon which a reward is given based on the desirability of the sequence set. AlphaSeq models the game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and adapts the DRL framework of AlphaGo to solve the MDP. Sequences discovered improve progressively as AlphaSeq, starting as a novice, learns to become an expert game player through many episodes of game playing. Compared with traditional sequence construction by mathematical tools, AlphaSeq is particularly suitable for problems with complex objectives intractable to mathematical analysis. We demonstrate the searching capabilities of AlphaSeq in two applications: 1) AlphaSeq successfully rediscovers a set of ideal complementary codes that can zero-force all potential interferences in multi-carrier CDMA systems. 2) AlphaSeq discovers new sequences that triple the signal-to-interference ratio -- benchmarked against the well-known Legendre sequence -- of a mismatched filter estimator in pulse compression radar systems.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great promise in sequence discovery tasks such as music composition, game playing, natural language generation, among others. One critical component that has been missing from these models is an exploration mechanism which can encourage them to explore unseen states in their search space, leading to more novel and diverse outputs. We introduce AlphaSeq, a model based on the deep reinforcement learning framework, using neural networks trained by imitation learning. Our approach uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to guide exploration during training. Our experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and quality of solutions generated across multiple benchmark datasets. Overall, our work demonstrates the viability of combining imitation learning with MCTS for enhancing sequence discovery performance in deep learning systems.",1
"Rewards are sparse in the real world and most of today's reinforcement learning algorithms struggle with such sparsity. One solution to this problem is to allow the agent to create rewards for itself - thus making rewards dense and more suitable for learning. In particular, inspired by curious behaviour in animals, observing something novel could be rewarded with a bonus. Such bonus is summed up with the real task reward - making it possible for RL algorithms to learn from the combined reward. We propose a new curiosity method which uses episodic memory to form the novelty bonus. To determine the bonus, the current observation is compared with the observations in memory. Crucially, the comparison is done based on how many environment steps it takes to reach the current observation from those in memory - which incorporates rich information about environment dynamics. This allows us to overcome the known ""couch-potato"" issues of prior work - when the agent finds a way to instantly gratify itself by exploiting actions which lead to hardly predictable consequences. We test our approach in visually rich 3D environments in ViZDoom, DMLab and MuJoCo. In navigational tasks from ViZDoom and DMLab, our agent outperforms the state-of-the-art curiosity method ICM. In MuJoCo, an ant equipped with our curiosity module learns locomotion out of the first-person-view curiosity only.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to curiosity-driven exploration using episodic memory and reachability analysis. We introduce a measure of ""episodic curiosity"" that captures how surprising and unique each state visit is based on an agent's past experience. Our method uses reachability analysis to identify states that are both achievable from the current state and have high episodic curiosity scores, guiding the agent towards more diverse and informative experiences. Through experiments on several benchmark domains, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved performance across multiple metrics compared to baseline methods that rely solely on optimality or randomness. Additionally, we show that our algorithm effectively balances exploitation and exploration by efficiently gathering valuable information while minimizing overlap between visited states. Overall, our work contributes to the field of artificial intelligence by providing a principled framework for achieving effective curiosity-driven exploration in complex environments.",1
"We investigate a classification problem using multiple mobile agents capable of collecting (partial) pose-dependent observations of an unknown environment. The objective is to classify an image over a finite time horizon. We propose a network architecture on how agents should form a local belief, take local actions, and extract relevant features from their raw partial observations. Agents are allowed to exchange information with their neighboring agents to update their own beliefs. It is shown how reinforcement learning techniques can be utilized to achieve decentralized implementation of the classification problem by running a decentralized consensus protocol. Our experimental results on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",0
"In this paper we propose a method for training deep neural networks (DNNs) using reinforcement learning. Our approach uses multiple agents that learn to solve different parts of the image classification problem simultaneously. We use asynchronous updates during the DNN’s training process so each agent can focus on solving specific subproblems independently. This allows us to leverage the strengths of distributed computing systems such as TensorFlow Distributed without having to partition datasets across machines. By enabling concurrent exploration at different granularities, our method is able to achieve better results compared to previous methods that rely solely on batch gradient descent. Additionally, by sharing knowledge amongst all agents, our framework enables rapid adaptation to changes in the environment. Experimental evaluations show promising performance improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms trained with both synchronous and asynchronous SGD under different data availability scenarios. These findings confirm that RL based multiagent optimization is a powerful tool for leveraging distributed systems to improve model quality and reduce time-to-solution when dealing with large scale machine learning problems.",1
"This paper presents a safe learning framework that employs an adaptive model learning algorithm together with barrier certificates for systems with possibly nonstationary agent dynamics. To extract the dynamic structure of the model, we use a sparse optimization technique. We use the learned model in combination with control barrier certificates which constrain policies (feedback controllers) in order to maintain safety, which refers to avoiding particular undesirable regions of the state space. Under certain conditions, recovery of safety in the sense of Lyapunov stability after violations of safety due to the nonstationarity is guaranteed. In addition, we reformulate an action-value function approximation to make any kernel-based nonlinear function estimation method applicable to our adaptive learning framework. Lastly, solutions to the barrier-certified policy optimization are guaranteed to be globally optimal, ensuring the greedy policy improvement under mild conditions. The resulting framework is validated via simulations of a quadrotor, which has previously been used under stationarity assumptions in the safe learnings literature, and is then tested on a real robot, the brushbot, whose dynamics is unknown, highly complex and nonstationary.",0
"An abstract is a brief summary that conveys the main points of a research paper without going into great detail. Here's an example of an abstract:  Adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) has proven successful in many applications, but often requires manually tuning hyperparameters such as learning rates and discount factors. We propose barrier-certified RL (BCRL), which automatically determines these parameters using mathematical guarantees. Our approach ensures convergence to optimal policies and improves sample efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. We apply BCRL to brushbot navigation and demonstrate significantly better performance compared to both manual tuning and other RL algorithms. Overall, our work enables effective deployment of RL in complex real-world settings while reducing the need for human expertise.  The paper offers original contributions by introducing the novel concept of barrier certification to adaptive RL and evaluating its efficacy through extensive experimental studies on challenging tasks like brushbot navigation. We discuss theoretical insights, implementation details, and ablation studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodology and its limitations. Our findings suggest promising directions for future research aimed at developing more efficient and generalizable reinforcement learning techniques.",1
"This paper considers the problem of image set-based face verification and identification. Unlike traditional single sample (an image or a video) setting, this situation assumes the availability of a set of heterogeneous collection of orderless images and videos. The samples can be taken at different check points, different identity documents $etc$. The importance of each image is usually considered either equal or based on a quality assessment of that image independent of other images and/or videos in that image set. How to model the relationship of orderless images within a set remains a challenge. We address this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a latent space. Specifically, we first propose a dependency-aware attention control (DAC) network, which uses actor-critic reinforcement learning for attention decision of each image to exploit the correlations among the unordered images. An off-policy experience replay is introduced to speed up the learning process. Moreover, the DAC is combined with a temporal model for videos using divide and conquer strategies. We also introduce a pose-guided representation (PGR) scheme that can further boost the performance at extreme poses. We propose a parameter-free PGR without the need for training as well as a novel metric learning-based PGR for pose alignment without the need for pose detection in testing stage. Extensive evaluations on IJB-A/B/C, YTF, Celebrity-1000 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-art approaches on the set-based as well as video-based face recognition databases.",0
"In today’s world, image recognition has become increasingly important due to its applications in real life scenarios such as security systems, medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and content-based image retrieval. Image set based recognition (ISBR) involves recognizing multiple images together instead of individual images. This approach leads to improved accuracy over traditional single shot recognition methods but requires careful handling of attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of each image. We propose a new method using metric learning alignment to learn attention control. By aligning the features from different modalities together using triplets constraints, we can improve inter feature dependencies between different images, resulting in better performance than baseline models which rely solely on deep networks to generate attentions. Our experiments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art ISBR approaches across several benchmark datasets including SUN dataset, MINCIIIC III, PEIS, UIUC Sports, Paris Street View, Oxford Buildings, and Holidays among others while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.",1
"We propose the use of a proportional-derivative (PD) control based policy learned via reinforcement learning (RL) to estimate and forecast 3D human pose from egocentric videos. The method learns directly from unsegmented egocentric videos and motion capture data consisting of various complex human motions (e.g., crouching, hopping, bending, and motion transitions). We propose a video-conditioned recurrent control technique to forecast physically-valid and stable future motions of arbitrary length. We also introduce a value function based fail-safe mechanism which enables our method to run as a single pass algorithm over the video data. Experiments with both controlled and in-the-wild data show that our approach outperforms previous art in both quantitative metrics and visual quality of the motions, and is also robust enough to transfer directly to real-world scenarios. Additionally, our time analysis shows that the combined use of our pose estimation and forecasting can run at 30 FPS, making it suitable for real-time applications.",0
"In robotic motion control systems, accurate ego-pose estimation is essential to achieve smooth and stable movements that closely match desired trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on offline model learning and optimization techniques, which may not provide real-time performance suitable for online, feedback-based control applications. This study presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to directly estimate the current pose of the system, without explicitly computing forward kinematics or Jacobian transposes. We demonstrate how our method can improve upon traditional inverse dynamics approaches by incorporating contact forces and handling nonlinearities, frictions, and other unmodeled disturbances present in physical systems. Additionally, we propose a technique for online forecasting of future poses that takes into account uncertainty arising from noisy sensor measurements and model approximations. Our experimental evaluation shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of tracking accuracy and disturbance rejection capabilities, making our framework well suited for deployments requiring precise and robust motion control in uncertain environments.",1
"Training deep reinforcement learning agents complex behaviors in 3D virtual environments requires significant computational resources. This is especially true in environments with high degrees of aliasing, where many states share nearly identical visual features. Minecraft is an exemplar of such an environment. We hypothesize that interactive machine learning IML, wherein human teachers play a direct role in training through demonstrations, critique, or action advice, may alleviate agent susceptibility to aliasing. However, interactive machine learning is only practical when the number of human interactions is limited, requiring a balance between human teacher effort and agent performance. We conduct experiments with two reinforcement learning algorithms which enable human teachers to give action advice, Feedback Arbitration and Newtonian Action Advice, under visual aliasing conditions. To assess potential cognitive load per advice type, we vary the accuracy and frequency of various human action advice techniques. Training efficiency, robustness against infrequent and inaccurate advisor input, and sensitivity to aliasing are examined.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective at solving complex tasks within games like Minecraft. However, current methods still have limitations that prevent them from scaling well across different environments, such as varying terrain and enemy distributions. In our work, we propose using action advice to improve deep reinforcement learning algorithms in Minecraft by providing additional guidance during training. We demonstrate that action advice can significantly reduce the amount of experience required to achieve high levels of performance while improving sample efficiency. Our method outperforms strong baselines on multiple maps with different settings and challenges, further showing its generalizability across distinct domains. Additionally, we provide insight into the role of action advice as both a regularizer and implicit curriculum generator, highlighting its importance in enabling effective learning with sparse rewards. Our findings suggest that incorporating action advice is a promising direction towards making advances in reinforcement learning in Minecraft and beyond.",1
"Video Recognition has drawn great research interest and great progress has been made. A suitable frame sampling strategy can improve the accuracy and efficiency of recognition. However, mainstream solutions generally adopt hand-crafted frame sampling strategies for recognition. It could degrade the performance, especially in untrimmed videos, due to the variation of frame-level saliency. To this end, we concentrate on improving untrimmed video classification via developing a learning-based frame sampling strategy. We intuitively formulate the frame sampling procedure as multiple parallel Markov decision processes, each of which aims at picking out a frame/clip by gradually adjusting an initial sampling. Then we propose to solve the problems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Our MARL framework is composed of a novel RNN-based context-aware observation network which jointly models context information among nearby agents and historical states of a specific agent, a policy network which generates the probability distribution over a predefined action space at each step and a classification network for reward calculation as well as final recognition. Extensive experimental results show that our MARL-based scheme remarkably outperforms hand-crafted strategies with various 2D and 3D baseline methods. Our single RGB model achieves a comparable performance of ActivityNet v1.3 champion submission with multi-modal multi-model fusion and new state-of-the-art results on YouTube Birds and YouTube Cars.",0
"Abstract: In order to obtain effective video recognition results using reinforcement learning techniques, a multi-agent approach can be adopted to learn efficient frame sampling policies that capture important frames from untrimmed videos. This paper proposes a novel framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with frame-level parallelization that enables multiple agents to work together towards optimizing their individual objectives related to selecting informative frames. To model the interactions between different agents, we develop an attention mechanism inspired by natural language processing (NLP), which encourages agents to focus more closely on features relevant to other members’ decisions. Our experiments show that our proposed method leads to significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency metrics such as mean average precision (mAP) and inference time per second (frames/second). Additionally, ablation studies demonstrate the importance of the proposed components and extensions, including the MARL optimization algorithm, attention module design choices, agent synchronizations, and the use of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Overall, the introduced frame sampling scheme significantly improves the effectiveness of deep learning systems in challenging tasks like temporal action detection and moment localization from raw video streams.",1
"Future robots should follow human social norms in order to be useful and accepted in human society. In this paper, we leverage already existing social knowledge in human societies by capturing it in our framework through the notion of social norms. We show how norms can be used to guide a reinforcement learning agent towards achieving normative behavior and apply the same set of norms over different domains. Thus, we are able to: (1) provide a way to intuitively encode social knowledge (through norms); (2) guide learning towards normative behaviors (through an automatic norm reward system); and (3) achieve a transfer of learning by abstracting policies; Finally, (4) the method is not dependent on a particular RL algorithm. We show how our approach can be seen as a means to achieve abstract representation and learn procedural knowledge based on the declarative semantics of norms and discuss possible implications of this in some areas of cognitive science.",0
"This paper examines how institutions can play a key role in shaping normative behavior through socialization processes that teach individuals the appropriate ways to act within society. Drawing on examples from literature and popular culture, we demonstrate that institutions such as schools, families, churches, and governments can provide clear expectations and consequences for certain behaviors, which in turn leads to internalized moral values and social norm compliance among individuals. We argue that while institutional environments may vary across cultures, these mechanisms of norm socialization remain universal and operate according to similar principles. Further, we discuss the implications of our findings for policy and interventions aimed at promoting prosocial behavior and reducing criminal activity. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the complex interaction between individual agency, cultural context, and institutional structures in shaping human behavior.",1
"Language systems have been of great interest to the research community and have recently reached the mass market through various assistant platforms on the web. Reinforcement Learning methods that optimize dialogue policies have seen successes in past years and have recently been extended into methods that personalize the dialogue, e.g. take the personal context of users into account. These works, however, are limited to personalization to a single user with whom they require multiple interactions and do not generalize the usage of context across users. This work introduces a problem where a generalized usage of context is relevant and proposes two Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches to this problem. The first approach uses a single learner and extends the traditional POMDP formulation of dialogue state with features that describe the user context. The second approach segments users by context and then employs a learner per context. We compare these approaches in a benchmark of existing non-RL and RL-based methods in three established and one novel application domain of financial product recommendation. We compare the influence of context and training experiences on performance and find that learning approaches generally outperform a handcrafted gold standard.",0
"Title: Adapting to Individual User Preferences in Conversational Systems using Deep Reinforcement Learning  In recent years, conversational systems have gained significant attention due to their potential to improve human-machine interaction. These systems aim to simulate natural language conversation by understanding user intentions, providing relevant responses, and engaging users through contextual interactions. However, current approaches for building these systems face several challenges that hinder their effectiveness, such as difficulty in handling diverse intents and requirements across different users and domains, poor adaptation to changes in user behavior over time, and limited ability to maintain coherence and relevance throughout lengthy conversations.  This paper presents a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address these challenges and improve personalization in conversational systems. Our method leverages actor-critic models to optimize dialogue management policies, considering both global reward signals and fine-grained feedback from individual turns. We propose a two-stage training framework that first pre-trains the policy network to predict likelihood scores for candidate actions given input utterances, then finetunes it towards maximizing cumulative rewards. This combination allows our system to learn more efficiently from large datasets while still capturing nuanced patterns specific to each user.  To evaluate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments involving thousands of real-world human-generated queries and synthetic ones mimicking complex behaviors. Results showed consistent improvements in terms of overall utility measures compared to strong baselines like sequence-to-sequence models augmented with external memories. Moreover, user studies demonstrated higher levels of perceived fluency and responsiveness in our generated responses.  Our work demonstrates the feasibility of applying DRL techniques to enhance personalization in conversational systems, thereby enabling more effective interactions betwee",1
"Control policies, trained using the Deep Reinforcement Learning, have been recently shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks introducing even very small perturbations to the policy input. The attacks proposed so far have been designed using heuristics, and build on existing adversarial example crafting techniques used to dupe classifiers in supervised learning. In contrast, this paper investigates the problem of devising optimal attacks, depending on a well-defined attacker's objective, e.g., to minimize the main agent average reward. When the policy and the system dynamics, as well as rewards, are known to the attacker, a scenario referred to as a white-box attack, designing optimal attacks amounts to solving a Markov Decision Process. For what we call black-box attacks, where neither the policy nor the system is known, optimal attacks can be trained using Reinforcement Learning techniques. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our attacks compared to existing attacks (usually based on Gradient methods). We further quantify the potential impact of attacks and establish its connection to the smoothness of the policy under attack. Smooth policies are naturally less prone to attacks (this explains why Lipschitz policies, with respect to the state, are more resilient). Finally, we show that from the main agent perspective, the system uncertainties and the attacker can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We actually demonstrate that using Reinforcement Learning techniques tailored to POMDP (e.g. using Recurrent Neural Networks) leads to more resilient policies.",0
"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of optimal attacks on reinforcement learning policies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms as a means of controlling complex systems such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other artificial intelligence applications. However, these RL models can be vulnerable to manipulation by attackers who aim to disrupt their performance or steer them towards undesirable behaviors. In light of these concerns, it is crucial to study how adversaries can exploit weaknesses in RL policies and develop effective mitigation strategies.  The authors begin by discussing different types of attacks that can be launched against RL agents, including policy imitation, reward poisoning, and decision randomization. These attacks seek to deceive the agent into making incorrect decisions, leading to catastrophic consequences. The authors then propose novel methods for mounting optimal attacks against RL policies, taking into account the specifics of each attack scenario and the characteristics of the targeted model. They evaluate their approaches through extensive simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of their techniques under real-world conditions. Finally, they explore potential countermeasures that could thwart attacks on RL agents and make recommendations for future research directions.  This work provides valuable insights into the risks associated with deploying RL-based systems and underscores the importance of considering security during design and implementation phases. By shedding light on optimal attacks on RL policies, the paper offers essential guidance for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers working in areas where these models might be employed. Overall, the findings presented here have significant implications for advancing secure RL development and ensure safe deployment of AI technologies in critical domains.",1
"We consider the problem of learning to behave optimally in a Markov Decision Process when a reward function is not specified, but instead we have access to a set of demonstrators of varying performance. We assume the demonstrators are classified into one of k ranks, and use ideas from ordinal regression to find a reward function that maximizes the margin between the different ranks. This approach is based on the idea that agents should not only learn how to behave from experts, but also how not to behave from non-experts. We show there are MDPs where important differences in the reward function would be hidden from existing algorithms by the behaviour of the expert. Our method is particularly useful for problems where we have access to a large set of agent behaviours with varying degrees of expertise (such as through GPS or cellphones). We highlight the differences between our approach and existing methods using a simple grid domain and demonstrate its efficacy on determining passenger-finding strategies for taxi drivers, using a large dataset of GPS trajectories.",0
"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a field that seeks to learn an agent's reward function from observations of their behavior in an environment. This can enable machines to understand human preferences and make decisions accordingly. However, previous IRL methods have focused on single experts without considering situations where there may be multiple ranked experts providing advice. To address this limitation, we propose using multiple ranked experts to improve inverse reinforcement learning. By modeling expert confidence levels and incorporating them into the IRL algorithm, our method can better handle uncertainty and outperform traditional IRL approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using multiple ranked experts for improved inverse reinforcement learning performance across different domains.",1
"We describe an application of Wasserstein distance to Reinforcement Learning. The Wasserstein distance in question is between the distribution of mappings of trajectories of a policy into some metric space, and some other fixed distribution (which may, for example, come from another policy). Different policies induce different distributions, so given an underlying metric, the Wasserstein distance quantifies how different policies are. This can be used to learn multiple polices which are different in terms of such Wasserstein distances by using a Wasserstein regulariser. Changing the sign of the regularisation parameter, one can learn a policy for which its trajectory mapping distribution is attracted to a given fixed distribution.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), agents learn to make sequential decisions in uncertain environments by maximizing cumulative reward over time. While policy gradient methods have been widely used in RL due to their simplicity and stability, they can suffer from instability issues such as high variance policy updates and lack of diversity in policies explored during training. To address these limitations, we introduce a new regularization method based on the concept of transportation cost, measured using theWasserstein distance between two probability distributions representing state visitation probabilities of multiple policies under the same initial conditions. Our proposed approach regularizes policy update steps towards smoother changes and induces a diversification effect between learned policies. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmark tasks across varying amounts of data provided, demonstrating improved performance compared to other recent regularized policy optimization techniques. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support our experimental results that demonstrates how regularizing policy gradients with Wasserstein distances encourages more conservative yet effective policy improvement steps. Our work provides insights into the benefits of incorporating geodesic distance measures such as those induced by the 2-Wasserstein metric between policies within the RL framework, which could potentially lead to further improvements beyond the scope of this paper.",1
"Reinforcement learning agents are prone to undesired behaviors due to reward mis-specification. Finding a set of reward functions to properly guide agent behaviors is particularly challenging in multi-agent scenarios. Inverse reinforcement learning provides a framework to automatically acquire suitable reward functions from expert demonstrations. Its extension to multi-agent settings, however, is difficult due to the more complex notions of rational behaviors. In this paper, we propose MA-AIRL, a new framework for multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning, which is effective and scalable for Markov games with high-dimensional state-action space and unknown dynamics. We derive our algorithm based on a new solution concept and maximum pseudolikelihood estimation within an adversarial reward learning framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate that MA-AIRL can recover reward functions that are highly correlated with ground truth ones, and significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of policy imitation.",0
"""Multi-agent adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (MARIL) is a relatively new field that involves training agents to predict the behavior of other agents in complex environments. These predictions can then be used to guide decision making and improve overall system performance. In traditional IRL, a single agent learns to approximate the rewards of another agent by observing their actions over time. However, in MARIL, multiple agents are present and may have conflicting objectives or goals. This creates challenges as each agent must learn to anticipate the actions of others while maximizing their own reward signal. This paper presents a methodology for implementing MARIL using deep neural networks. Our approach uses both policy gradient methods and imitation learning techniques to train our agents on large scale simulation data. We demonstrate our method’s effectiveness through several case studies involving both cooperative and competitive multi-agent scenarios.""",1
"In several reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, mainly in security settings, there may be adversaries trying to interfere with the reward generating process.

After introducing our framework and deriving theoretical results, relevant empirical evidence is given via extensive experiments, showing the benefits of accounting for adversaries while the agent learns.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars and drones. As these systems become more advanced and autonomous, ensuring their safety becomes crucial. One approach to guaranteeing safe AI behavior is through reinforcement learning (RL), where agents learn by maximizing rewards received from the environment. However, current RL algorithms face significant challenges when dealing with potential threats that can cause harm to both humans and other entities. This paper presents novel methods for developing RL models capable of making decisions under threats without jeopardizing safety measures. Our study contributes to mitigating catastrophic failure situations in which AI systems may act inappropriately due to insufficient threat recognition.

"This sounds like quite a challenging task! Controlling any kind of greenhouse system can be difficult enough as it is, but one that is nonlinear and has unknown elements (the ""black box"" component) adds another layer of complexity on top of everything else.

In short, don't underestimate how tricky controlling certain types of greenhouses can be - but at least now we have some tools at our disposal to make the job easier!",1
"The sample inefficiency of standard deep reinforcement learning methods precludes their application to many real-world problems. Methods which leverage human demonstrations require fewer samples but have been researched less. As demonstrated in the computer vision and natural language processing communities, large-scale datasets have the capacity to facilitate research by serving as an experimental and benchmarking platform for new methods. However, existing datasets compatible with reinforcement learning simulators do not have sufficient scale, structure, and quality to enable the further development and evaluation of methods focused on using human examples. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive, large-scale, simulator-paired dataset of human demonstrations: MineRL. The dataset consists of over 60 million automatically annotated state-action pairs across a variety of related tasks in Minecraft, a dynamic, 3D, open-world environment. We present a novel data collection scheme which allows for the ongoing introduction of new tasks and the gathering of complete state information suitable for a variety of methods.

"This paper presents ""MineRL"" - a large-scale dataset of demonstration videos of human players performing tasks within the popular game Minecraft. Our goal was to create a diverse set of challenging yet achievable goals for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to learn from, building upon previous work that has focused on isolated tasks. To achieve this, we collected data from experienced gamers who performed tasks across multiple domains, including construction, gathering, exploration, combat, transportation, and more. We then preprocessed the raw footage into smaller clips and created corresponding text descriptions and reward functions. In addition, we released code and trained models alongside our dataset to facilitate easier experimentation by researchers interested in RL. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher performance compared to existing benchmarks using RL techniques. Future directions may involve expanding the scope of tasks to further improve generalization abilities among agents, or utilizing transfer learning to adapt from other datasets such as Roboschool. Ultimately, we believe our large scale dataset provides both researchers and hobbyists alike a valuable tool for advancing state of art methods for training intelligent agents in complex environments. ------------------------------  To summarize, our approach leverages expert human play to generate a high quality, well rounded dataset of mine craft examples suitable for developing intelligence in video games(RL).

"Title: Automatic Detection of Pneumothorax on Chest Radiographs Using Deep Learning  Abstract: Pneumothorax is a potentially life threatening condition that can occur following chest trauma, lung surgery, or spontaneously, often in patients with other respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Early detection of pneumothorax is critical for prompt treatment and management. However, radiologists may overlook small pleural effusions or early stage pneumothoraces due to their subtle appearance on chest radiographs. In this study, we present a deep learning algorithm for automatic detection of pneumothorax from frontal view posteroanterior (PA) chest radiographs.

"How to best explore in domains with sparse, delayed, and deceptive rewards is an important open problem for reinforcement learning (RL). This paper considers one such domain, the recently-proposed multi-agent benchmark of Pommerman. This domain is very challenging for RL --- past work has shown that model-free RL algorithms fail to achieve significant learning without artificially reducing the environment's complexity. In this paper, we illuminate reasons behind this failure by providing a thorough analysis on the hardness of random exploration in Pommerman. While model-free random exploration is typically futile, we develop a model-based automatic reasoning module that can be used for safer exploration by pruning actions that will surely lead the agent to death. We empirically demonstrate that this module can significantly improve learning.",0

"In many real-world decision making problems, reaching an optimal decision requires taking into account a variable number of objects around the agent. Autonomous driving is a domain in which this is especially relevant, since the number of cars surrounding the agent varies considerably over time and affects the optimal action to be taken. Classical methods that process object lists can deal with this requirement. However, to take advantage of recent high-performing methods based on deep reinforcement learning in modular pipelines, special architectures are necessary. For these, a number of options exist, but a thorough comparison of the different possibilities is missing. In this paper, we elaborate limitations of fully-connected neural networks and other established approaches like convolutional and recurrent neural networks in the context of reinforcement learning problems that have to deal with variable sized inputs. We employ the structure of Deep Sets in off-policy reinforcement learning for high-level decision making, highlight their capabilities to alleviate these limitations, and show that Deep Sets not only yield the best overall performance but also offer better generalization to unseen situations than the other approaches.",0
"In autonomous driving, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach to imitating human decision making under uncertainty from raw sensory inputs.

"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex decision-making problems across diverse domains. However, training DRL agents can often be difficult due to issues related to exploration, sample complexity, and high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To address these challenges, we propose the use of terminal prediction as an auxiliary task for improving both efficiency and performance in DRL.  We frame the problem of terminal prediction as predicting the likelihood that each state leads to a predefined goal state using neural networks. By integrating this additional task into the agent's objective function through a shared representation, we aim to improve the ability of the agent to learn more efficiently from its interactions with the environment.  Through extensive experiments on several benchmark tasks, including those derived from real-world applications such as robotics and finance, we demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms strong baselines. Specifically, we show that incorporating terminal prediction leads to faster convergence rates and improved asymptotic performances relative to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by analyzing the effects of hyperparameter settings and network architectures, we provide insights into why terminal prediction is effective at accelerating DRL learning.  Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of incorporating terminal prediction as an auxiliary task in DRL and paves the way for future research focused on exploiting complementary objectives to enhance the effectiveness of DRL algorithms.",1
"Decision support systems (e.g., for ecological conservation) and autonomous systems (e.g., adaptive controllers in smart cities) start to be deployed in real applications. Although their operations often impact many users or stakeholders, no fairness consideration is generally taken into account in their design, which could lead to completely unfair outcomes for some users or stakeholders. To tackle this issue, we advocate for the use of social welfare functions that encode fairness and present this general novel problem in the context of (deep) reinforcement learning, although it could possibly be extended to other machine learning tasks.",0
"This paper explores the concept of fairness in reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to ensuring that decisions made by RL algorithms align with societal values such as equality and justice. We begin by providing an overview of RL and discussing how traditional approaches can lead to unfair outcomes due to their reliance on objective function optimization alone. Then, we present several methods for promoting fairness in RL, including adding constraints to optimize jointly for multiple objectives, using game theory to model interactions between different agents or populations, and incorporating prior knowledge from human domain experts into the decision making process. We evaluate these techniques through simulation experiments and demonstrate their ability to improve the fairness of RL decision making across various domains. Finally, we conclude by highlighting key challenges and future research directions in advancing the field of fair RL. Our work contributes to the larger conversation around ethical artificial intelligence and underscores the importance of developing algorithms that align with social norms and values.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. DRL models have been attacked by adding perturbations to observations. While such observation based attack is only one aspect of potential attacks on DRL, other forms of attacks which are more practical require further analysis, such as manipulating environment dynamics. Therefore, we propose to understand the vulnerabilities of DRL from various perspectives and provide a thorough taxonomy of potential attacks. We conduct the first set of experiments on the unexplored parts within the taxonomy. In addition to current observation based attacks against DRL, we propose the first targeted attacks based on action space and environment dynamics. We also introduce the online sequential attacks based on temporal consistency information among frames. To better estimate gradient in black-box setting, we propose a sampling strategy and theoretically prove its efficiency and estimation error bound. We conduct extensive experiments to compare the effectiveness of different attacks with several baselines in various environments, including game playing, robotics control, and autonomous driving.",0
"This paper presents a comprehensive study on attacks against deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Despite their success in solving complex tasks, DRL agents remain vulnerable to adversarial examples that can alter their behavior and cause them to make incorrect decisions. In order to characterize these attacks and better understand how they work, we evaluate several popular attack methods across different domains and models. Our results show that existing attacks can effectively manipulate DRL agents into making mistakes, but there are ways to mitigate these threats by improving model robustness or using detection mechanisms. We provide insights into the limitations and strengths of current attack techniques and discuss future research directions towards building more secure DRL systems.",1
"Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) intend to ensure robustness with respect to changing or adversarial system behavior. In this framework, transitions are modeled as arbitrary elements of a known and properly structured uncertainty set and a robust optimal policy can be derived under the worst-case scenario. In this study, we address the issue of learning in RMDPs using a Bayesian approach. We introduce the Uncertainty Robust Bellman Equation (URBE) which encourages safe exploration for adapting the uncertainty set to new observations while preserving robustness. We propose a URBE-based algorithm, DQN-URBE, that scales this method to higher dimensional domains. Our experiments show that the derived URBE-based strategy leads to a better trade-off between less conservative solutions and robustness in the presence of model misspecification. In addition, we show that the DQN-URBE algorithm can adapt significantly faster to changing dynamics online compared to existing robust techniques with fixed uncertainty sets.",0
"In Reinforcement learning, it is well known that rewards must be carefully chosen if agents are to learn effectively; otherwise, they may take actions which increase the reward function but violate our intentions. We argue that in order for reinforcement leaning to work in real world scenarios it must be robust against uncertainties, whether these arise from noisy percepts, uncertainty over action effects, stochasticity within environments or even self-uncertainty on behalf of the agent itself. To achieve this we propose an approach based upon Bayes theorem where uncertainty is explicitly modelled using probability distributions. This allows us to both reason about expected behaviour and make predictions when observations differ significantly from expectation. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional models in terms of performance, resilience to uncertainty and ability to adapt to novel situations/tasks. Furthermore, by providing principled methodology we hope to enable researchers working in artificial intelligence to design more reliable intelligent systems.",1
"The detection of anatomical landmarks is a vital step for medical image analysis and applications for diagnosis, interpretation and guidance. Manual annotation of landmarks is a tedious process that requires domain-specific expertise and introduces inter-observer variability. This paper proposes a new detection approach for multiple landmarks based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our hypothesis is that the position of all anatomical landmarks is interdependent and non-random within the human anatomy, thus finding one landmark can help to deduce the location of others. Using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture we construct an environment and agent with implicit inter-communication such that we can accommodate K agents acting and learning simultaneously, while they attempt to detect K different landmarks. During training the agents collaborate by sharing their accumulated knowledge for a collective gain. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art architectures and achieve significantly better accuracy by reducing the detection error by 50%, while requiring fewer computational resources and time to train compared to the naive approach of training K agents separately.",0
"Title: ""Multiple Landmark Detection Using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for detecting multiple landmarks from images. In recent years, computer vision has seen rapid advancements due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning methods. However, many state-of-the-art systems require large amounts of annotated data for training and often struggle in scenarios where the objects of interest have varying scales and positions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a combination of centralized and decentralized techniques. Our method consists of several agents working together to locate multiple instances of a target object. Each agent is trained to recognize specific parts of the scene, making it easier to handle variations in scale and position. We use a deep Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for each agent in a fully distributed manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms traditional single-landmark detection methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence rates. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward towards automating image understanding tasks in complex scenes.",1

We examine several state-of-the-art DRL models suitable for healthcare applications and discuss their respective merits and limitations from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Our aim is to elucidate how these advanced computational techniques could improve patient outcomes through automating evidence-based decisions while incorporating real-world constraints. Ultimately, our hope is to inspire further research into adapting DRL methodologies as effective solutions for enhancing the accuracy, speed, and efficiency of critical decision-making processes within modern medical environments.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) constitutes a promising solution for alleviating the problem of traffic congestion. In particular, deep RL algorithms have been shown to produce adaptive traffic signal controllers that outperform conventional systems. However, in order to be reliable in highly dynamic urban areas, such controllers need to be robust with the respect to a series of exogenous sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we develop an open-source callback-based framework for promoting the flexible evaluation of different deep RL configurations under a traffic simulation environment. With this framework, we investigate how deep RL-based adaptive traffic controllers perform under different scenarios, namely under demand surges caused by special events, capacity reductions from incidents and sensor failures. We extract several key insights for the development of robust deep RL algorithms for traffic control and propose concrete designs to mitigate the impact of the considered exogenous uncertainties.",0
"This paper presents a robust deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for traffic signal control that can handle demand surges, incidents, and sensor failures. Traditional DRL approaches have shown promising results but struggle when faced with uncertainties such as traffic fluctuations and sensing errors.

We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations on real-world intersection datasets and demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms benchmark methods under different conditions. Additionally, we discuss insights gained from analyzing the learned policies and their implications for traffic management practices. Overall, our work highlights the potential of combining robust DRL techniques with sensitivity analysis for effective traffic signal control systems capable of adapting to changing environments.",1

"This paper augments the reward received by a reinforcement learning agent with potential functions in order to help the agent learn (possibly stochastic) optimal policies. We show that a potential-based reward shaping scheme is able to preserve optimality of stochastic policies, and demonstrate that the ability of an agent to learn an optimal policy is not affected when this scheme is augmented to soft Q-learning. We propose a method to impart potential based advice schemes to policy gradient algorithms. An algorithm that considers an advantage actor-critic architecture augmented with this scheme is proposed, and we give guarantees on its convergence. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a puddle-jump grid world with indistinguishable states, and the continuous state and action mountain car environment from classical control. Our results indicate that these schemes allow the agent to learn a stochastic optimal policy faster and obtain a higher average reward.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for stochastic policy learning that utilizes potential-based advice (PBA). PBA is a methodology that allows agents to learn policies based on expected future value, as opposed to just immediate rewards. By using PBA, agents can make better decisions that take into account both short-term gains and long-term consequences. In addition, this approach is well suited for use in real-world applications where accurate predictions of outcomes are difficult due to uncertainty and stochasticity. The proposed method has been tested through simulation experiments, and results show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, making it a promising solution for decision-making under uncertainty.",1
"We introduce Arena, a toolkit for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research. In MARL, it usually requires customizing observations, rewards and actions for each agent, changing cooperative-competitive agent-interaction, and playing with/against a third-party agent, etc. We provide a novel modular design, called Interface, for manipulating such routines in essentially two ways: 1) Different interfaces can be concatenated and combined, which extends the OpenAI Gym Wrappers concept to MARL scenarios. 2) During MARL training or testing, interfaces can be embedded in either wrapped OpenAI Gym compatible Environments or raw environment compatible Agents. We offer off-the-shelf interfaces for several popular MARL platforms, including StarCraft II, Pommerman, ViZDoom, Soccer, etc. The interfaces effectively support self-play RL and cooperative-competitive hybrid MARL. Also, Arena can be conveniently extended to your own favorite MARL platform.",0

Overall, our goal was to provide researchers and educators with an easy-to-use, extensible platform that facilitates rapid prototyping and experimentation in the field of MARL. We hope that Arena can serve as a foundation for future work on MARL, both by itself and through integration with other packages and libraries.",1
"In reinforcement learning algorithms, leveraging multiple views of the environment can improve the learning of complicated policies. In multi-view environments, due to the fact that the views may frequently suffer from partial observability, their level of importance are often different. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method and an attention mechanism in a multi-view environment. Each view can provide various representative information about the environment. Through our attention mechanism, our method generates a single feature representation of environment given its multiple views. It learns a policy to dynamically attend to each view based on its importance in the decision-making process. Through experiments, we show that our method outperforms its state-of-the-art baselines on TORCS racing car simulator and three other complex 3D environments with obstacles. We also provide experimental results to evaluate the performance of our method on noisy conditions and partial observation settings.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful approach to solving complex decision making problems. However, most current methods rely on simplified assumptions or approximations that limit their generality and applicability. This work proposes a new algorithm called actor-critic-attention (ACA), which can handle richer environments by allowing agents to attend selectively to different views. By doing so, we show that our algorithm achieves superior performance compared to prior methods on challenging benchmark tasks, and demonstrate the potential benefits of attending to multiple viewpoints in multi-agent systems. Our results suggest that ACA could provide new opportunities for using artificial intelligence to solve real world problems involving complex interactions among autonomous agents.",1
"Most known regret bounds for reinforcement learning are either episodic or assume an environment without traps. We derive a regret bound without making either assumption, by allowing the algorithm to occasionally delegate an action to an external advisor. We thus arrive at a setting of active one-shot model-based reinforcement learning that we call DRL (delegative reinforcement learning.) The algorithm we construct in order to demonstrate the regret bound is a variant of Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning supplemented by a subroutine that decides which actions should be delegated. The algorithm is not anytime, since the parameters must be adjusted according to the target time discount. Currently, our analysis is limited to Markov decision processes with finite numbers of hypotheses, states and actions.",0
"Here is a suggested abstract that meets your requirements: Abstract: Delegative reinforcement learning (DRL) combines traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods with human guidance through demonstration and feedback to overcome some of the limitations associated with fully autonomous learning agents. In particular, DRL agents can learn to efficiently explore complex environments while minimizing their exposure to undesirable states and actions that may lead them into ""traps"" – highly uncertain situations where they struggle to find meaningful rewards or progress toward their goals. By leveraging both machine intelligence and human expertise, delegative systems offer a promising approach for training intelligent assistants capable of performing challenging tasks under real-world constraints. This paper presents an overview of current research in DRL, discusses the benefits and drawbacks of different agent designs, and highlights future directions for improving these hybrid decision making frameworks.",1
"Off-policy learning is more unstable compared to on-policy learning in reinforcement learning (RL). One reason for the instability of off-policy learning is a discrepancy between the target ($\pi$) and behavior (b) policy distributions. The discrepancy between $\pi$ and b distributions can be alleviated by employing a smooth variant of the importance sampling (IS), such as the relative importance sampling (RIS). RIS has parameter $\beta\in[0, 1]$ which controls smoothness. To cope with instability, we present the first relative importance sampling-off-policy actor-critic (RIS-Off-PAC) model-free algorithms in RL. In our method, the network yields a target policy (the actor), a value function (the critic) assessing the current policy ($\pi$) using samples drawn from behavior policy. We use action value generated from the behavior policy in reward function to train our algorithm rather than from the target policy. We also use deep neural networks to train both actor and critic. We evaluated our algorithm on a number of Open AI Gym benchmark problems and demonstrate better or comparable performance to several state-of-the-art RL baselines.",0
"In deep reinforcement learning (RL), relative importance sampling has been shown to greatly improve the performance of actor critic methods. However, existing work on relative importance sampling assumes that the target policy is the same as the behavior policy used by the agent. This can lead to problems in practice since most RL algorithms use different policies for evaluation and optimization purposes. To address these issues, we propose a method called off-policy relative importance sampling which removes this assumption by using both the behavior and target policies as separate distributions over trajectories. Our approach is based on the principled framework of Kallstrom et al., but our implementation uses recent advances in distribution shaping and sample reuse to achieve greater efficiency and stability than previous methods. We evaluate our algorithm on several challenging continuous control tasks, showing that off-policy relative importance sampling leads to significant improvements over standard on-policy actor critics, including DDPG and SAC. Furthermore, our results suggest that efficient approximation techniques such as reusing samples from previously collected rollouts can provide further benefits when combined with relative importance sampling. Together, these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of off-policy relative importance sampling as a simple yet powerful technique for improving the scalability and reliability of modern deep RL algorithms.",1
"Recently, reinforcement learning models have achieved great success, completing complex tasks such as mastering Go and other games with higher scores than human players. Many of these models collect considerable data on the tasks and improve accuracy by extracting visual and time-series features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks, respectively. However, these networks have very high computational costs because they need to be trained by repeatedly using a large volume of past playing data. In this study, we propose a novel practical approach called reinforcement learning with convolutional reservoir computing (RCRC) model. The RCRC model has several desirable features: 1. it can extract visual and time-series features very fast because it uses random fixed-weight CNN and the reservoir computing model; 2. it does not require the training data to be stored because it extracts features without training and decides action with evolution strategy. Furthermore, the model achieves state of the art score in the popular reinforcement learning task. Incredibly, we find the random weight-fixed simple networks like only one dense layer network can also reach high score in the RL task.",0
"Artificial intelligence has been revolutionized by deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can automatically extract features from raw data and learn complex patterns from large datasets. However, these models have limitations due to their reliance on hand-engineered architectures, lack of interpretability, and difficulty in achieving stable performance. In our work, we propose Convolutional Reservoir Computing (CRC), which combines reservoir computing, a type of recurrent neural network that utilizes nonlinear dynamics to capture temporal correlations, with CNNs. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both models while mitigating their weaknesses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRC on several challenging tasks involving world modeling, including predictive uncertainty estimation and outlier detection. Our results show that CRC outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, establishing its potential for real-world applications. We believe that CRC represents a promising direction towards developing robust and interpretable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"An optimal feedback controller for a given Markov decision process (MDP) can in principle be synthesized by value or policy iteration. However, if the system dynamics and the reward function are unknown, a learning agent must discover an optimal controller via direct interaction with the environment. Such interactive data gathering commonly leads to divergence towards dangerous or uninformative regions of the state space unless additional regularization measures are taken. Prior works proposed bounding the information loss measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence at every policy improvement step to eliminate instability in the learning dynamics. In this paper, we consider a broader family of $f$-divergences, and more concretely $\alpha$-divergences, which inherit the beneficial property of providing the policy improvement step in closed form at the same time yielding a corresponding dual objective for policy evaluation. Such entropic proximal policy optimization view gives a unified perspective on compatible actor-critic architectures. In particular, common least-squares value function estimation coupled with advantage-weighted maximum likelihood policy improvement is shown to correspond to the Pearson $\chi^2$-divergence penalty. Other actor-critic pairs arise for various choices of the penalty-generating function $f$. On a concrete instantiation of our framework with the $\alpha$-divergence, we carry out asymptotic analysis of the solutions for different values of $\alpha$ and demonstrate the effects of the divergence function choice on common standard reinforcement learning problems.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in machine learning models that can make decisions based on probabilistic inference. One popular framework for these models is Markov decision processes (MDPs), which have proven effective in domains such as robotics, natural language processing, and game playing. However, MDPs suffer from a fundamental problem known as the ""curse of dimensionality,"" where the state space becomes too large to explore effectively as more complex behaviors are required. In this paper, we introduce entropic regularization as a method to overcome this curse by adding a term to the objective function that encourages exploration and reduces overfitting. We show through experiments on both synthetic problems and real-world datasets that our proposed approach leads to improved performance compared to baseline methods. Finally, we discuss potential applications of entropic regularization beyond MDPs, including other sequential decision making tasks where exploration is important.",1
"Despite the tremendous advances that have been made in the last decade on developing useful machine-learning applications, their wider adoption has been hindered by the lack of strong assurance guarantees that can be made about their behavior. In this paper, we consider how formal verification techniques developed for traditional software systems can be repurposed for verification of reinforcement learning-enabled ones, a particularly important class of machine learning systems. Rather than enforcing safety by examining and altering the structure of a complex neural network implementation, our technique uses blackbox methods to synthesizes deterministic programs, simpler, more interpretable, approximations of the network that can nonetheless guarantee desired safety properties are preserved, even when the network is deployed in unanticipated or previously unobserved environments. Our methodology frames the problem of neural network verification in terms of a counterexample and syntax-guided inductive synthesis procedure over these programs. The synthesis procedure searches for both a deterministic program and an inductive invariant over an infinite state transition system that represents a specification of an application's control logic. Additional specifications defining environment-based constraints can also be provided to further refine the search space. Synthesized programs deployed in conjunction with a neural network implementation dynamically enforce safety conditions by monitoring and preventing potentially unsafe actions proposed by neural policies. Experimental results over a wide range of cyber-physical applications demonstrate that software-inspired formal verification techniques can be used to realize trustworthy reinforcement learning systems with low overhead.",0
"Title: ""Verifiable Reinforcement Learning via Inductive Synthesis""  This work presents a novel framework for verifiable reinforcement learning (RL), which combines inductive synthesis techniques from program analysis with RL algorithms that produce policies directly interpretable as programs. This approach enables us to achieve scalability by reducing search space while ensuring policy correctness through logical reasoning guided by inductively constructed safety constraints. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional model-free methods on complex benchmarks, making our method applicable to real-world applications where safe behavior is critical. By enabling the use of verified policies in autonomous systems, we take one step closer towards achieving trustworthy artificial intelligence.",1
"We present a training pipeline for the autonomous driving task given the current camera image and vehicle speed as the input to produce the throttle, brake, and steering control output. The simulator Airsim's convenient weather and lighting API provides a sufficient diversity during training which can be very helpful to increase the trained policy's robustness. In order to not limit the possible policy's performance, we use a continuous and deterministic control policy setting. We utilize ResNet-34 as our actor and critic networks with some slight changes in the fully connected layers. Considering human's mastery of this task and the high-complexity nature of this task, we first use imitation learning to mimic the given human policy and leverage the trained policy and its weights to the reinforcement learning phase for which we use DDPG. This combination shows a considerable performance boost comparing to both pure imitation learning and pure DDPG for the autonomous driving task.",0
"This paper presents an approach to improve reinforcement learning (RL) for image-based autonomous driving by pretraining the RL agent using imitation learning on large amounts of human demonstration data. The approach has two main stages: first, an actor-critic RL model is trained on a high-fidelity simulation environment; then, the trained model is transferred to real-world settings where it can interact with the physical world. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves both performance speedup and sample efficiency compared to standard RL methods without prior knowledge transfer from imitation learning. The key contributions of this work include developing an effective framework for combining imitation learning and RL towards enabling fully autonomous vehicles operating in complex urban environments. Additionally, we provide insights into how the quality of human demonstrations affects the final performance and discuss promising future research directions in the field of autonomous driving. Overall, our findings suggest that incorporating knowledge learned from human demonstrations can effectively enhance the capabilities of current autonomy systems.",1
"During the development of autonomous systems such as driverless cars, it is important to characterize the scenarios that are most likely to result in failure. Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) provides a way to search for the most-likely failure scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our previous work used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solver to identify likely failure scenarios. However, the solver's use of a feed-forward neural network with a discretized space of possible initial conditions poses two major problems. First, the system is not treated as a black box, in that it requires analyzing the internal state of the system, which leads to considerable implementation complexities. Second, in order to simulate realistic settings, a new instance of the solver needs to be run for each initial condition. Running a new solver for each initial condition not only significantly increases the computational complexity, but also disregards the underlying relationship between similar initial conditions. We provide a solution to both problems by employing a recurrent neural network that takes a set of initial conditions from a continuous space as input. This approach enables robust and efficient detection of failures because the solution generalizes across the entire space of initial conditions. By simulating an instance where an autonomous car drives while a pedestrian is crossing a road, we demonstrate the solver is now capable of finding solutions for problems that would have previously been intractable.",0
"Abstract: In simulations used to validate autonomous systems, it can often be challenging to determine whether the system has been fully tested against all possible failure scenarios. One approach that has gained traction is adaptive stress testing, where the simulation environment is adjusted over time based on feedback from the autonomous system itself. This helps ensure that the system is pushed beyond its expected capabilities and reveals any potential weaknesses. However, implementing effective adaptive stress testing methods remains an open research problem. We propose a new methodology for efficient autonomy validation using adaptive stress testing that leverages recent advances in machine learning and computer vision. Our approach allows us to identify and prioritize which parameters to perturb in order to more efficiently expose flaws in the autonomy’s decision making process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments conducted on a simulated autonomous ground vehicle navigating in diverse environments. Results show improved coverage of critical failures compared to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our work represents an important step towards improving the safety and reliability of autonomous systems by providing a robust framework for validating their behavior under adverse conditions.",1
On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have high sample complexity while off-policy algorithms are difficult to tune. Merging the two holds the promise to develop efficient algorithms that generalize across diverse environments. It is however challenging in practice to find suitable hyper-parameters that govern this trade off. This paper develops a simple algorithm named P3O that interleaves off-policy updates with on-policy updates. P3O uses the effective sample size between the behavior policy and the target policy to control how far they can be from each other and does not introduce any additional hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments on the Atari-2600 and MuJoCo benchmark suites show that this simple technique is effective in reducing the sample complexity of state-of-the-art algorithms. Code to reproduce experiments in this paper is at https://github.com/rasoolfa/P3O.,0
"Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing new techniques for optimizing policy-based systems in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). One promising approach that has emerged in this area is known as ""policy-on policy optimization"" (PPO), which involves training multiple policies concurrently and using these models to guide the search for better solutions. However, existing studies on PPO have focused primarily on its application in reinforcement learning tasks, while few investigations have explored its potential use in other domains such as supervised and unsupervised learning. To address this gap, our study proposes a novel framework called ""Policy-on Policy-Off Policy Optimization"" (P3O) that combines both on-policy and off-policy methods within a single algorithmic architecture. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional approaches across a range of benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness and paving the way for future research on hybrid policy optimization strategies.

"In this paper, we propose a dual memory structure for reinforcement learning algorithms with replay memory. The dual memory consists of a main memory that stores various data and a cache memory that manages the data and trains the reinforcement learning agent efficiently. Experimental results show that the dual memory structure achieves higher training and test scores than the conventional single memory structure in three selected environments of OpenAI Gym. This implies that the dual memory structure enables better and more efficient training than the single memory structure.",0
"This paper proposes a dual memory structure for efficient use of replay memory in deep reinforcement learning (RL). The primary goal is to balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation by using two separate memories: a small, recent experience buffer and a larger, randomized cache. We show that our approach improves sample efficiency and leads to better overall performance on challenging continuous control tasks compared to existing methods. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis which validates key components of our method and explains why the proposed design enables more effective RL training. Our work provides new insights into how to most effectively utilize replay memories in deep RL algorithms.",1
"We study two time-scale linear stochastic approximation algorithms, which can be used to model well-known reinforcement learning algorithms such as GTD, GTD2, and TDC. We present finite-time performance bounds for the case where the learning rate is fixed. The key idea in obtaining these bounds is to use a Lyapunov function motivated by singular perturbation theory for linear differential equations. We use the bound to design an adaptive learning rate scheme which significantly improves the convergence rate over the known optimal polynomial decay rule in our experiments, and can be used to potentially improve the performance of any other schedule where the learning rate is changed at pre-determined time instants.",0
"This paper addresses two key challenges that arise when applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods to real-world control problems: finite-time performance guarantees and adaptive choice of learning rates. We consider DRL algorithms for problems where there may exist multiple time scales in the system dynamics, motivating separate actor updates for different components of policy parameters based on their associated timescales. We prove new bounds guaranteeing near-optimal performance within a given finite time horizon, under mild technical assumptions similar to prior results but allowing for diverse timescales in system evolutions; these allow us to specialize our adaptation choices for each scale component. We then develop novel adaptation rules tuned per timescale using simple estimates from the solution mapping behavior for linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems; these rely crucially on recent connections established between model-free DRL update equations for LQR and gradient descent for certain infinite-horizon optimal control problems. Finally, we demonstrate via simulation experiments with systems having various complexity properties that our combined algorithm can indeed achieve high rewards in significantly less time than alternative methods while maintaining stability certificates enforced by appropriate Lyapunov functions. Our work provides initial steps towards developing practical DRL controllers able to guarantee desired behavior across a broad range of problem classes.  This research paper explores the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods for controlling complex, multi-timescale systems. By acknowledging the existence of distinct time scales in the system dynamics, the authors propose separating actor updates into corresponding components, enabling finer-grained optimization for better overall control. The paper presents rigorous finite-ti",1
"In this paper, we investigate the problem of overfitting in deep reinforcement learning. Among the most common benchmarks in RL, it is customary to use the same environments for both training and testing. This practice offers relatively little insight into an agent's ability to generalize. We address this issue by using procedurally generated environments to construct distinct training and test sets. Most notably, we introduce a new environment called CoinRun, designed as a benchmark for generalization in RL. Using CoinRun, we find that agents overfit to surprisingly large training sets. We then show that deeper convolutional architectures improve generalization, as do methods traditionally found in supervised learning, including L2 regularization, dropout, data augmentation and batch normalization.",0
"""In this study, we aim to quantify generalization in reinforcement learning by analyzing agents trained on multiple tasks. Generalization refers to an agent’s ability to perform well on previously unseen tasks based on experiences gained from similar training tasks. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the art RL algorithms using common benchmark environments like Atari games and MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our results show that while all algorithms can achieve some degree of generalization, there remains significant variability in their abilities to adapt to new tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals interesting patterns in how different architectures and regularizations methods impact generalization capabilities.

"Despite the empirical success of the actor-critic algorithm, its theoretical understanding lags behind. In a broader context, actor-critic can be viewed as an online alternating update algorithm for bilevel optimization, whose convergence is known to be fragile. To understand the instability of actor-critic, we focus on its application to linear quadratic regulators, a simple yet fundamental setting of reinforcement learning. We establish a nonasymptotic convergence analysis of actor-critic in this setting. In particular, we prove that actor-critic finds a globally optimal pair of actor (policy) and critic (action-value function) at a linear rate of convergence. Our analysis may serve as a preliminary step towards a complete theoretical understanding of bilevel optimization with nonconvex subproblems, which is NP-hard in the worst case and is often solved using heuristics.",0
"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the global convergence properties of actor-critic algorithms. In particular, we focus on the case where the cost function is quadratic and ergodic, which encompasses many relevant applications. Our key contribution is a new proof technique that shows how actor-critics can achieve global convergence under mild assumptions on the problem structure and algorithm parameters. Our approach leverages tools from stochastic approximation theory and differential geometry to establish convergence results for both deterministic and randomized policy updates. We provide extensive experimental evidence that demonstrates our theoretical findings apply broadly across different problems and architectures. Overall, our work provides important insights into the behavior of actor-critic methods, helping practitioners design more efficient RL systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning aims at searching the best policy model for decision making, and has been shown powerful for sequential recommendations. The training of the policy by reinforcement learning, however, is placed in an environment. In many real-world applications, however, the policy training in the real environment can cause an unbearable cost, due to the exploration in the environment. Environment reconstruction from the past data is thus an appealing way to release the power of reinforcement learning in these applications. The reconstruction of the environment is, basically, to extract the casual effect model from the data. However, real-world applications are often too complex to offer fully observable environment information. Therefore, quite possibly there are unobserved confounding variables lying behind the data. The hidden confounder can obstruct an effective reconstruction of the environment. In this paper, by treating the hidden confounder as a hidden policy, we propose a deconfounded multi-agent environment reconstruction (DEMER) approach in order to learn the environment together with the hidden confounder. DEMER adopts a multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning framework. It proposes to introduce the confounder embedded policy, and use the compatible discriminator for training the policies. We then apply DEMER in an application of driver program recommendation. We firstly use an artificial driver program recommendation environment, abstracted from the real application, to verify and analyze the effectiveness of DEMER. We then test DEMER in the real application of Didi Chuxing. Experiment results show that DEMER can effectively reconstruct the hidden confounder, and thus can build the environment better. DEMER also derives a recommendation policy with a significantly improved performance in the test phase of the real application.",0
"This will provide background on why we think this problem might exist, including some real world examples where such hidden confounding variables can affect RL recommendations. We will then discuss related work that has been done on learning from biased feedback and robustness in counterfactual reasoning models as motivating examples of similar problems in different domains. The next part describes our approach. Our first step was to develop an intuition pump, which you have provided by describing an example application: suppose we want to make recommendations using reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning in settings like bandits, simulation, or control systems. Then we describe our approach in more detail. Our method first learns a mapping of each state to an unknown latent representation of its potential outcomes conditioned on all possible actions. Next we take two such mappings (one for the given context C_curr and one for another hypothetical context C_alt), and show they differ only according to how their corresponding sets of action induce perturbations onto the latent space. If these differences match known patterns of confounding relationships among states, we say they may indicate hidden confounding due to those factors; if they do not match any known pattern, it could still just mean other unobserved relationships. We test this idea by comparing to ground truth cases where either C_alt = null or there are no hidden confounding variables in play at all.",1
"We aim to conduct a systematic mapping in the area of testing ML programs. We identify, analyze and classify the existing literature to provide an overview of the area. We followed well-established guidelines of systematic mapping to develop a systematic protocol to identify and review the existing literature. We formulate three sets of research questions, define inclusion and exclusion criteria and systematically identify themes for the classification of existing techniques. We also report the quality of the published works using established assessment criteria. we finally selected 37 papers out of 1654 based on our selection criteria up to January 2019. We analyze trends such as contribution facet, research facet, test approach, type of ML and the kind of testing with several other attributes. We also discuss the empirical evidence and reporting quality of selected papers. The data from the study is made publicly available for other researchers and practitioners. We present an overview of the area by answering several research questions. The area is growing rapidly, however, there is lack of enough empirical evidence to compare and assess the effectiveness of the techniques. More publicly available tools are required for use of practitioners and researchers. Further attention is needed on non-functional testing and testing of ML programs using reinforcement learning. We believe that this study can help researchers and practitioners to obtain an overview of the area and identify several sub-areas where more research is required",0
"This systematic mapping study aimed to provide insights into the current state of research and practices related to testing machine learning programs. We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature from multiple sources using keywords related to testing and machine learning. Our results reveal that while there has been growing interest in this area, existing research primarily focuses on individual testing techniques rather than integrated testing approaches. Furthermore, our analysis suggests a need for more studies that address critical challenges such as scalability, adaptiveness, explainability, fairness, and ethical considerations. Finally, we identified promising future directions for advancing testing methods for machine learning programs, including the use of human feedback, continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines, and model interpretability metrics. Overall, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in testing machine learning systems and can inform the development of new strategies for improving their quality and reliability.",1
"While model-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for sample efficiency and generalization, learning an accurate dynamics model is often challenging and requires substantial interaction with the environment. A wide variety of domains have dynamics that share common foundations like the laws of classical mechanics, which are rarely exploited by existing algorithms. In fact, humans continuously acquire and use such dynamics priors to easily adapt to operating in new environments. In this work, we propose an approach to learn task-agnostic dynamics priors from videos and incorporate them into an RL agent. Our method involves pre-training a frame predictor on task-agnostic physics videos to initialize dynamics models (and fine-tune them) for unseen target environments. Our frame prediction architecture, SpatialNet, is designed specifically to capture localized physical phenomena and interactions. Our approach allows for both faster policy learning and convergence to better policies, outperforming competitive approaches on several different environments. We also demonstrate that incorporating this prior allows for more effective transfer between environments.",0
In Task-agnostic Dynamics Priors for Deep Reinforcement Learning we introduce deep prior distributions over physics-based dynamics models that can improve data efficiency in reinforcement learning by reducing the number of interactions required to learn robust policies across different environments. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the Hopper and Walker2d locomotion tasks using less than half the amount of real-world interactions previously reported. Our framework provides an alternative direction for improving sample complexity in deep RL beyond traditional methods such as curiosity-driven exploration or adding noise.,1
"Batch Reinforcement Learning (Batch RL) consists in training a policy using trajectories collected with another policy, called the behavioural policy. Safe policy improvement (SPI) provides guarantees with high probability that the trained policy performs better than the behavioural policy, also called baseline in this setting. Previous work shows that the SPI objective improves mean performance as compared to using the basic RL objective, which boils down to solving the MDP with maximum likelihood. Here, we build on that work and improve more precisely the SPI with Baseline Bootstrapping algorithm (SPIBB) by allowing the policy search over a wider set of policies. Instead of binarily classifying the state-action pairs into two sets (the \textit{uncertain} and the \textit{safe-to-train-on} ones), we adopt a softer strategy that controls the error in the value estimates by constraining the policy change according to the local model uncertainty. The method can take more risks on uncertain actions all the while remaining provably-safe, and is therefore less conservative than the state-of-the-art methods. We propose two algorithms (one optimal and one approximate) to solve this constrained optimization problem and empirically show a significant improvement over existing SPI algorithms both on finite MDPs and on infinite MDPs with a neural network function approximation.",0
"Soft baselines have emerged as a powerful tool for training agents that achieve high rewards while satisfying constraints on their behavior. However, directly applying these methods to improve safety policies can lead to unsafe behaviors. In our work, we propose a safe policy improvement method using soft baseline bootstrapping (SPIBS), which mitigates this risk by providing strong but verifiable guarantees on the resulting improvement. Our approach proceeds in two steps: first, we generate candidate improvement policies based on the current soft baseline; then, we evaluate each candidate and select only those whose improvements on test cases pass additional strong safety checks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPIBS through experiments on several benchmark environments with diverse requirements and complex reward structures. Our results show that SPIBS significantly improves policies without violating safety constraints and outperforms existing techniques. Overall, SPIBS provides a scalable and principled framework for safely advancing AI systems under constrained settings.",1
"Reinforcement learning usually makes use of numerical rewards, which have nice properties but also come with drawbacks and difficulties. Using rewards on an ordinal scale (ordinal rewards) is an alternative to numerical rewards that has received more attention in recent years. In this paper, a general approach to adapting reinforcement learning problems to the use of ordinal rewards is presented and motivated. We show how to convert common reinforcement learning algorithms to an ordinal variation by the example of Q-learning and introduce Ordinal Deep Q-Networks, which adapt deep reinforcement learning to ordinal rewards. Additionally, we run evaluations on problems provided by the OpenAI Gym framework, showing that our ordinal variants exhibit a performance that is comparable to the numerical variations for a number of problems. We also give first evidence that our ordinal variant is able to produce better results for problems with less engineered and simpler-to-design reward signals.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to reinforcement learning that utilizes ordinal optimization techniques to achieve better performance on complex tasks. We propose a new algorithm called ""Deep Ordinal Reinforcement Learning"" (DORL), which combines deep neural networks with ordinal regression methods to learn optimal policies directly from raw state observations. Our method explicitly models the relative importance of states and actions using pairwise comparisons, allowing for more expressive value functions than traditional RL algorithms. In our experiments, we demonstrate DORL's ability to outperform previous approaches on challenging control problems, including both continuous and discrete action spaces. We believe that DORL represents a significant advancement in the field of RL and offers promising applications across diverse domains.",1
"In multi-task reinforcement learning there are two main challenges: at training time, the ability to learn different policies with a single model; at test time, inferring which of those policies applying without an external signal. In the case of continual reinforcement learning a third challenge arises: learning tasks sequentially without forgetting the previous ones. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing DisCoRL, an approach combining state representation learning and policy distillation. We experiment on a sequence of three simulated 2D navigation tasks with a 3 wheel omni-directional robot. Moreover, we tested our approach's robustness by transferring the final policy into a real life setting. The policy can solve all tasks and automatically infer which one to run.",0
"In recent years, continual learning has become an increasingly important area of research in artificial intelligence, as it allows agents to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned skills. One popular approach to continual learning is reinforcement learning (RL), which involves training agents to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. However, existing RL algorithms often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where they quickly forget previously learned skills when faced with new tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called DisCoRL, which stands for distilled continuous RL. Our method uses policy distillation, a technique that transfers knowledge from one task to another, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable agents to learn multiple tasks simultaneously. We evaluate our method on several benchmark problems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both sample efficiency and overall performance. Overall, our work represents an important step towards creating more intelligent and adaptive agents that can learn and retain knowledge over time.",1
"We propose a policy improvement algorithm for Reinforcement Learning (RL) which is called Rerouted Behavior Improvement (RBI). RBI is designed to take into account the evaluation errors of the Q-function. Such errors are common in RL when learning the $Q$-value from finite past experience data. Greedy policies or even constrained policy optimization algorithms which ignore these errors may suffer from an improvement penalty (i.e. a negative policy improvement). To minimize the improvement penalty, the RBI idea is to attenuate rapid policy changes of low probability actions which were less frequently sampled. This approach is shown to avoid catastrophic performance degradation and reduce regret when learning from a batch of past experience. Through a two-armed bandit with Gaussian distributed rewards example, we show that it also increases data efficiency when the optimal action has a high variance. We evaluate RBI in two tasks in the Atari Learning Environment: (1) learning from observations of multiple behavior policies and (2) iterative RL. Our results demonstrate the advantage of RBI over greedy policies and other constrained policy optimization algorithms as a safe learning approach and as a general data efficient learning algorithm. An anonymous Github repository of our RBI implementation is found at https://github.com/eladsar/rbi.",0
"""Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for decision making under uncertainty. However, safe and efficient RL remains a challenging task due to the high sample complexity of standard RL algorithms, which may lead to slow convergence rates and poor performance in complex environments.

Our approach uses a novel formulation based on optimality equations and Lagrangian relaxation techniques to improve the efficiency and stability of RL algorithms. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that CPI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of domains and problem types, achieving higher cumulative rewards and better satisfaction of safety constraints.

"In recent years there has been significant progress in developing deep learning models that can learn to solve complex tasks from large amounts of data. However, these models often suffer from interpretability problems as they lack transparency into how their predictions are generated. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are capable of solving sequential decision making problems without requiring vast amounts of data or prior knowledge. They achieve this by iteratively taking actions and observing feedback in terms of rewards and penalties until convergence to optimal behaviour. While RL is promising for applications such as robotics and autonomous driving, current formulations have limited interpretability due to black box function approximation methods used in policy evaluation. This work addresses these issues by proposing interpretable dynamics models for use within model-free RL frameworks. We showcase three main contributions: firstly, we propose a method for fitting nonlinear dynamical systems from raw sensor observations which results in physically meaningful, interpretable models capturing time-varying properties of real world phenomena. Secondly, instead of using function approximators such as neural networks to represent both the value functions required to evaluate policies and predict future expected returns, our approach utilizes simple linear combinations of basis functions allowing for greater insight into what drives predicted outcomes. Lastly, we provide theoretical analysis of the relationship between classical system identification objectives and our proposed algorithmic framework demonstrating the validity of our approach. Our findings lead to enhanced understanding of underlying system behavior through clear visualizations and furthermore reduce computational complexity compared to traditional simulation methods since state estimation and prediction is now performed implicitly through learned dynamics models. We demonstrate effectiveness across multiple simulation environments including cartpole balance control, acrobot swingup, hopper locomotion and Lunar Lander where high score benchmarks match those achieved by SOTA RL algorithms despite utilizing significantly less training time. Future directions could potentially integrate our interpretable dynamic models wi",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved significant breakthroughs in various tasks. However, most DRL algorithms suffer a problem of generalizing the learned policy which makes the learning performance largely affected even by minor modifications of the training environment. Except that, the use of deep neural networks makes the learned policies hard to be interpretable. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel algorithm named Neural Logic Reinforcement Learning (NLRL) to represent the policies in reinforcement learning by first-order logic. NLRL is based on policy gradient methods and differentiable inductive logic programming that have demonstrated significant advantages in terms of interpretability and generalisability in supervised tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on cliff-walking and blocks manipulation tasks demonstrate that NLRL can induce interpretable policies achieving near-optimal performance while demonstrating good generalisability to environments of different initial states and problem sizes.",0

"Recommendation problems with large numbers of discrete items, such as products, webpages, or videos, are ubiquitous in the technology industry. Deep neural networks are being increasingly used for these recommendation problems. These models use embeddings to represent discrete items as continuous vectors, and the vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions, although heavily influence the model's accuracy, are often manually selected in a heuristical manner. We present Neural Input Search (NIS), a technique for learning the optimal vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions for categorical features. The goal is to maximize prediction accuracy subject to a constraint on the total memory used by all embeddings. Moreover, we argue that the traditional Single-size Embedding (SE), which uses the same embedding dimension for all values of a feature, suffers from inefficient usage of model capacity and training data. We propose a novel type of embedding, namely Multi-size Embedding (ME), which allows the embedding dimension to vary for different values of the feature. During training we use reinforcement learning to find the optimal vocabulary size for each feature and embedding dimension for each value of the feature. In experiments on two common types of large scale recommendation problems, i.e. retrieval and ranking problems, NIS automatically found better vocabulary and embedding sizes that result in $6.8\%$ and $1.8\%$ relative improvements on Recall@1 and ROC-AUC over manually optimized ones.",0

"Variance plays a crucial role in risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, and most risk measures can be analyzed via variance. In this paper, we consider two law-invariant risks as examples: mean-variance risk and exponential utility risk. With the aid of the state-augmentation transformation (SAT), we show that, the two risks can be estimated in Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a stochastic transition-based reward and a randomized policy. To relieve the enlarged state space, a novel definition of isotopic states is proposed for state lumping, considering the special structure of the transformed transition probability. In the numerical experiment, we illustrate state lumping in the SAT, errors from a naive reward simplification, and the validity of the SAT for the two risk estimations.",0

"We introduce NoisyNet, a deep reinforcement learning agent with parametric noise added to its weights, and show that the induced stochasticity of the agent's policy can be used to aid efficient exploration. The parameters of the noise are learned with gradient descent along with the remaining network weights. NoisyNet is straightforward to implement and adds little computational overhead. We find that replacing the conventional exploration heuristics for A3C, DQN and dueling agents (entropy reward and $\epsilon$-greedy respectively) with NoisyNet yields substantially higher scores for a wide range of Atari games, in some cases advancing the agent from sub to super-human performance.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, transforming many aspects of our lives. One crucial component of modern AI systems is exploration - the process of actively gathering data that may be relevant to solving a particular problem.

"A critical flaw of existing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods is their inability to significantly outperform the demonstrator. This is because IRL typically seeks a reward function that makes the demonstrator appear near-optimal, rather than inferring the underlying intentions of the demonstrator that may have been poorly executed in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel reward-learning-from-observation algorithm, Trajectory-ranked Reward EXtrapolation (T-REX), that extrapolates beyond a set of (approximately) ranked demonstrations in order to infer high-quality reward functions from a set of potentially poor demonstrations. When combined with deep reinforcement learning, T-REX outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning and IRL methods on multiple Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks and achieves performance that is often more than twice the performance of the best demonstration. We also demonstrate that T-REX is robust to ranking noise and can accurately extrapolate intention by simply watching a learner noisily improve at a task over time.",0
"In this paper we propose a new methodology called XBSD that extends inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) beyond suboptimal demonstrations by leveraging observations of human behavior along with natural language instructions. The traditional approach to IRL involves observing expert demonstrations of optimal behavior which can be difficult or impossible to obtain.

By incorporating these additional cues into our model we were able to develop a more accurate representation of user intent allowing us to learn from real world examples without requiring perfect actions. We demonstrate XBSD on several benchmark tasks showing significant improvements over previous methods that rely solely on demonstration data. Our results have important implications for developing intelligent assistants capable of understanding diverse human behaviors through multi modal inputs such as textual queries and observed actions.",1
"Active Inference is a theory of action arising from neuroscience which casts action and planning as a bayesian inference problem to be solved by minimizing a single quantity - the variational free energy. Active Inference promises a unifying account of action and perception coupled with a biologically plausible process theory.

In this paper we propose a novel deep Active Inference algorithm which approximates key densities using deep neural networks as flexible function approximators, which enables Active Inference to scale to significantly larger and more complex tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a suite of OpenAIGym benchmark tasks and obtain performance comparable with common reinforcement learning baselines. Moreover, our algorithm shows similarities with maximum entropy reinforcement learning and the policy gradients algorithm, which reveals interesting connections between the Active Inference framework and reinforcement learning.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in recent years due to advancements in deep learning and machine vision techniques. However, traditional models often rely on static, predefined policies that may not adapt well to changes in the environment or unexpected situations. As such, there remains a need for more flexible and dynamic approaches to policy optimization.  In response to this challenge, we propose a new framework called ""Deep Active Inference"" (DAI) which integrates variational inference and policy gradient methods into a single coherent model. Our approach leverages principles from active inference theory, which posits that organisms actively create internal representations of their environments through perception and action cycles. By adopting similar principles in our neural architecture, DAI can dynamically update its beliefs and goals based on sensor feedback, resulting in robust, adaptive behavior under uncertainty.  To enable efficient exploration in complex high-dimensional spaces, our method relies on stochastic actor-critic reinforcement learning with latent variable models. We use Monte Carlo sampling techniques to approximate the posterior distributions over latent variables representing both state features and task parameters. This allows us to learn low-dimensional latent dynamics underlying raw sensory observations, enabling scalability and interpretability.  We evaluate DAI across a range of challenging tasks, including both discrete actions and continuous control problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baseline methods on most benchmark domains while maintaining comparable performance in others. Furthermore, we analyze the learned latent space representations to gain insights into how DAI generates behaviors.

"Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems are not able to learn effectively from off-policy data, especially if they cannot explore online in the environment. These are critical shortcomings for applying RL to real-world problems where collecting data is expensive, and models must be tested offline before being deployed to interact with the environment -- e.g. systems that learn from human interaction. Thus, we develop a novel class of off-policy batch RL algorithms, which are able to effectively learn offline, without exploring, from a fixed batch of human interaction data. We leverage models pre-trained on data as a strong prior, and use KL-control to penalize divergence from this prior during RL training. We also use dropout-based uncertainty estimates to lower bound the target Q-values as a more efficient alternative to Double Q-Learning. The algorithms are tested on the problem of open-domain dialog generation -- a challenging reinforcement learning problem with a 20,000-dimensional action space. Using our Way Off-Policy algorithm, we can extract multiple different reward functions post-hoc from collected human interaction data, and learn effectively from all of these. We test the real-world generalization of these systems by deploying them live to converse with humans in an open-domain setting, and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves significant improvements over prior methods in off-policy batch RL.",0

In this paper, we propose a new class of algorithms, called Robust Blackbox Optimization (RBO). Remarkably, even if up to $23\%$ of all the measurements are arbitrarily corrupted, RBO can provably recover gradients to high accuracy. RBO relies on learning gradient flows using robust regression methods to enable off-policy updates. On several MuJoCo robot control tasks, when all other RL approaches collapse in the presence of adversarial noise, RBO is able to train policies effectively.

"At an early age, human infants are able to learn and build a model of the world very quickly by constantly observing and interacting with objects around them. One of the most fundamental intuitions human infants acquire is intuitive physics. Human infants learn and develop these models, which later serve as prior knowledge for further learning.

Experimental evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms synchronous versions of advantage actor critic (AAC) on several metrics, including score attained during training episodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our framework through successful transfer learning from simulated environments to real-world hardware using a custom-built physical replica of Flappy Bird. Our work represents a major step towards developing efficient and effective methods for controlling agents in complex game domains, paving the way for achieving human-level performance in a broader range of applications beyond gaming.",1
This paper considers a distributed reinforcement learning problem in which a network of multiple agents aim to cooperatively maximize the globally averaged return through communication with only local neighbors. A randomized communication-efficient multi-agent actor-critic algorithm is proposed for possibly unidirectional communication relationships depicted by a directed graph. It is shown that the algorithm can solve the problem for strongly connected graphs by allowing each agent to transmit only two scalar-valued variables at one time.,0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that can handle large state spaces and long time horizons, particularly those based on deep neural networks. However, many existing methods face two major challenges: scalability and communication efficiency. On one hand, decentralized methods such as independent Q-learning often suffer from slow convergence due to the lack of global information sharing. On the other hand, centralized methods such as value iteration and policy gradient require frequent communication among agents, which becomes impractical for large systems. This work proposes a novel actor-critic algorithm called “COMA” that addresses these issues by balancing global information sharing and local decision making. COMA adopts a hybrid architecture consisting of centralized critics and decentralized actors, where each agent uses its own local critic network to evaluate the current joint action and select actions independently without explicit communication. The main contributions of this work are threefold. Firstly, we develop a new multi-step centralized training procedure using weighted bootstrapping to improve the quality of shared global information while reducing unnecessary communication overhead. Secondly, we design a doubly stochastic softmax function that allows efficient parallel computation while preserving accuracy compared to standard cross entropy approximations used in previous works. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of COMA across a wide range of gridworld domains featuring both centralized rewards and nonlinear functions, further validating the proposed methodology for distributed RL applications. While there is still plenty more room for improvement in terms of sample complexity and stability given specific task requirements, our findings present a meaningful step forward towards achieving reliable solutions f",1
"Imitation Learning (IL) is a machine learning approach to learn a policy from a dataset of demonstrations. IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single ""average"" policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to perform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors. Additionally, by applying the UCB1 algorithm, we are able to adapt the behavior of the policy - in-between games - to reach a performance beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach.",0
"In this paper we propose a model that uses demonstration to learn and replicate human behaviors in virtual environments. Our method builds on previous work which has shown the potential utility of learning by example. We have demonstrated our approach using both real world data and synthetic simulations. In particular, we show how our learned behavior can outperform other models that rely solely on hand engineered rules. Finally, we discuss several promising future directions for this research including more advanced techniques such as generative adversarial networks, imitation learning, and hierarchical task decomposition. Overall, we believe this paper represents a significant step towards developing intelligent agents capable of interacting with humans in complex and dynamic environments.",1
"Temporal difference methods enable efficient estimation of value functions in reinforcement learning in an incremental fashion, and are of broader interest because they correspond learning as observed in biological systems. Standard value functions correspond to the expected value of a sum of discounted returns. While this formulation is often sufficient for many purposes, it would often be useful to be able to represent functions of the return as well. Unfortunately, most such functions cannot be estimated directly using TD methods. We propose a means of estimating functions of the return using its moments, which can be learned online using a modified TD algorithm. The moments of the return are then used as part of a Taylor expansion to approximate analytic functions of the return.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning functions that return values based on input data. Our approach builds upon previous work by incrementally updating the function over time as new examples become available. We show how our method can effectively learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs using only simple training data. Additionally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through experiments across multiple domains and evaluate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art methods. Overall, we believe our work contributes towards building more powerful machine learning systems able to handle challenging tasks under limited supervision.",1
"This paper targets the problem of image set-based face verification and identification. Unlike traditional single media (an image or video) setting, we encounter a set of heterogeneous contents containing orderless images and videos. The importance of each image is usually considered either equal or based on their independent quality assessment. How to model the relationship of orderless images within a set remains a challenge. We address this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the latent space. Specifically, we first present a dependency-aware attention control (DAC) network, which resorts to actor-critic reinforcement learning for sequential attention decision of each image embedding to fully exploit the rich correlation cues among the unordered images. Moreover, we introduce its sample-efficient variant with off-policy experience replay to speed up the learning process. The pose-guided representation scheme can further boost the performance at the extremes of the pose variation.",0
"This paper presents a novel unsupervised approach to face recognition that uses attention mechanisms guided by dependencies among image features. Our method builds upon previous work on attention control in deep learning models but departs from the prevailing focus on controlling the selectivity of individual units and instead controls which regions in input images drive feature extraction. By modeling interdependencies among local patterns we improve the robustness to variations in lightning conditions, pose and expression and achieve state of the art results across multiple benchmarks datasets including MegaFace Challenge and IJB-C dataset. We further show that our framework can also leverage additional modalities such as audio recordings which could potentially enhance performance even more. In conclusion the proposed method sets new standards for accuracy of face recognition under uncontrolled acquisition scenarios and paves the road towards applications on real world problems where scalability is crucial, e.g., smart cities or IoT devices.",1
"Composing previously mastered skills to solve novel tasks promises dramatic improvements in the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. Here, we analyze two recent works composing behaviors represented in the form of action-value functions and show that they perform poorly in some situations. As part of this analysis, we extend an important generalization of policy improvement to the maximum entropy framework and introduce an algorithm for the practical implementation of successor features in continuous action spaces. Then we propose a novel approach which addresses the failure cases of prior work and, in principle, recovers the optimal policy during transfer. This method works by explicitly learning the (discounted, future) divergence between base policies. We study this approach in the tabular case and on non-trivial continuous control problems with compositional structure and show that it outperforms or matches existing methods across all tasks considered.",0
"This paper presents a method for compositing entropic policies using divergence correction. By analyzing the underlying behavior and decisions of agents through entropy maximization, we can create effective policies that reduce uncertainty while still maintaining diversity among agent behaviors. We propose a two-step approach: first, we use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine the initial policy distribution; then, we apply convergent correction to minimize the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the estimated distribution and the true distribution. Our experiments show that our proposed method results in more accurate policy representations compared to previous methods such as mean field approximation and importance sampling-based corrections. The use of divergence correction ensures greater stability and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters. Overall, our method offers improved accuracy in entropic policy composition.",1
"Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms contain inductive biases that sculpt the agent's objective and its interface to the environment. These inductive biases can take many forms, including domain knowledge and pretuned hyper-parameters. In general, there is a trade-off between generality and performance when algorithms use such biases. Stronger biases can lead to faster learning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms. This trade-off is important because inductive biases are not free; substantial effort may be required to obtain relevant domain knowledge or to tune hyper-parameters effectively. In this paper, we re-examine several domain-specific components that bias the objective and the environmental interface of common deep reinforcement learning agents. We investigated whether the performance deteriorates when these components are replaced with adaptive solutions from the literature. In our experiments, performance sometimes decreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to components crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components performed better. We investigated the main benefit of having fewer domain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two systems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional tuning of either system. As hypothesized, the system with adaptive components performed better on many of the new tasks.",0
"""In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly popular due to its ability to learn complex behaviors from raw input data without explicit supervision. However, many real-world applications require domain knowledge and prior assumptions encoded into the model, known as inductive biases, to effectively solve problems. In this work, we investigate how different types of inductive biases affect the performance and generalization of RL models on simulated robotics tasks. We propose two novel approaches: incorporating task structure using graph neural networks, and regularizing parameter space through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our experimental results show that both methods significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of RL agents compared to baseline models without such biases, demonstrating the importance of encoding relevant prior knowledge during training.""",1
"Sharing knowledge between tasks is vital for efficient learning in a multi-task setting. However, most research so far has focused on the easier case where knowledge transfer is not harmful, i.e., where knowledge from one task cannot negatively impact the performance on another task. In contrast, we present an approach to multi-task deep reinforcement learning based on attention that does not require any a-priori assumptions about the relationships between tasks. Our attention network automatically groups task knowledge into sub-networks on a state level granularity. It thereby achieves positive knowledge transfer if possible, and avoids negative transfer in cases where tasks interfere. We test our algorithm against two state-of-the-art multi-task/transfer learning approaches and show comparable or superior performance while requiring fewer network parameters.",0

"We adapt the ideas underlying the success of Deep Q-Learning to the continuous action domain. We present an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces. Using the same learning algorithm, network architecture and hyper-parameters, our algorithm robustly solves more than 20 simulated physics tasks, including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving. Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives. We further demonstrate that for many of the tasks the algorithm can learn policies end-to-end: directly from raw pixel inputs.",0
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to excel at solving challenging continuous action problems. However, real world systems often contain constraints on the actions that can be taken which RL algorithms may struggle to satisfy. In addition, previous work in RL lacks explicit consideration of smoothness regularization, which could otherwise reduce overshoot, improve stability, and result in policies more amenable to analysis. This paper proposes two novel extensions: Firstly, we use an entropy penalty term explicitly minimized by the agent during training as a proxy for action penalties, allowing us to directly trade off exploration against constraint satisfaction without having to define them artificially one against the other. Secondly, we propose an additional loss term based on second order finite differences of consecutive policy values; this can then be combined with previously proposed methods for controlling gradient norms at each iteration. We show experimentally that these terms achieve their desired effects both individually and jointly, improving results over state of the art on several benchmark tasks while constraining the agent behavior.",1
"Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is commonly considered to suffer from non-stationary environments and exponentially increasing policy space. It would be even more challenging when rewards are sparse and delayed over long trajectories. In this paper, we study hierarchical deep MARL in cooperative multiagent problems with sparse and delayed reward. With temporal abstraction, we decompose the problem into a hierarchy of different time scales and investigate how agents can learn high-level coordination based on the independent skills learned at the low level. Three hierarchical deep MARL architectures are proposed to learn hierarchical policies under different MARL paradigms. Besides, we propose a new experience replay mechanism to alleviate the issue of the sparse transitions at the high level of abstraction and the non-stationarity of multiagent learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in two domains with extremely sparse feedback: (1) a variety of Multiagent Trash Collection tasks, and (2) a challenging online mobile game, i.e., Fever Basketball Defense.",0
"Abstract: This research explores the use of hierarchical deep multiagent reinforcement learning (HDMARL) with temporal abstraction for improved decision making in complex systems. HDMARL involves multiple agents working together to learn optimal policies through trial-and-error interactions with their environment. By incorporating temporal abstraction, these agents can focus on high-level goals and plan more effectively over longer time horizons. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using simulations and experiments on real-world tasks involving multiple agents collaborating towards common objectives. Our results demonstrate that HDMARL with temporal abstraction significantly improves overall system performance compared to standard MARL algorithms.",1
"Dyna is an architecture for model-based reinforcement learning (RL), where simulated experience from a model is used to update policies or value functions. A key component of Dyna is search-control, the mechanism to generate the state and action from which the agent queries the model, which remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose to generate such states by using the trajectory obtained from Hill Climbing (HC) the current estimate of the value function. This has the effect of propagating value from high-value regions and of preemptively updating value estimates of the regions that the agent is likely to visit next. We derive a noisy projected natural gradient algorithm for hill climbing, and highlight a connection to Langevin dynamics. We provide an empirical demonstration on four classical domains that our algorithm, HC-Dyna, can obtain significant sample efficiency improvements. We study the properties of different sampling distributions for search-control, and find that there appears to be a benefit specifically from using the samples generated by climbing on current value estimates from low-value to high-value region.",0
"This abstract describes research that explores hill climbing as a method for improving value estimates during search control operations using Dyna software. The study investigates how implementing a hill climb algorithm can improve the accuracy and efficiency of value estimation by incrementally updating values based on feedback from previous iterations.

Overall, this work contributes valuable insights into effective decision making under uncertainty and has important applications across multiple domains, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer science.",1
"Despite the remarkable success of Deep RL in learning control policies from raw pixels, the resulting models do not generalize. We demonstrate that a trained agent fails completely when facing small visual changes, and that fine-tuning---the common transfer learning paradigm---fails to adapt to these changes, to the extent that it is faster to re-train the model from scratch. We show that by separating the visual transfer task from the control policy we achieve substantially better sample efficiency and transfer behavior, allowing an agent trained on the source task to transfer well to the target tasks. The visual mapping from the target to the source domain is performed using unaligned GANs, resulting in a control policy that can be further improved using imitation learning from imperfect demonstrations. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic visual variants of the Breakout game, as well as on transfer between subsequent levels of Road Fighter, a Nintendo car-driving game. A visualization of our approach can be seen in https://youtu.be/4mnkzYyXMn4 and https://youtu.be/KCGTrQi6Ogo .",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for transferring knowledge from one reinforcement learning task to another using image-to-image translation.

Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating the learning process for related RL tasks. In addition, we provide detailed ablation studies to investigate the impact of different components in our framework and analyze the generated images to gain insights into how the translation model helps improve RL performance. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of leveraging vision models to facilitate transfer learning in reinforcement learning domains.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is widely seen as having the potential to be significantly more sample efficient than model-free RL. However, research in model-based RL has not been very standardized. It is fairly common for authors to experiment with self-designed environments, and there are several separate lines of research, which are sometimes closed-sourced or not reproducible. Accordingly, it is an open question how these various existing MBRL algorithms perform relative to each other. To facilitate research in MBRL, in this paper we gather a wide collection of MBRL algorithms and propose over 18 benchmarking environments specially designed for MBRL. We benchmark these algorithms with unified problem settings, including noisy environments. Beyond cataloguing performance, we explore and unify the underlying algorithmic differences across MBRL algorithms. We characterize three key research challenges for future MBRL research: the dynamics bottleneck, the planning horizon dilemma, and the early-termination dilemma. Finally, to maximally facilitate future research on MBRL, we open-source our benchmark in http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tingwuwang/mbrl.html.",0

"We study the problem of learning sequential decision-making policies in settings with multiple state-action representations. Such settings naturally arise in many domains, such as planning (e.g., multiple integer programming formulations) and various combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., those with both integer programming and graph-based formulations). Inspired by the classical co-training framework for classification, we study the problem of co-training for policy learning. We present sufficient conditions under which learning from two views can improve upon learning from a single view alone. Motivated by these theoretical insights, we present a meta-algorithm for co-training for sequential decision making. Our framework is compatible with both reinforcement learning and imitation learning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across a wide range of tasks, including discrete/continuous control and combinatorial optimization.",0

"Before deploying autonomous agents in the real world, we need to be confident they will perform safely in novel situations. Ideally, we would expose agents to a very wide range of situations during training, allowing them to learn about every possible danger, but this is often impractical. This paper investigates safety and generalization from a limited number of training environments in deep reinforcement learning (RL). We find RL algorithms can fail dangerously on unseen test environments even when performing perfectly on training environments. Firstly, in a gridworld setting, we show that catastrophes can be significantly reduced with simple modifications, including ensemble model averaging and the use of a blocking classifier. In the more challenging CoinRun environment we find similar methods do not significantly reduce catastrophes. However, we do find that the uncertainty information from the ensemble is useful for predicting whether a catastrophe will occur within a few steps and hence whether human intervention should be requested.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in many applications that require decision making under uncertainty. In RL, agents learn by interacting with their environment through trial and error. However, traditional RL methods suffer from the issue of sample inefficiency, meaning they need large amounts of data to achieve good performance. This becomes more challenging in safety-critical domains where collecting data can be expensive, time-consuming, and even dangerous.  To address this problem, researchers have explored ways to generalize from limited amounts of data. One approach is to use a technique called meta-learning, which allows agents to learn how to learn new tasks quickly. Meta-learning algorithms improve the efficiency of model training by adapting to different task distributions and leveraging prior knowledge learned from previous experiences. Another promising direction is to use multi-task learning, which involves training an agent on multiple related tasks simultaneously. This helps the agent transfer knowledge across tasks and better exploit similarities among them.  In this paper, we propose a method that combines these two approaches - meta-learning and multi-task learning - specifically tailored for safety-critical RL problems. We design a novel algorithm based on gradient-based meta-learning with model-agnostic meta-learners such as MAML and Reptile, coupled with an offline constraint on the maximum risk increase allowed during adaptation. Our proposed framework balances effective adaptation to new tasks while ensuring safe behavior throughout all stages of learning. Experiments conducted on simulated robots demonstrate our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both safety measures and task success rates. Overall, our work offers a scalable solution for real-world deployment of RL systems in high-stakes scenarios.",1
"Training a robotic arm to accomplish real-world tasks has been attracting increasing attention in both academia and industry. This work discusses the role of computer vision algorithms in this field. We focus on low-cost arms on which no sensors are equipped and thus all decisions are made upon visual recognition, e.g., real-time 3D pose estimation. This requires annotating a lot of training data, which is not only time-consuming but also laborious.   In this paper, we present an alternative solution, which uses a 3D model to create a large number of synthetic data, trains a vision model in this virtual domain, and applies it to real-world images after domain adaptation. To this end, we design a semi-supervised approach, which fully leverages the geometric constraints among keypoints. We apply an iterative algorithm for optimization. Without any annotations on real images, our algorithm generalizes well and produces satisfying results on 3D pose estimation, which is evaluated on two real-world datasets. We also construct a vision-based control system for task accomplishment, for which we train a reinforcement learning agent in a virtual environment and apply it to the real-world. Moreover, our approach, with merely a 3D model being required, has the potential to generalize to other types of multi-rigid-body dynamic systems.",0

"There is a growing desire in the field of reinforcement learning (and machine learning in general) to move from black-box models toward more ""interpretable AI."" We improve interpretability of reinforcement learning by increasing the utility of decision tree policies learned via reinforcement learning. These policies consist of a decision tree over the state space, which requires fewer parameters to express than traditional policy representations. Existing methods for creating decision tree policies via reinforcement learning focus on accurately representing an action-value function during training, but this leads to much larger trees than would otherwise be required. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel algorithm which only increases tree size when the estimated discounted future reward of the overall policy would increase by a sufficient amount. Through evaluation in a simulated environment, we show that its performance is comparable or superior to traditional tree-based approaches and that it yields a more succinct policy. Additionally, we discuss tuning parameters to control the tradeoff between optimizing for smaller tree size or for overall reward.",0
"This paper proposes a new method called Conservative Q-improvement (CQ) that extends deep reinforcement learning from linear function approximators to decision trees.

Our results suggest that CQ provides a promising solution to one of the key challenges facing modern machine learning—how to balance interpretability and accuracy. With CQ, we can achieve both high-quality solutions and human-readable explanations, making our approach well-suited for real-world applications where transparency is important.

"Transfer learning across different reinforcement learning (RL) tasks is becoming an increasingly valuable area of research. We consider a goal-based multi-task RL framework and mechanisms by which previously solved tasks can reduce sample complexity and regret when the agent is faced with a new task. Specifically, we introduce two metrics on the state space that encode notions of traversibility of the state space for an agent. Using these metrics a topological covering is constructed by way of a set of landmark states in a fully self-supervised manner. We show that these landmark coverings confer theoretical advantages for transfer learning within the goal-based multi-task RL setting. Specifically, we demonstrate three mechanisms by which landmark coverings can be used for successful transfer learning. First, we extend the Landmark Options Via Reflection (LOVR) framework to this new topological covering; second, we use the landmark-centric value functions themselves as features and define a greedy zombie policy that achieves near oracle performance on a sequence of zero-shot transfer tasks; finally, motivated by the second transfer mechanism, we introduce a learned reward function that provides a more dense reward signal for goal-based RL. Our novel topological landmark covering confers beneficial theoretical results, bounding the Q values at each state-action pair. In doing so, we introduce a mechanism that performs action-pruning at infeasible actions which cannot possibly be part of an optimal policy for the current goal.",0
"Title: Mechanisms for Transfer Using Landmark Value Functions in Multi-Task Lifelong Reinforcement Learning Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing models that can learn from multiple tasks and adapt to new environments quickly. One approach to achieve this goal is through the use of multi-task lifelong reinforcement learning (RL). This field of study focuses on developing algorithms that allow agents to learn from experience across multiple domains, where each domain represents a different task. In order to improve performance in the new task, previous knowledge acquired in other tasks should be transferred to the current one. However, existing approaches often require many iterations before successful adaptation occurs. To overcome these limitations, we propose the use of landmark value functions as a mechanism for efficient transfer across tasks. Our method enables the agent to identify valuable features of the environment and use them to generalize previous experiences into new ones. We show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency and speed of convergence.

"In many real-world scenarios, an autonomous agent often encounters various tasks within a single complex environment. We propose to build a graph abstraction over the environment structure to accelerate the learning of these tasks. Here, nodes are important points of interest (pivotal states) and edges represent feasible traversals between them. Our approach has two stages. First, we jointly train a latent pivotal state model and a curiosity-driven goal-conditioned policy in a task-agnostic manner. Second, provided with the information from the world graph, a high-level Manager quickly finds solution to new tasks and expresses subgoals in reference to pivotal states to a low-level Worker. The Worker can then also leverage the graph to easily traverse to the pivotal states of interest, even across long distance, and explore non-locally. We perform a thorough ablation study to evaluate our approach on a suite of challenging maze tasks, demonstrating significant advantages from the proposed framework over baselines that lack world graph knowledge in terms of performance and efficiency.",0
"This paper proposes an approach to accelerating hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) by using precomputed world graphs. HRL algorithms can be significantly slowed down by having to learn multiple levels of hierarchy at once, but using precomputed world graphs enables efficient computation of value functions at different levels of abstraction.

Our method has implications for real-world applications where fast, scalable learning is required.",1
"We consider the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning and we show that an agent imbued with an epistemic-risk-seeking utility function is able to explore efficiently, as measured by regret. The parameter that controls how risk-seeking the agent is can be optimized to minimize regret, or annealed according to a schedule. We call the resulting algorithm K-learning and we show that the K-values that the agent maintains are optimistic for the expected optimal Q-values at each state-action pair. The utility function approach induces a natural Boltzmann exploration policy for which the 'temperature' parameter is equal to the risk-seeking parameter. This policy achieves a Bayesian regret bound of $\tilde O(L^{3/2} \sqrt{SAT})$, where L is the time horizon, S is the number of states, A is the number of actions, and T is the total number of elapsed time-steps. K-learning can be interpreted as mirror descent in the policy space, and it is similar to other well-known methods in the literature, including Q-learning, soft-Q-learning, and maximum entropy policy gradient. K-learning is simple to implement, as it only requires adding a bonus to the reward at each state-action and then solving a Bellman equation. We conclude with a numerical example demonstrating that K-learning is competitive with other state-of-the-art algorithms in practice.",0
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the development of algorithms that can learn and make decisions in complex environments based on feedback from their environment. One such approach is reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to improve their performance over time by maximizing rewards while minimizing penalties. However, traditional RL approaches suffer from two major limitations: they either require large amounts of data or use simplified models to predict future outcomes. In this paper, we propose a new framework called variational Bayesian regret bounding (VBRC) that addresses these limitations. VBRC uses a probabilistic model to make predictions about future outcomes, allowing agents to take into account uncertainty and risk when making decisions. Our method also provides guarantees on the agent’s performance in terms of cumulative regret, which is the difference between the reward obtained and the optimal reward if all actions were known. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments conducted in simulated environments. Our results show that VBRC significantly reduces regret compared to state-of-the-art methods. This work has important implications for applications where real-time decision-making under uncertainty is essential, such as robotics, healthcare, and finance.",1
"Traditionally, machine learning algorithms rely on the assumption that all features of a given dataset are available for free. However, there are many concerns such as monetary data collection costs, patient discomfort in medical procedures, and privacy impacts of data collection that require careful consideration in any real-world health analytics system. An efficient solution would only acquire a subset of features based on the value it provides while considering acquisition costs. Moreover, datasets that provide feature costs are very limited, especially in healthcare. In this paper, we provide a health dataset as well as a method for assigning feature costs based on the total level of inconvenience asking for each feature entails. Furthermore, based on the suggested dataset, we provide a comparison of recent and state-of-the-art approaches to cost-sensitive feature acquisition and learning.

We study this problem within the formalism of Corrupt Reward Markov Decision Processes (CRMDPs). We show that if the reward corruption in a CRMDP is sufficiently ""spiky"", the environment is solvable. We fully characterize the regret bound of a Spiky CRMDP, and introduce an algorithm that is able to detect its corrupt states.

Finally, we investigate our algorithm in a pair of simple gridworld environments, finding that our algorithm can detect the corrupt states and learn the optimal policy despite the corruption.",0
"Corruption can be defined as actions taken by actors for their private benefit at public expense, leading to the erosion of trust in government institutions. In recent years, there has been increasing concern over corrupt practices in government decision making processes. One such process that has come under scrutiny is the use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which have become popular tools for modeling and solving sequential decision problems in a wide range of domains including healthcare, finance, and transportation. This study investigates the presence of ""spiky"" corruption in MDPs, which refers to situations where small changes in the state of the world lead to large differences in actor payoffs, creating opportunities for rent extraction through manipulation of the environment. We propose a new methodology for detecting spiky corruption in MDPs based on sensitivity analysis of policy decisions to variations in system parameters. Our approach provides insights into the vulnerability of different policies to manipulation by selfish agents and allows for identification of those states and time periods that are most likely to experience corrupted behavior. We illustrate our findings using real-world case studies from the healthcare industry and highlight implications for future research in detecting and preventing spiky corruption in MDPs.",1
"Sequence prediction models can be learned from example sequences with a variety of training algorithms. Maximum likelihood learning is simple and efficient, yet can suffer from compounding error at test time. Reinforcement learning such as policy gradient addresses the issue but can have prohibitively poor exploration efficiency. A rich set of other algorithms such as RAML, SPG, and data noising, have also been developed from different perspectives. This paper establishes a formal connection between these algorithms. We present a generalized entropy regularized policy optimization formulation, and show that the apparently distinct algorithms can all be reformulated as special instances of the framework, with the only difference being the configurations of a reward function and a couple of hyperparameters. The unified interpretation offers a systematic view of the varying properties of exploration and learning efficiency. Besides, inspired from the framework, we present a new algorithm that dynamically interpolates among the family of algorithms for scheduled sequence model learning. Experiments on machine translation, text summarization, and game imitation learning demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.",0
"In recent years, machine learning has seen significant advancements in solving complex problems ranging from computer vision and natural language processing to speech recognition and autonomous driving. One particularly challenging task that remains elusive is sequence prediction, which involves predicting future observations based on past ones. Two popular approaches used to tackle this problem are maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and reinforcement learning (RL). Despite their widespread use, there still exists a gap between these two methods, with each having its own set of advantages and limitations. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by introducing novel methods that combine the strengths of both MLE and RL for sequence prediction tasks. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple domains, including finance, sports, and weather forecasting. Our results showcase the potential impact of connecting the dots between MLE and RL for solving real-world problems related to sequential data analysis and decision making. Overall, we believe this work paves the way towards more efficient and effective solutions in the field of machine learning.",1
"In complex tasks, such as those with large combinatorial action spaces, random exploration may be too inefficient to achieve meaningful learning progress. In this work, we use a curriculum of progressively growing action spaces to accelerate learning. We assume the environment is out of our control, but that the agent may set an internal curriculum by initially restricting its action space. Our approach uses off-policy reinforcement learning to estimate optimal value functions for multiple action spaces simultaneously and efficiently transfers data, value estimates, and state representations from restricted action spaces to the full task. We show the efficacy of our approach in proof-of-concept control tasks and on challenging large-scale StarCraft micromanagement tasks with large, multi-agent action spaces.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents Growing Action Spaces (GAS), a novel method that expands the action space at runtime based on the agent’s performance. Our method addresses the limitations of traditional methods that assume a fixed action space by enabling agents to learn new actions as they improve their understanding of the problem domain. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmark tasks while requiring fewer interactions. Importantly, we show that our algorithm naturally leads to more concise policies, making them easier to interpret and analyze. Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step toward creating agents capable of learning increasingly powerful skills over time.",1
"Temporal point process is an expressive tool for modeling event sequences over time. In this paper, we take a reinforcement learning view whereby the observed sequences are assumed to be generated from a mixture of latent policies. The purpose is to cluster the sequences with different temporal patterns into the underlying policies while learning each of the policy model. The flexibility of our model lies in: i) all the components are networks including the policy network for modeling the intensity function of temporal point process; ii) to handle varying-length event sequences, we resort to inverse reinforcement learning by decomposing the observed sequence into states (RNN hidden embedding of history) and actions (time interval to next event) in order to learn the reward function, thus achieving better performance or increasing efficiency compared to existing methods using rewards over the entire sequence such as log-likelihood or Wasserstein distance. We adopt an expectation-maximization framework with the E-step estimating the cluster labels for each sequence, and the M-step aiming to learn the respective policy. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our method against state-of-the-arts.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach for temporal point processes clustering using reinforcement learning with policy mixture models (PPMs). Existing methods for temporal point process clustering typically rely on handcrafted features and predefined metrics, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the flexibility and adaptiveness of PPMs to learn feature representations directly from raw data. Our method uses Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to optimize a policy that generates clusters by selecting actions based on the current state of the system. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on real datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods. Overall, our work advances the field of time series analysis by providing a powerful tool for discovering meaningful patterns and relationships in complex temporal systems.",1
"A simple, flexible approach to creating expressive priors in Gaussian process (GP) models makes new kernels from a combination of basic kernels, e.g. summing a periodic and linear kernel can capture seasonal variation with a long term trend. Despite a well-studied link between GPs and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), the BNN analogue of this has not yet been explored. This paper derives BNN architectures mirroring such kernel combinations. Furthermore, it shows how BNNs can produce periodic kernels, which are often useful in this context. These ideas provide a principled approach to designing BNNs that incorporate prior knowledge about a function. We showcase the practical value of these ideas with illustrative experiments in supervised and reinforcement learning settings.",0

We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, showing that expressive priors can significantly enhance the capabilities of existing Bayesian models. Our results highlight the potential impact of these methods on fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. Overall, this work contributes new techniques for improving state-of-the-art probabilistic inference algorithms by leveraging richer prior assumptions.",1
"The security of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) algorithms deployed in real life applications are of a primary concern. In particular, the robustness of RL agents in cyber-physical systems against adversarial attacks are especially vital since the cost of a malevolent intrusions can be extremely high. Studies have shown Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which forms the core decision-making unit in most modern RL algorithms, are easily subjected to adversarial attacks. Hence, it is imperative that RL agents deployed in real-life applications have the capability to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks in an online fashion. An example of such a framework is the Meta-Learned Advantage Hierarchy (MLAH) agent that utilizes a meta-learning framework to learn policies robustly online. Since the mechanism of this framework are still not fully explored, we conducted multiple experiments to better understand the framework's capabilities and limitations. Our results shows that the MLAH agent exhibits interesting coping behaviors when subjected to different adversarial attacks to maintain a nominal reward. Additionally, the framework exhibits a hierarchical coping capability, based on the adaptability of the Master policy and sub-policies themselves. From empirical results, we also observed that as the interval of adversarial attacks increase, the MLAH agent can maintain a higher distribution of rewards, though at the cost of higher instabilities.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making rapid advancements in recent years, resulting in significant improvements in applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. However, these impressive accomplishments have brought attention to new vulnerabilities that arise from overreliance on AI systems. One major threat that concerns researchers and practitioners alike is adversarial attacks—malicious input designed to exploit weaknesses in AI algorithms and cause failures or deceptions. These attacks can compromise the integrity and reliability of AI models, leading to severe consequences in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and national security. Therefore, addressing adversarial attacks is crucial for ensuring safe and reliable operation of AI systems in real-world settings. This paper presents an extensive survey of existing work in learning to cope with adversarial attacks. We aim to provide an inclusive view of current approaches and identify open challenges facing this rapidly growing field. Our study covers several key aspects including attack types, defense mechanisms, evaluation metrics, and future directions. By synthesizing the latest developments and identifying knowledge gaps, we hope our work contributes to advancing the understanding and development of robust AI solutions against adversarial attacks.",1
"Advances in renewable energy generation and introduction of the government targets to improve energy efficiency gave rise to a concept of a Zero Energy Building (ZEB). A ZEB is a building whose net energy usage over a year is zero, i.e., its energy use is not larger than its overall renewables generation. A collection of ZEBs forms a Zero Energy Community (ZEC). This paper addresses the problem of energy sharing in such a community. This is different from previously addressed energy sharing between buildings as our focus is on the improvement of community energy status, while traditionally research focused on reducing losses due to transmission and storage, or achieving economic gains. We model this problem in a multi-agent environment and propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solution. Each building is represented by an intelligent agent that learns over time the appropriate behaviour to share energy. We have evaluated the proposed solution in a multi-agent simulation built using osBrain. Results indicate that with time agents learn to collaborate and learn a policy comparable to the optimal policy, which in turn improves the ZEC's energy status. Buildings with no renewables preferred to request energy from their neighbours rather than from the supply grid.",0
"In Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) for zero energy communities we present a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning techniques to efficiently optimize smart grid operations. Our method allows multiple agents to work together toward a common goal: reducing energy consumption while maintaining high levels of comfort for residents. By integrating real-time sensor data from home appliances, HVAC systems, and renewable generation sources, our model can make intelligent decisions regarding energy usage, production, storage, and distribution. We demonstrate through simulation results that MADRL outperforms traditional approaches and achieves significant reductions in total electricity demand without sacrificing resident satisfaction. Our work has important implications for sustainability and climate change mitigation by showing how emerging artificial intelligence technologies can drive innovation and solve complex societal challenges at scale.",1
"Hyperparameter tuning is an omnipresent problem in machine learning as it is an integral aspect of obtaining the state-of-the-art performance for any model. Most often, hyperparameters are optimized just by training a model on a grid of possible hyperparameter values and taking the one that performs best on a validation sample (grid search). More recently, methods have been introduced that build a so-called surrogate model that predicts the validation loss for a specific hyperparameter setting, model and dataset and then sequentially select the next hyperparameter to test, based on a heuristic function of the expected value and the uncertainty of the surrogate model called acquisition function (sequential model-based Bayesian optimization, SMBO).   In this paper we model the hyperparameter optimization problem as a sequential decision problem, which hyperparameter to test next, and address it with reinforcement learning. This way our model does not have to rely on a heuristic acquisition function like SMBO, but can learn which hyperparameters to test next based on the subsequent reduction in validation loss they will eventually lead to, either because they yield good models themselves or because they allow the hyperparameter selection policy to build a better surrogate model that is able to choose better hyperparameters later on. Experiments on a large battery of 50 data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for hyperparameter learning.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to hyperparameter optimization (HPO) based on reinforcement learning (RL). HPO is typically performed using gradient ascent methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), but these approaches often fail to explore all regions of parameter space. In contrast, RL allows us to generate policies that can balance exploration and exploitation in order to efficiently optimize hyperparameters. We present a novel algorithm called Hyp-RL which combines REINFORCE with trust region optimization to learn policies that optimize hyperparameters in deep neural networks. Our experimental results show that Hyp-RL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of benchmark datasets. Our approach has important implications for the field of machine learning, as efficient HPO techniques allow researchers to more quickly iterate over their models and improve performance.",1
"Recommender systems play a crucial role in mitigating the problem of information overload by suggesting users' personalized items or services. The vast majority of traditional recommender systems consider the recommendation procedure as a static process and make recommendations following a fixed strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel recommender system with the capability of continuously improving its strategies during the interactions with users. We model the sequential interactions between users and a recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn the optimal strategies via recommending trial-and-error items and receiving reinforcements of these items from users' feedbacks. In particular, we introduce an online user-agent interacting environment simulator, which can pre-train and evaluate model parameters offline before applying the model online. Moreover, we validate the importance of list-wise recommendations during the interactions between users and agent, and develop a novel approach to incorporate them into the proposed framework LIRD for list-wide recommendations. The experimental results based on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",0
"This study proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach to solve list-wise recommendations. We first present a neural ranker that extracts features from raw data using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Then we employ deep Q-learning, which can deal with continuous action spaces and learn in an online manner, as our RL algorithm. Our goal is to maximize the number of clicks by recommending high quality items to users. Experiments on three real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for list-wise recommendation tasks, especially under extreme cold-start scenarios where very few interactions have been logged for users or items. Furthermore, extensive analyses show that deep RL achieves better performance than other heuristics because it captures complex relationships among items more effectively.",1
"Standard computer vision systems assume access to intelligently captured inputs (e.g., photos from a human photographer), yet autonomously capturing good observations is a major challenge in itself. We address the problem of learning to look around: how can an agent learn to acquire informative visual observations? We propose a reinforcement learning solution, where the agent is rewarded for reducing its uncertainty about the unobserved portions of its environment. Specifically, the agent is trained to select a short sequence of glimpses after which it must infer the appearance of its full environment. To address the challenge of sparse rewards, we further introduce sidekick policy learning, which exploits the asymmetry in observability between training and test time. The proposed methods learn observation policies that not only perform the completion task for which they are trained, but also generalize to exhibit useful ""look-around"" behavior for a range of active perception tasks.",0
"This paper investigates how active observation completion can lead to emergent exploratory look-around behaviors in artificial agents. We use deep learning techniques to train autonomous robots to actively observe and discover novelty in their environment.

We propose that these findings have implications for understanding cognition and behavior in both humans and animals, as well as applications in robotics and human-robot interaction.

Additionally, we offer theoretical analysis showing that under certain conditions, our algorithm achieves tractability, which allows us to compute solutions in reasonable time frames even as problem complexity grows exponentially. These results represent a major advance in the field of reinforcement learning and have important implications for applications ranging from robotics to finance.",1
"As reinforcement learning (RL) scales to solve increasingly complex tasks, interest continues to grow in the fields of AI safety and machine ethics. As a contribution to these fields, this paper introduces an extension to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), called Empathic DQN, that is loosely inspired both by empathy and the golden rule (""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you""). Empathic DQN aims to help mitigate negative side effects to other agents resulting from myopic goal-directed behavior. We assume a setting where a learning agent coexists with other independent agents (who receive unknown rewards), where some types of reward (e.g. negative rewards from physical harm) may generalize across agents. Empathic DQN combines the typical (self-centered) value with the estimated value of other agents, by imagining (by its own standards) the value of it being in the other's situation (by considering constructed states where both agents are swapped). Proof-of-concept results in two gridworld environments highlight the approach's potential to decrease collateral harms. While extending Empathic DQN to complex environments is non-trivial, we believe that this first step highlights the potential of bridge-work between machine ethics and RL to contribute useful priors for norm-abiding RL agents.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved significant success across a wide range of domains including games, control systems, and autonomous robots. However, these methods often lack human-like qualities such as emotional intelligence and empathy that could enable more advanced interaction and collaboration with humans. This paper presents a new framework called ""Empathic Deep Q-Learning"" (EDQL) that aims to bridge this gap by incorporating empathy into traditional reinforcement learning models. We show how EDQL can enhance decision making processes in complex environments, improve social interactions, and foster greater trust between agents and humans. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both task performance and subjective evaluations. Overall, we believe that EDQL represents an important step towards building artificial agents that are capable of understanding, adapting to, and interacting with their environment in ways that are intuitively familiar to humans.",1
"We propose a new perspective on representation learning in reinforcement learning based on geometric properties of the space of value functions. We leverage this perspective to provide formal evidence regarding the usefulness of value functions as auxiliary tasks. Our formulation considers adapting the representation to minimize the (linear) approximation of the value function of all stationary policies for a given environment. We show that this optimization reduces to making accurate predictions regarding a special class of value functions which we call adversarial value functions (AVFs). We demonstrate that using value functions as auxiliary tasks corresponds to an expected-error relaxation of our formulation, with AVFs a natural candidate, and identify a close relationship with proto-value functions (Mahadevan, 2005). We highlight characteristics of AVFs and their usefulness as auxiliary tasks in a series of experiments on the four-room domain.",0

"Hierarchy in reinforcement learning agents allows for control at multiple time scales yielding improved sample efficiency, the ability to deal with long time horizons and transferability of sub-policies to tasks outside the training distribution. It is often implemented as a master policy providing goals to a sub-policy. Ideally, we would like the goal-spaces to be learned, however, properties of optimal goal spaces still remain unknown and consequently there is no method yet to learn optimal goal spaces. Motivated by this, we systematically analyze how various modifications to the ground-truth goal-space affect learning in hierarchical models with the aim of identifying important properties of optimal goal spaces. Our results show that, while rotation of ground-truth goal spaces and noise had no effect, having additional unnecessary factors significantly impaired learning in hierarchical models.",0
"Title: Hierarchical policy learning is sensitive to goal space design Abstract In hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), policies are learned at multiple levels of abstraction to manage complex tasks and environments. However, the choice of the number of levels, granularity of subtasks within each level, and whether to use discrete or continuous goals can greatly impact HRL performance. This paper examines how variations in goal spaces affect HRL sensitivity across different benchmark domains including cartpole swingup, mountain car racing, and helicopter acrobatics. Experimental results show that poor goal space designs significantly decrease task performance, increase solution times, and lead to instability during training. We propose that proper tuning of the goal space parameters can improve sample efficiency, reduce variability, and enable solutions to previously unsolved tasks. These findings highlight the importance of careful consideration of the goal space during HRL design and provide insights into improving current methods by identifying optimal designs for specific problem classes.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning has the potential to be more sample efficient than model-free approaches. However, existing model-based methods are vulnerable to model bias, which leads to poor generalization and asymptotic performance compared to model-free counterparts. In addition, they are typically based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework, which not only is computationally inefficient at decision time but also does not enable policy transfer due to the lack of an explicit policy representation. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware model-based policy optimization framework which solves those issues. In this framework, the agent simultaneously learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and optimizes the policy according to these learned models. In the optimization step, the policy gradient is computed by automatic differentiation through the models. With respect to sample efficiency alone, our approach shows promising results on challenging continuous control benchmarks with competitive asymptotic performance and significantly lower sample complexity than state-of-the-art baselines.",0
"Title: ""Uncertainty-Aware Model-Based Policy Optimization""  Abstract: In many real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, decision making under uncertainty remains a significant challenge. This issue arises due to various sources of uncertainty including sensor noise, environmental disturbances, and modeling errors that cannot be eliminated completely. Thus, building efficient algorithms to optimize policies in uncertain environments is crucial for achieving better performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware model-based policy optimization framework that leverages both robust optimization methods and statistical inference techniques to handle different types of uncertainties in the system dynamics and cost functions. Our approach combines probabilistic models, Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian estimation, and risk-constrained optimization to develop robust control policies that minimize the expected value of a given cost function over the space of all possible scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on three benchmark problems ranging from single-agent settings to multi-agent coordination tasks, where we showcase the improvements in stability, safety, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, our results highlight the potential impact of incorporating uncertainty awareness into model-based policy search algorithms, enabling more robust decisions in uncertain systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning agents that operate in diverse and complex environments can benefit from the structured decomposition of their behavior. Often, this is addressed in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the aim is to decompose a policy into lower-level primitives or options, and a higher-level meta-policy that triggers the appropriate behaviors for a given situation. However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate decisions in all states. In this work, we propose a policy design that decomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning, but without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for themselves whether they wish to act in the current state. We use an information-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each primitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make a decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the current state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as little information as possible, which leads to natural competition and specialization. We experimentally demonstrate that this policy architecture improves over both flat and hierarchical policies in terms of generalization.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to reinforcement learning that uses competitive ensembles of information-constrained primitives.

Additionally, we provide insights into why this method works by analyzing the behavior of the competitive ensemble during training. Overall, our work provides a promising direction for future research in deep reinforcement learning.",1
"Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning framework for training an autonomous agent based on rewards, has shown outstanding results in various domains. However, it is known that learning a good policy is difficult in a domain where rewards are rare. We propose a method, optimistic proximal policy optimization (OPPO) to alleviate this difficulty. OPPO considers the uncertainty of the estimated total return and optimistically evaluates the policy based on that amount. We show that OPPO outperforms the existing methods in a tabular task.",0
"Here is an example of how one might write such an abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving sequential decision making problems in domains ranging from robotics to computer games. One popular family of algorithms in RL is called policy gradient methods, which aim to directly learn policies that maximize expected returns by approximately following gradients of the return with respect to the parameters of the policy. However, these algorithms can often suffer from high variance due to the need to estimate the value function using finite samples and the instability caused by taking gradients with respect to model parameters. Recently, several variants based on proximal optimization have been proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. These approaches optimize a surrogate objective that is less sensitive to estimation errors and better handles non-smooth objectives arising from constraints. In this paper we propose a novel variant of proximal policy optimization (PPO), termed ""Optimistic PPO"", that further improves stability and efficiency over existing methods. Our method adapts to the problem difficulty in an optimistic manner, enabling faster convergence while maintaining low variance and robustness to hyperparameters. We evaluate our algorithm on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art PPO baselines and other competitive algorithms in the field. This work contributes towards understanding how to design stable and efficient actor-critic algorithms for sequential decision making under uncertainty, paving the path for deployment of RL systems in safety critical applications.",1
"When agents interact with a complex environment, they must form and maintain beliefs about the relevant aspects of that environment. We propose a way to efficiently train expressive generative models in complex environments. We show that a predictive algorithm with an expressive generative model can form stable belief-states in visually rich and dynamic 3D environments. More precisely, we show that the learned representation captures the layout of the environment as well as the position and orientation of the agent. Our experiments show that the model substantially improves data-efficiency on a number of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks compared with strong model-free baseline agents. We find that predicting multiple steps into the future (overshooting), in combination with an expressive generative model, is critical for stable representations to emerge. In practice, using expressive generative models in RL is computationally expensive and we propose a scheme to reduce this computational burden, allowing us to build agents that are competitive with model-free baselines.",0
"Abstract: Shaping belief states can improve reinforcement learning algorithms by making them more effective at exploration, leveraging external memory, and handling delayed rewards. However, existing methods often require additional expert knowledge or explicit modeling of uncertainty distributions. In this work we present Generative Environment Models (GEMs), which enable deep neural network based policy improvement by generating high quality belief states from raw input observations without requiring any domain specific knowledge or handcrafted features. We demonstrate that GEMs outperform current state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmark domains using offline pretraining followed by fine tuning online with real experience. Furthermore, we show that our agent achieves superior performance compared to strong baselines when trained exclusively online without access to experience data from other agents. Finally, we provide analyses indicating that GEMs learn meaningful representations in latent spaces shared across different environments, which may enable generalization beyond those seen during training time. Our results suggest significant promise for employing deep generative models as key components in modern RL systems towards solving challenging real world problems.",1
"In Reinforcement Learning we look for meaning in the flow of input/output information. If we do not find meaning, the information flow is not more than noise to us. Before we are able to find meaning, we should first learn how to discover and identify objects. What is an object? In this article we will demonstrate that an object is an event-driven model. These models are a generalization of action-driven models. In Markov Decision Process we have an action-driven model which changes its state at each step. The advantage of event-driven models is their greater sustainability as they change their states only upon the occurrence of particular events. These events may occur very rarely, therefore the state of the event-driven model is much more predictable.",0

"Although reinforcement learning has made great strides recently, a continuing limitation is that it requires an extremely high number of interactions with the environment. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of reusing experience from the experience replay buffer in the Deep Q-Learning algorithm. We test the effectiveness of applying learning update steps multiple times per environmental step in the VizDoom environment and show first, this requires a change in the learning rate, and second that it does not improve the performance of the agent. Furthermore, we show that updating less frequently is effective up to a ratio of 4:1, after which performance degrades significantly. These results quantitatively confirm the widespread practice of performing learning updates every 4th environmental step.",0

"Our goal is for agents to optimize the right reward function, despite how difficult it is for us to specify what that is. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) enables us to infer reward functions from demonstrations, but it usually assumes that the expert is noisily optimal. Real people, on the other hand, often have systematic biases: risk-aversion, myopia, etc. One option is to try to characterize these biases and account for them explicitly during learning. But in the era of deep learning, a natural suggestion researchers make is to avoid mathematical models of human behavior that are fraught with specific assumptions, and instead use a purely data-driven approach. We decided to put this to the test -- rather than relying on assumptions about which specific bias the demonstrator has when planning, we instead learn the demonstrator's planning algorithm that they use to generate demonstrations, as a differentiable planner. Our exploration yielded mixed findings: on the one hand, learning the planner can lead to better reward inference than relying on the wrong assumption; on the other hand, this benefit is dwarfed by the loss we incur by going from an exact to a differentiable planner. This suggest that at least for the foreseeable future, agents need a middle ground between the flexibility of data-driven methods and the useful bias of known human biases. Code is available at https://tinyurl.com/learningbiases.",0
"This paper explores the feasibility of learning human biases from data rather than assuming them. We propose that learned biases may provide more accurate predictions of human reward functions compared to assumed biases commonly used by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. By investigating various sources of human bias data including behavioral experiments, eye tracking studies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and user feedback, we aim to shed light on both theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations for incorporating learned biases into RL algorithms. Our findings suggest that while there exists rich datasets quantifying human biases across numerous dimensions and tasks, significant challenges remain in effectively using such data to train artificial agents capable of generalizing beyond specific contexts. Nonetheless, we argue that future research towards combining empirical insights into cognition with formal models of decision making has great potential for driving advances at the intersection of psychology and computer science.",1

Against end-to-end learning, state representation learning can help learn a compact, efficient and relevant representation of states that speeds up policy learning, reducing the number of samples needed, and that is easier to interpret. We evaluate several state representation learning methods on goal based robotics tasks and propose a new unsupervised model that stacks representations and combines strengths of several of these approaches. This method encodes all the relevant features, performs on par or better than end-to-end learning with better sample efficiency, and is robust to hyper-parameters change.",0
"State representation learning has emerged as a promising approach to improving the performance of robots that learn through trial and error. In traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, both feature extraction and policy learning are tightly coupled, making it difficult to identify which aspect of the algorithm is responsible for poor performance. We propose decoupling these two components by training state representations separately before using them to train policies directly. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve sample efficiency and final task performance on challenging tasks involving visually guided navigation and manipulation skills. By examining the impact of different state representation techniques on learning behavior, we provide insight into how state representation influences policy learning and highlight opportunities for future research in robotics and artificial intelligence. Overall, our work underscores the importance of careful consideration of perceptual processes in designing effective learning systems for high-dimensional real-world domains.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a data efficient approach for learning control tasks but is difficult to utilize in domains with complex observations such as images. In this paper, we present a method for learning representations that are suitable for iterative model-based policy improvement, even when the underlying dynamical system has complex dynamics and image observations, in that these representations are optimized for inferring simple dynamics and cost models given data from the current policy. This enables a model-based RL method based on the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) to be used for systems with image observations. We evaluate our approach on a range of robotics tasks, including manipulation with a real-world robotic arm directly from images. We find that our method produces substantially better final performance than other model-based RL methods while being significantly more efficient than model-free RL.",0
"Incorporate key phrases that will make readers want to learn more. The proposed methodology combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with structured representations in order to improve model-based RL algorithms. By doing so, we aim to address some of the limitations commonly associated with DRL approaches, such as poor sample efficiency and difficulty dealing with high-dimensional state spaces. Our method involves training a neural network to predict both Q values and parameters of the transition model used by the agent. This allows us to leverage recent advances in deep generative models, while still utilizing traditional RL methods like value iteration and Monte Carlo tree search. Additionally, our method can handle tasks where different actions have vastly different continuous action spaces, which has been problematic for many previous DRL approaches. Through experiments on several challenging control tasks and comparisons against other popular baselines, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach at solving complex problems in simulation.",1
"We consider the problem of imitation learning from expert demonstrations in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Belief representations, which characterize the distribution over the latent states in a POMDP, have been modeled using recurrent neural networks and probabilistic latent variable models, and shown to be effective for reinforcement learning in POMDPs. In this work, we investigate the belief representation learning problem for generative adversarial imitation learning in POMDPs. Instead of training the belief module and the policy separately as suggested in prior work, we learn the belief module jointly with the policy, using a task-aware imitation loss to ensure that the representation is more aligned with the policy's objective. To improve robustness of representation, we introduce several informative belief regularization techniques, including multi-step prediction of dynamics and action-sequences. Evaluated on various partially observable continuous-control locomotion tasks, our belief-module imitation learning approach (BMIL) substantially outperforms several baselines, including the original GAIL algorithm and the task-agnostic belief learning algorithm. Extensive ablation analysis indicates the effectiveness of task-aware belief learning and belief regularization.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for learning belief representations in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We introduce a new algorithm called BELLE that allows agents to learn a compact and informative representation of their belief state. Our approach relies on imitating expert behavior, which provides rich supervision during training. Experimental results show that our agent learns more efficient policies than previous methods, resulting in improved performance across several challenging domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method can scale up to large problems by successfully solving Montezuma's Revenge, one of the most iconic Atari games. Our work has important implications for developing autonomous agents that can effectively reason under uncertainty.",1
"Animals need to devise strategies to maximize returns while interacting with their environment based on incoming noisy sensory observations. Task-relevant states, such as the agent's location within an environment or the presence of a predator, are often not directly observable but must be inferred using available sensory information. Successor representations (SR) have been proposed as a middle-ground between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning strategies, allowing for fast value computation and rapid adaptation to changes in the reward function or goal locations. Indeed, recent studies suggest that features of neural responses are consistent with the SR framework. However, it is not clear how such representations might be learned and computed in partially observed, noisy environments. Here, we introduce a neurally plausible model using distributional successor features, which builds on the distributed distributional code for the representation and computation of uncertainty, and which allows for efficient value function computation in partially observed environments via the successor representation. We show that distributional successor features can support reinforcement learning in noisy environments in which direct learning of successful policies is infeasible.",0
"This research presents a neurally plausible model that has been trained to learn successor representations in partially observable environments. We used deep reinforcement learning algorithms to train our agents to predict future states based on their current observations. Our experiments show that our agent can learn efficient policies for sequential decision making problems even under partial observability constraints. Furthermore, we compared our results against human benchmarks and found that our model outperforms these benchmarks by a significant margin. Finally, we discuss some implications of these findings and suggest potential directions for further work in this area.",1
"Rewards and punishments in different forms are pervasive and present in a wide variety of decision-making scenarios. By observing the outcome of a sufficient number of repeated trials, one would gradually learn the value and usefulness of a particular policy or strategy. However, in a given environment, the outcomes resulting from different trials are subject to chance influence and variations. In learning about the usefulness of a given policy, significant costs are involved in systematically undertaking the sequential trials; therefore, in most learning episodes, one would wish to keep the cost within bounds by adopting learning stopping rules. In this paper, we examine the deployment of different stopping strategies in given learning environments which vary from highly stringent for mission critical operations to highly tolerant for non-mission critical operations, and emphasis is placed on the former with particular application to aviation safety. In policy evaluation, two sequential phases of learning are identified, and we describe the outcomes variations using a probabilistic model, with closedform expressions obtained for the key measures of performance. Decision rules that map the trial observations to policy choices are also formulated. In addition, simulation experiments are performed, which corroborate the validity of the theoretical results.",0
"In order to effectively adopt and validate policies that align with organizational goals and values, decision makers must carefully consider how those policies can be enacted efficiently and with the greatest chance of success. One approach to addressing these challenges involves leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, which allow organizations to model complex interactions among agents in their environments and identify optimal policy decisions based on the resulting data. This paper discusses the application of reinforcement learning algorithms to aid in the adoption and validation of effective policies within companies. The study presents the benefits of using reinforcement learning methods in policy design and implementation processes, as well as potential limitations that should be considered when applying these approaches in real-world settings. Ultimately, the results suggest that incorporating reinforcement learning techniques into policy development and evaluation offers significant advantages for promoting successful outcomes while minimizing risk and uncertainty.",1
"End-to-end reinforcement learning agents learn a state representation and a policy at the same time. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been trained successfully as reinforcement learning agents in settings like dialogue that require structured prediction. In this paper, we investigate the representations learned by RNN-based agents when trained with both policy gradient and value-based methods. We show through extensive experiments and analysis that, when trained with policy gradient, recurrent neural networks often fail to learn a state representation that leads to an optimal policy in settings where the same action should be taken at different states. To explain this failure, we highlight the problem of state aliasing, which entails conflating two or more distinct states in the representation space. We demonstrate that state aliasing occurs when several states share the same optimal action and the agent is trained via policy gradient. We characterize this phenomenon through experiments on a simple maze setting and a more complex text-based game, and make recommendations for training RNNs with reinforcement learning.",0
"State aliasing occurs when hidden states within Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models become indistinguishable from one another during training, resulting in poor generalization performance on test data. This study investigates the causes and effects of state aliasing by analyzing several benchmark datasets using different structured prediction tasks with varying degrees of complexity. Our experiments show that state aliasing can have a significant impact on RNN model accuracy, particularly for more complex problems. We propose potential solutions to reduce the effect of state aliasing, including regularization techniques and initialization methods. Through our analysis, we aim to provide insights into improving the robustness and stability of RNN models for structured prediction tasks.",1
"We propose a novel framework for multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL). Using a variational inference formulation, we learn policies that generalize across both changing dynamics and goals. The resulting policies are parametrized by shared parameters that allow for transfer between different dynamics and goal conditions, and by task-specific latent-space embeddings that allow for specialization to particular tasks. We show how the latent-spaces enable generalization to unseen dynamics and goals conditions. Additionally, policies equipped with such embeddings serve as a space of skills (or options) for hierarchical reinforcement learning. Since we can change task dynamics and goals independently, we name our framework Disentangled Skill Embeddings (DSE).",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to representing skills within reinforcement learning agents using disentangled skill embeddings. These embeddings allow for more efficient transfer of knowledge between tasks by separating shared latent factors from task-specific ones. Our method uses adversarial training and automatic differentiation techniques to learn these representations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on several benchmark domains, making it well-suited for real-world applications where task generalization is essential. Overall, this work advances the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning and highlights the potential of unsupervised representation learning methods for improving agent performance across multiple domains.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress in the field of continuous control, such as physical control and autonomous driving. However, it is challenging for a reinforcement model to learn a policy for each task sequentially due to catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the model would forget knowledge it learned in the past when trained on a new task. We consider this challenge from two perspectives: i) acquiring task-specific skills is difficult since task information and rewards are not highly related; ii) learning knowledge from previous experience is difficult in continuous control domains. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework namely Continual Diversity Adversarial Network (CDAN). We first develop an unsupervised diversity exploration method to learn task-specific skills using an unsupervised objective. Then, we propose an adversarial self-correction mechanism to learn knowledge by exploiting past experience. The two learning procedures are presumably reciprocal. To evaluate the proposed method, we propose a new continuous reinforcement learning environment named Continual Ant Maze (CAM) and a new metric termed Normalized Shorten Distance (NSD). The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of diversity exploration and self-correction. It is worthwhile noting that our final result outperforms baseline by 18.35% in terms of NSD, and 0.61 according to the average reward.",0
"This work presents a new approach to continual reinforcement learning that addresses several key challenges in the field: diversity exploration and adversarial self-correction. We propose a novel method that integrates these two aspects into one framework, allowing agents to effectively learn from diverse experiences while ensuring robustness against adversarial conditions. Our approach relies on a simple yet effective mechanism for promoting diversity through regularization, combined with an adversarial training scheme that helps the agent adapt to changing environments by generating correction signals. Through extensive experiments on a range of benchmark tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, confirming that the combination of diversity exploration and adversarial self-correction leads to significant performance improvements across different domains. Overall, our results provide important insights into how machine learning systems can better cope with real-world scenarios characterized by high levels of uncertainty and complexity.",1
"Exploration in sparse reward reinforcement learning remains an open challenge. Many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic motivation to complement the sparse extrinsic reward signal, giving the agent more opportunities to receive feedback during exploration. Commonly these signals are added as bonus rewards, which results in a mixture policy that neither conducts exploration nor task fulfillment resolutely. In this paper, we instead learn separate intrinsic and extrinsic task policies and schedule between these different drives to accelerate exploration and stabilize learning. Moreover, we introduce a new type of intrinsic reward denoted as successor feature control (SFC), which is general and not task-specific. It takes into account statistics over complete trajectories and thus differs from previous methods that only use local information to evaluate intrinsic motivation. We evaluate our proposed scheduled intrinsic drive (SID) agent using three different environments with pure visual inputs: VizDoom, DeepMind Lab and DeepMind Control Suite. The results show a substantially improved exploration efficiency with SFC and the hierarchical usage of the intrinsic drives. A video of our experimental results can be found at https://youtu.be/b0MbY3lUlEI.",0
"""Exploration is an integral part of learning, as it allows individuals to uncover new knowledge and expand their understanding of the world around them. However, traditional approaches to exploration often rely solely on extrinsic motivators, such as rewards or punishments, to drive behavior. Recent research has suggested that intrinsic motivation can play an important role in promoting sustained exploratory behaviors by fostering a sense of curiosity and interest in the subject matter at hand. This study aimed to develop a hierarchical framework for understanding how intrinsic drive affects exploratory behaviors and promote more efficient self-directed learning processes. By examining the underlying components of intrinsic motivation and the relationship between different levels of hierarchy, we were able to identify key factors that influence intrinsically motivated exploration. Our findings suggest that by incorporating these principles into educational practices, teachers can encourage students to engage in sustained exploration and take ownership over their own learning experiences.""",1
"Real Time Strategy (RTS) games require macro strategies as well as micro strategies to obtain satisfactory performance since it has large state space, action space, and hidden information. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning model for mastering Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games, a sub-genre of RTS games. The novelty of this work are: (1) proposing a hierarchical framework, where agents execute macro strategies by imitation learning and carry out micromanipulations through reinforcement learning, (2) developing a simple self-learning method to get better sample efficiency for training, and (3) designing a dense reward function for multi-agent cooperation in the absence of game engine or Application Programming Interface (API). Finally, various experiments have been performed to validate the superior performance of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Agent successfully learns to combat and defeat bronze-level built-in AI with 100% win rate, and experiments show that our method can create a competitive multi-agent for a kind of mobile MOBA game {\it King of Glory} in 5v5 mode.",0
"This is an abstract: ""Hierarchical reinforcement learning has proven effective at solving sequential decision making tasks in environments where a single agent interacts with simple state spaces.

"We present Placeto, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to efficiently find device placements for distributed neural network training. Unlike prior approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph, Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied to any graph. We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1x fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for learning generalizable device placement algorithms in distributed machine learning. We address the challenge of determining how to allocate resources among devices such that training time and accuracy can both be optimized effectively. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning to make decisions based on feedback from previous iterations, allowing it to learn over time and adapt to changing environments. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across multiple datasets and configurations. By improving resource allocation, we provide an important step towards enabling more efficient and effective distributed ML systems.",1
"Global routing has been a historically challenging problem in electronic circuit design, where the challenge is to connect a large and arbitrary number of circuit components with wires without violating the design rules for the printed circuit boards or integrated circuits. Similar routing problems also exist in the design of complex hydraulic systems, pipe systems and logistic networks. Existing solutions typically consist of greedy algorithms and hard-coded heuristics. As such, existing approaches suffer from a lack of model flexibility and non-optimum solutions. As an alternative approach, this work presents a deep reinforcement learning method for solving the global routing problem in a simulated environment. At the heart of the proposed method is deep reinforcement learning that enables an agent to produce an optimal policy for routing based on the variety of problems it is presented with leveraging the conjoint optimization mechanism of deep reinforcement learning. Conjoint optimization mechanism is explained and demonstrated in details; the best network structure and the parameters of the learned model are explored. Based on the fine-tuned model, routing solutions and rewards are presented and analyzed. The results indicate that the approach can outperform the benchmark method of a sequential A* method, suggesting a promising potential for deep reinforcement learning for global routing and other routing or path planning problems in general. Another major contribution of this work is the development of a global routing problem sets generator with the ability to generate parameterized global routing problem sets with different size and constraints, enabling evaluation of different routing algorithms and the generation of training datasets for future data-driven routing approaches.",0
Here’s an example abstract. I don’t know how good it is. In this work we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for global routing problems in electronic design automation (EDA). We formulate routing as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent learns from interactions with the environment. Our approach combines local search heuristics with neural network function approximation to improve sample efficiency and solution quality compared to prior works using deep reinforcement learning alone. We evaluate our algorithm on benchmark circuits with different designs and demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art EDA algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results show promising potential for deploying machine learning techniques in industrial applications of VLSI CAD and pave the way for further research in hybrid methods combining the strengths of MDP models and classical optimization techniques.,1
"Interference among concurrent transmissions in a wireless network is a key factor limiting the system performance. One way to alleviate this problem is to manage the radio resources in order to maximize either the average or the worst-case performance. However, joint consideration of both metrics is often neglected as they are competing in nature. In this article, a mechanism for radio resource management using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed, which strikes the right trade-off between maximizing the average and the $5^{th}$ percentile user throughput. Each transmitter in the network is equipped with a deep RL agent, receiving partial observations from the network (e.g., channel quality, interference level, etc.) and deciding whether to be active or inactive at each scheduling interval for given radio resources, a process referred to as link scheduling. Based on the actions of all agents, the network emits a reward to the agents, indicating how good their joint decisions were. The proposed framework enables the agents to make decisions in a distributed manner, and the reward is designed in such a way that the agents strive to guarantee a minimum performance, leading to a fair resource allocation among all users across the network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to decentralized baselines in terms of average and $5^{th}$ percentile user throughput, while achieving performance close to that of a centralized exhaustive search approach. Moreover, the proposed framework is robust to mismatches between training and testing scenarios. In particular, it is shown that an agent trained on a network with low transmitter density maintains its performance and outperforms the baselines when deployed in a network with a higher transmitter density.",0
"In this paper, we present a distributed framework for radio resource management (RRM) that accounts for multiple learning agents competing over shared resources. This framework enables each agent to learn scheduling policies without relying on central coordination by explicitly representing and incorporating other agents’ intentions into their own decision processes. Our method achieves these goals through two key innovations: i) a novel algorithmic structure that decomposes RRM tasks along both time and frequency dimensions, allowing for fine-grained coordination between agents; ii) the development of new message passing mechanisms designed specifically for efficient communication among parallel agents attempting joint optimization problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate improved performance compared to alternative multiagent approaches as well as traditional centralized schemes under challenging scenarios involving diverse network topologies and user traffic loads. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of our framework in coping with decentralized decision making while balancing systemwide objectives against individual preferences.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with model-predictive control or online planning has shown great potential for locomotion control tasks in terms of both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Despite their initial successes, the existing planning methods search from candidate sequences randomly generated in the action space, which is inefficient in complex high-dimensional environments. In this paper, we propose a novel MBRL algorithm, model-based policy planning (POPLIN), that combines policy networks with online planning. More specifically, we formulate action planning at each time-step as an optimization problem using neural networks. We experiment with both optimization w.r.t. the action sequences initialized from the policy network, and also online optimization directly w.r.t. the parameters of the policy network. We show that POPLIN obtains state-of-the-art performance in the MuJoCo benchmarking environments, being about 3x more sample efficient than the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as PETS, TD3 and SAC. To explain the effectiveness of our algorithm, we show that the optimization surface in parameter space is smoother than in action space. Further more, we found the distilled policy network can be effectively applied without the expansive model predictive control during test time for some environments such as Cheetah. Code is released in https://github.com/WilsonWangTHU/POPLIN.",0
"Abstract: This work presents an exploration into model-based planning using policy networks, which are deep learning models that have recently gained popularity due to their ability to generate complex policies from raw input data. Traditionally, planning algorithms rely on handcrafted features and heuristics to make decisions, but these methods can be limited by human biases and domain knowledge gaps. In contrast, policy networks offer an opportunity to learn optimal plans directly from sensorimotor experience without any explicit guidance. We propose a novel approach called MbPlan{}, which combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based planning using policy networks. Our method leverages the strengths of both approaches while addressing some of their limitations. The results show that MbPlan{} outperforms state-of-the-art model-free baselines in several continuous control benchmark tasks and demonstrates better sample efficiency and generalization across environments. These findings suggest that integrating model-based planning with policy networks could open new directions in artificial intelligence research and enable more efficient exploration and decision making in complex domains.",1
"Policy gradient methods are widely used for control in reinforcement learning, particularly for the continuous action setting. There have been a host of theoretically sound algorithms proposed for the on-policy setting, due to the existence of the policy gradient theorem which provides a simplified form for the gradient. In off-policy learning, however, where the behaviour policy is not necessarily attempting to learn and follow the optimal policy for the given task, the existence of such a theorem has been elusive. In this work, we solve this open problem by providing the first off-policy policy gradient theorem. The key to the derivation is the use of $emphatic$ $weightings$. We develop a new actor-critic algorithm$\unicode{x2014}$called Actor Critic with Emphatic weightings (ACE)$\unicode{x2014}$that approximates the simplified gradients provided by the theorem. We demonstrate in a simple counterexample that previous off-policy policy gradient methods$\unicode{x2014}$particularly OffPAC and DPG$\unicode{x2014}$converge to the wrong solution whereas ACE finds the optimal solution.",0
"This paper presents a new method for off-policy policy gradient theorem using emphasized weightings, which allows for improved performance over traditional methods. By utilizing a novel approach that considers both on-policy and off-policy data, our proposed method can more accurately estimate the value function and achieve better overall results. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings have important implications for researchers working in reinforcement learning and highlight the potential benefits of incorporating emphasized weightings into off-policy learning algorithms.",1
"Experience replay enables reinforcement learning agents to memorize and reuse past experiences, just as humans replay memories for the situation at hand. Contemporary off-policy algorithms either replay past experiences uniformly or utilize a rule-based replay strategy, which may be sub-optimal. In this work, we consider learning a replay policy to optimize the cumulative reward. Replay learning is challenging because the replay memory is noisy and large, and the cumulative reward is unstable. To address these issues, we propose a novel experience replay optimization (ERO) framework which alternately updates two policies: the agent policy, and the replay policy. The agent is updated to maximize the cumulative reward based on the replayed data, while the replay policy is updated to provide the agent with the most useful experiences. The conducted experiments on various continuous control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of ERO, empirically showing promise in experience replay learning to improve the performance of off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has been applied to a wide range of problems, including game playing and autonomous driving. While many successful applications have been reported, some challenges remain unsolved or poorly understood, such as the sensitivity of training stability to hyperparameters, model architecture, input preprocessing, etc. To address these issues, we propose an extension of experience replay by storing the transitions along with their corresponding network output values during training. This memory buffer allows for offline batch selection that maximizes accumulated future return instead of just visit count. By doing so, we encourage visitation of high expected value transitions while suppressing those with low values. Our results show significant improvement on several benchmark domains compared to state-of-the-art methods without explicit exploration bonuses.",1
"Estimates of predictive uncertainty are important for accurate model-based planning and reinforcement learning. However, predictive uncertainties---especially ones derived from modern deep learning systems---can be inaccurate and impose a bottleneck on performance. This paper explores which uncertainties are needed for model-based reinforcement learning and argues that good uncertainties must be calibrated, i.e. their probabilities should match empirical frequencies of predicted events. We describe a simple way to augment any model-based reinforcement learning agent with a calibrated model and show that doing so consistently improves planning, sample complexity, and exploration. On the \textsc{HalfCheetah} MuJoCo task, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance using 50\% fewer samples than the current leading approach. Our findings suggest that calibration can improve the performance of model-based reinforcement learning with minimal computational and implementation overhead.",0
"This paper presents an approach to deep reinforcement learning that combines model-based planning with calibration techniques from classical control theory. We demonstrate how this combination can lead to improved stability and performance in complex tasks. Our method builds on recent advances in deep neural networks for control problems, but extends them by incorporating uncertainty estimation into the learning process. This allows our agent to maintain more accurate beliefs over time, which leads to better decision making. We evaluate our algorithm on several challenging benchmarks, including classic control problems such as inverted pendulum and cartpole, and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. We conclude by discussing potential applications of these ideas in other domains.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) holds the promise of automating the acquisition of complex controllers that can map sensory inputs directly to low-level actions. In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable learning locomotion skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit model of the robot dynamics. Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world robotic tasks is exceptionally difficult, primarily due to poor sample complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While hyperparameters can be easily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively expensive on physical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through extensive trial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient deep RL algorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning and only a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this method to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can acquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two hours, without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is robust to moderate variations in the environment. We further show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters. Videos of training and the learned policy can be found on the project website.",0

With continued progress in both domains, there is ample opportunity for further improvements upon our results towards enabling autonomous robots capable of robust locomotion in varied and unstructured settings.",1
"Imitation Learning describes the problem of recovering an expert policy from demonstrations. While inverse reinforcement learning approaches are known to be very sample-efficient in terms of expert demonstrations, they usually require problem-dependent reward functions or a (task-)specific reward-function regularization. In this paper, we show a natural connection between inverse reinforcement learning approaches and Optimal Transport, that enables more general reward functions with desirable properties (e.g., smoothness). Based on our observation, we propose a novel approach called Wasserstein Adversarial Imitation Learning. Our approach considers the Kantorovich potentials as a reward function and further leverages regularized optimal transport to enable large-scale applications. In several robotic experiments, our approach outperforms the baselines in terms of average cumulative rewards and shows a significant improvement in sample-efficiency, by requiring just one expert demonstration.",0
"Abstract: The goal of imitation learning is to learn from demonstrations by inferring the underlying policy that generated those demonstrations. One popular approach to imitation learning is adversarial training, where a generator network generates actions and an discriminator network evaluates whether these actions are real (i.e., taken from the expert) or fake (generated by the imitating agent). However, existing methods suffer from several limitations, such as instability in optimization, mode collapse, and poor generalization performance. In this work, we propose Wasserstein Adversarial Imitation Learning (WAIL), which addresses these issues through an unified objective function based on the Earth Mover’s distance metric. WAIL simultaneously optimizes both policies, allowing for more stable training and better alignment between the learned policy and the expert policy. Furthermore, our method overcomes mode collapse problems through regularizing the latent space of the generative model. Our results show significant improvements in terms of stability during training, higher quality samples, faster convergence speed, and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on a range of continuous control tasks. In summary, WAIL provides an effective solution for solving high-dimensional continuous action spaces while addressing common challenges faced by existing methods, making it suitable for real-world applications.",1
"We consider the core reinforcement-learning problem of on-policy value function approximation from a batch of trajectory data, and focus on various issues of Temporal Difference (TD) learning and Monte Carlo (MC) policy evaluation. The two methods are known to achieve complementary bias-variance trade-off properties, with TD tending to achieve lower variance but potentially higher bias. In this paper, we argue that the larger bias of TD can be a result of the amplification of local approximation errors. We address this by proposing an algorithm that adaptively switches between TD and MC in each state, thus mitigating the propagation of errors. Our method is based on learned confidence intervals that detect biases of TD estimates. We demonstrate in a variety of policy evaluation tasks that this simple adaptive algorithm performs competitively with the best approach in hindsight, suggesting that learned confidence intervals are a powerful technique for adapting policy evaluation to use TD or MC returns in a data-driven way.",0
"Here is a potential abstract:  The evaluation of policies plays a key role in reinforcement learning algorithms, as it enables accurate estimates of expected returns from different actions to be obtained. This can improve policy selection and optimization, which ultimately affects performance. In practice, policy evaluation requires dealing with per-state uncertainty, especially when evaluating policies that require multiple steps to fully unfold.  This paper presents a novel approach to policy evaluation called adaptive temporal-difference (TD) learning with per-state uncertainty estimates. Our method allows for efficient, on-line estimation of both action values and per-state uncertainties by leveraging recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference. We show how our method can significantly reduce error and enhance stability compared to existing TD methods without per-state uncertainty estimates, even when only sparse rewards are available.  In summary, we present a novel framework for temporal-difference learning with per-state uncertainty estimates, which promises improved accuracy and efficiency for policy evaluation in real-world applications. By enabling more informed exploration and exploitation decisions, our method holds significant promise for improving overall system performance in complex decision making tasks such as robotics control, game playing, and autonomous vehicles.",1
"We propose a unified mechanism for achieving coordination and communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), through rewarding agents for having causal influence over other agents' actions. Causal influence is assessed using counterfactual reasoning. At each timestep, an agent simulates alternate actions that it could have taken, and computes their effect on the behavior of other agents. Actions that lead to bigger changes in other agents' behavior are considered influential and are rewarded. We show that this is equivalent to rewarding agents for having high mutual information between their actions. Empirical results demonstrate that influence leads to enhanced coordination and communication in challenging social dilemma environments, dramatically increasing the learning curves of the deep RL agents, and leading to more meaningful learned communication protocols. The influence rewards for all agents can be computed in a decentralized way by enabling agents to learn a model of other agents using deep neural networks. In contrast, key previous works on emergent communication in the MARL setting were unable to learn diverse policies in a decentralized manner and had to resort to centralized training. Consequently, the influence reward opens up a window of new opportunities for research in this area.",0
"Many modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications involve multi-agent systems where agents interact with each other in dynamic environments while pursuing their individual objectives. Modeling social influence among agents has been shown to improve the performance of such systems in terms of coordination, cooperation, and overall efficiency. However, existing models often rely on handcrafted rules or heuristics that may lack flexibility and generalizability across different domains. To address these limitations, we propose using deep reinforcement learning algorithms that explicitly model social influence as intrinsic motivation for multi-agent decision making. Our approach uses novel neural network architectures to learn distributed representations of agent preferences and socially influenced reward functions. We evaluate our method through comprehensive simulations and case studies, demonstrating improved system performance compared to baseline methods that neglect social influences or use simplified assumptions. These results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating richer psychological phenomena into formal AI models, paving the way towards more human-like collaboration between autonomous agents in complex, real-world scenarios.

"Efficient exploration is necessary to achieve good sample efficiency for reinforcement learning in general. From small, tabular settings such as gridworlds to large, continuous and sparse reward settings such as robotic object manipulation tasks, exploration through adding an uncertainty bonus to the reward function has been shown to be effective when the uncertainty is able to accurately drive exploration towards promising states. However reward bonuses can still be inefficient since they are non-stationary, which means that we must wait for function approximators to catch up and converge again when uncertainties change. We propose the idea of directed exploration, that is learning a goal-conditioned policy where goals are simply other states, and using that to directly try to reach states with large uncertainty. The goal-conditioned policy is independent of uncertainty and is thus stationary. We show in our experiments how directed exploration is more efficient at exploration and more robust to how the uncertainty is computed than adding bonuses to rewards.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), exploration is crucial for discovering novel solutions and improving performance beyond trial-and-error. However, conventional RL algorithms often struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation effectively, especially in complex environments where random action selection can lead to highly suboptimal behavior. We propose a directedexploration framework that guides the agent towards informative state-action pairs based on uncertainty estimates derived from neural networks trained by inverse reinforcement learning. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep generative models to explicitly capture multi-modal beliefs over latent states and actions that maximize expected information gain under unknown dynamics. Experiments show consistent improvements across challenging continuous control benchmarks compared to standard methods relying on intrinsic curiosity or stochastic policies without explicit guidance. Further analyses confirm better understanding of environmental structure, reduced entropy in policy weights, and more efficient utilization of data samples during learning. Overall, our results demonstrate significant benefits of using goal-directed exploration strategies tailored to individual agents in RL domains, paving the way towards stronger generalization abilities and improved sample efficiency in practice.",1

"In real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), noise from inherent stochasticity of environments is inevitable. However, current policy evaluation algorithms, which plays a key role in many RL algorithms, are either prone to noise or inefficient. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel policy evaluation algorithm, which we call Gap-increasing RetrAce Policy Evaluation (GRAPE). It leverages two recent ideas: (1) gap-increasing value update operators in advantage learning for noise-tolerance and (2) off-policy eligibility trace in Retrace algorithm for efficient learning. We provide detailed theoretical analysis of the new algorithm that shows its efficiency and noise-tolerance inherited from Retrace and advantage learning. Furthermore, our analysis shows that GRAPE's learning is significantly efficient than that of a simple learning-rate-based approach while keeping the same level of noise-tolerance. We applied GRAPE to control problems and obtained experimental results supporting our theoretical analysis.",0

In addition, we demonstrate how our method can effectively handle complex environments containing high levels of uncertainty, making it well suited for real-world applications where accurate behavior prediction is crucial. By providing efficient and noise-tolerant policy evaluation, we believe our work represents an important contribution towards advancing RL research and development.",1
"The growing interest in both the automation of machine learning and deep learning has inevitably led to the development of a wide variety of automated methods for neural architecture search. The choice of the network architecture has proven to be critical, and many advances in deep learning spring from its immediate improvements.

"Abstract: Artificial neural networks have achieved great successes across many domains, such as image recognition, speech processing, natural language understanding, among others. However, designing efficient and accurate neural architectures remains a challenging task due to the vast search space of possible configurations.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of NAS methods proposed in literature. We first introduce foundational concepts underlying modern deep learning approaches and describe how these methods fit into classical algorithmic frameworks. Subsequently, we present recent advances in differentiable neural architecture search, which train neural architectures along with their weights by backpropagation through continuous operations.

"Imitation from observation is the framework of learning tasks by observing demonstrated state-only trajectories. Recently, adversarial approaches have achieved significant performance improvements over other methods for imitating complex behaviors. However, these adversarial imitation algorithms often require many demonstration examples and learning iterations to produce a policy that is successful at imitating a demonstrator's behavior. This high sample complexity often prohibits these algorithms from being deployed on physical robots. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that addresses the sample inefficiency problem by utilizing ideas from trajectory centric reinforcement learning algorithms. We test our algorithm and conduct experiments using an imitation task on a physical robot arm and its simulated version in Gazebo and will show the improvement in learning rate and efficiency.",0
"Advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can perform complex tasks such as image recognition, speech synthesis, and natural language processing.

This study presents an empirical evaluation of SAIL on several benchmark problems, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both sample efficiency and model quality. Our findings suggest that SAIL could potentially reduce the amount of data required to train effective AI models, making it more accessible to researchers and practitioners working with limited data resources. We discuss future directions and implications of our work for advancing AI systems that learn efficiently from observation alone.",1
"We aim to jointly optimize antenna tilt angle, and vertical and horizontal half-power beamwidths of the macrocells in a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet). The interactions between the cells, most notably due to their coupled interference render this optimization prohibitively complex. Utilizing a single agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for this optimization becomes quite suboptimum despite its scalability, whereas multi-agent RL algorithms yield better solutions at the expense of scalability. Hence, we propose a compromise algorithm between these two. Specifically, a multi-agent mean field RL algorithm is first utilized in the offline phase so as to transfer information as features for the second (online) phase single agent RL algorithm, which employs a deep neural network to learn users locations. This two-step approach is a practical solution for real deployments, which should automatically adapt to environmental changes in the network. Our results illustrate that the proposed algorithm approaches the performance of the multi-agent RL, which requires millions of trials, with hundreds of online trials, assuming relatively low environmental dynamics, and performs much better than a single agent RL. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compact and implementable, and empirically appears to provide a performance guarantee regardless of the amount of environmental dynamics.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in online antenna tuning as a means of improving system performance and efficiency in heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). This approach involves dynamically adjusting antenna parameters based on real-time network conditions, rather than relying on predefined settings that may no longer be optimal. One promising technique for online antenna tuning in HCNs is deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which allows agents to learn and optimize complex tasks through trial-and-error interactions with their environments. Despite the potential benefits of DRL-based antenna tuning schemes, however, there remain significant challenges related to model training, exploration-exploitation tradeoffs, scalability, and adaptability across diverse network scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for online antenna tuning using multiagent actorcritic DRL algorithms, enhanced by memory-augmented neural networks and attention mechanisms. We evaluate our scheme via extensive simulations of dense urban and rural HCNs, considering different deployment scenarios such as massive MIMO systems, millimetre wave communications, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations, and nonlineof-sight channels. Our results demonstrate up to 27% gains in network capacity compared to static antenna configurations while maintaining robustness under varying network conditions.

"This paper presents novel mixed-type Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms to accelerate the optimization of a target objective function by exploiting correlated auxiliary information of binary type that can be more cheaply obtained, such as in policy search for reinforcement learning and hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models with early stopping. To achieve this, we first propose a mixed-type multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) to jointly model the continuous target function and binary auxiliary functions. Then, we propose information-based acquisition functions such as mixed-type entropy search (MT-ES) and mixed-type predictive ES (MT-PES) for mixed-type BO based on the MOGP predictive belief of the target and auxiliary functions. The exact acquisition functions of MT-ES and MT-PES cannot be computed in closed form and need to be approximated. We derive an efficient approximation of MT-PES via a novel mixed-type random features approximation of the MOGP model whose cross-correlation structure between the target and auxiliary functions can be exploited for improving the belief of the global target maximizer using observations from evaluating these functions. We propose new practical constraints to relate the global target maximizer to the binary auxiliary functions. We empirically evaluate the performance of MT-ES and MT-PES with synthetic and real-world experiments.",0
"This work presents a new variant of probabilistically robust optimization called ""Bayesian optimization with binary auxiliary information"" (BOA). BOA extends classical Bayesian optimization by adding binary auxiliary variables that provide additional information about the objective function and constraint functions at each iteration. These auxiliary variables can be used to encode additional prior knowledge such as bounds on variable ranges, problem structure or constraints that simplify the evaluation of objectives. We show how BOA can use these auxiliary variables to generate more informative surrogate models and reduce reliance on noisy evaluations from the true objective. Numerical results demonstrate improved performance over standard methods on several benchmark problems with different degrees of difficulty.",1
"We propose a lifelong learning architecture, the Neural Computer Agent (NCA), where a Reinforcement Learning agent is paired with a predictive model of the environment learned by a Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC). The agent and DNC model are trained in conjunction iteratively. The agent improves its policy in simulations generated by the DNC model and rolls out the policy to the live environment, collecting experiences in new portions or tasks of the environment for further learning. Experiments in two synthetic environments show that DNC models can continually learn from pixels alone to simulate new tasks as they are encountered by the agent, while the agents can be successfully trained to solve the tasks using Proximal Policy Optimization entirely in simulations.",0
"This article presents iterative model-based reinforcement learning using simulations within the differentiable neural computer (DNC). In order to improve the agent’s decision making process, we consider using simulation-based estimates of expected returns, which can then be used as training data within the DNC system. We introduce two iterative methods: the first method uses policy improvement based on model predictions of returns, while the second method uses policy iteration to find better policies directly from estimated values. Our results show that both approaches lead to improved policies over multiple iterations, even without access to real world interactions. Additionally, our analysis shows that policy evaluation from simulated trajectories often outperforms evaluation from random rollouts. Overall, our work suggests that model-based reinforcement learning using simulations may provide a promising direction for improving generalization of agents trained within the DNC framework. ----- This study explores iterative model-based reinforcement learning utilizing simulations inside the differentiable neural computer (DNC). With the goal of enhancing the agent’s decision-making procedure, we take into account using simulation-based approximations of anticipated rewards, which can then function as preparation info within the DNC architecture. Two iterative techniques have been developed: the initial approach makes use of policy renovation determined by design forecasts of returns, while the second technique employs policy iteration to identify more effective plans straight from calculated benefits. Experimentation outcomes demonstrate that both techniques generate superior strategies across several iterations, regardless of restricted accessibility to actual environment interventions. Moreover, our examination reveals that policy appraisal derived from simulated paths generally surpasses assessment via arbitrary rollouts. Generally speaking, our research proposes that model-based reinforce learning employing simulations might constitute a beneficial direction for bettering specialized execution of brokers instructed throughout the DNC construction. -----",1
"We propose a method for tackling catastrophic forgetting in deep reinforcement learning that is \textit{agnostic} to the timescale of changes in the distribution of experiences, does not require knowledge of task boundaries, and can adapt in \textit{continuously} changing environments. In our \textit{policy consolidation} model, the policy network interacts with a cascade of hidden networks that simultaneously remember the agent's policy at a range of timescales and regularise the current policy by its own history, thereby improving its ability to learn without forgetting. We find that the model improves continual learning relative to baselines on a number of continuous control tasks in single-task, alternating two-task, and multi-agent competitive self-play settings.",0
"Title: ""Policy Consolidation for Continual Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to policy consolidation that enables continual reinforcement learning agents to learn and retain multiple policies over time. Existing methods typically suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learned knowledge is quickly forgotten after training on new tasks.

Through extensive experiments across various domains, we demonstrate our method significantly outperforms strong baselines by achieving better overall performance across all tasks and improved retention of previously learned policies. Our results highlight the importance of effective policy consolidation strategies in enabling lifelong machine learning.",1
"Curriculum learning is often employed in deep reinforcement learning to let the agent progress more quickly towards better behaviors. Numerical methods for curriculum learning in the literature provides only initial heuristic solutions, with little to no guarantee on their quality. We define a new gray-box function that, including a suitable scheduling problem, can be effectively used to reformulate the curriculum learning problem. We propose different efficient numerical methods to address this gray-box reformulation. Preliminary numerical results on a benchmark task in the curriculum learning literature show the viability of the proposed approach.",0
"""Abstract"":  This paper presents a new method for automatic curriculum generation based on a combination of human-designed tasks and machine-generated ones. We call our approach “gray box” because we use both explicit instruction (teaching) from humans as well as implicit feedback from students' performance on different types of problems. Our model uses a novel attention mechanism that learns to focus on important parts of each problem while generating subsequent ones. Experimental results show improved student performance over prior methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our grey-box approach for automating instructional design.  ""Gray-Box Approach for Automatic Curriculum Learning"":  In education, creating effective lesson plans requires expertise in pedagogy, subject matter knowledge, and time.

Inspired by principles of active learning, our model generates personalized sequences of tasks tailored to individual learners’ needs. Our algorithm utilizes both instructor input through teaching prompts and learner data via student responses during training. This allows our model to exploit both explicit instruction and implicit feedback to optimize its generated curricula. The proposed solution features a multi-objective learning paradigm designed to balance multiple desiderata including content coverage, task difficulty adjustments, and user engagement. Experimental evaluation shows that our gray-box approach outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and metrics, suggesting significant benefits of automating instructional design processes.",1
"Stochastic approximation (SA) is a key method used in statistical learning. Recently, its non-asymptotic convergence analysis has been considered in many papers. However, most of the prior analyses are made under restrictive assumptions such as unbiased gradient estimates and convex objective function, which significantly limit their applications to sophisticated tasks such as online and reinforcement learning. These restrictions are all essentially relaxed in this work. In particular, we analyze a general SA scheme to minimize a non-convex, smooth objective function. We consider update procedure whose drift term depends on a state-dependent Markov chain and the mean field is not necessarily of gradient type, covering approximate second-order method and allowing asymptotic bias for the one-step updates. We illustrate these settings with the online EM algorithm and the policy-gradient method for average reward maximization in reinforcement learning.",0
"This paper presents an analysis of non-asymptotic properties of biased stochastic approximation schemes (BSASs). BSASs have been widely used in many fields such as computer science, engineering, economics, and finance due to their simplicity and robustness. However, despite their popularity, little attention has been paid to their non-asymptotic behavior, especially when the step size goes to zero. In this study, we provide new insights into the finite-time performance of BSASs by investigating both ergodic and nonergodic settings under different assumptions on the underlying function and noise sequence. Our results reveal that the bias plays a critical role in shaping the convergence rate and accuracy of the algorithms. We also propose novel correction techniques that significantly improve the quality of approximations in certain cases where traditional BSASs fail to converge or produce accurate solutions. Overall, our findings offer valuable guidance for choosing appropriate BSASs in real-world applications. They also open up exciting opportunities for future research directions that extend beyond BSASs but retain some of their appealing features, such as stability guarantees, adaptability, and low computational complexity.",1
"Heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing, Concorde, and METIS are effective and widely used approaches to find solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. However, they are limited by the high sample complexity required to reach a reasonable solution from a cold-start. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to generate better initial solutions for heuristic algorithms using reinforcement learning (RL), named RLHO. We augment the ability of heuristic algorithms to greedily improve upon an existing initial solution generated by RL, and demonstrate novel results where RL is able to leverage the performance of heuristics as a learning signal to generate better initialization.   We apply this framework to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Simulated Annealing (SA). We conduct a series of experiments on the well-known NP-complete bin packing problem, and show that the RLHO method outperforms our baselines. We show that on the bin packing problem, RL can learn to help heuristics perform even better, allowing us to combine the best parts of both approaches.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to solve combinatorial optimization problems. RL algorithms have the potential to quickly identify near-optimal solutions by iteratively adjusting their policy based on feedback from the environment. This feedback can take the form of rewards received for selecting certain actions or penalties incurred due to suboptimal choices.  In this work, we present a novel approach that combines heuristic search methods with RL algorithms to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Our method, called ""Reinforcement Learning Driven Heuristic Optimization"" (RLDHO), uses a deep neural network as its policy function and leverages Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for efficient exploration of the solution space.  We evaluate our method on several benchmark CSP instances and compare its performance against state-of-the-art solvers such as minconflicts, gbu2, and ldom\_branch. Results show that RLDHO outperforms these solvers across different problem sizes and domains, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining RL with heuristic search techniques. Moreover, since MCTS allows for selective decompositions, RLDHO is capable of efficiently exploiting structural properties of individual constraints while maintaining strong branching rules.  Our findings suggest that RL-based approaches have great potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently, particularly when combined with effective heuristics like those used in modern CSP solvers. Further improvements could potentially be achieved through better feature representations, more advanced training criteria, and hybridization with other complementary methods.",1
"Human ability at solving complex tasks is helped by priors on object and event semantics of their environment. This paper investigates the use of similar prior knowledge for transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning agents. In particular, the paper proposes to use a first-order-logic language grounded in deep neural networks to represent facts about objects and their semantics in the real world. Facts are provided as background knowledge a priori to learning a policy for how to act in the world. The priors are injected with the conventional input in a single agent architecture. As proof-of-concept, the paper tests the system in simple experiments that show the importance of symbolic abstraction and flexible fact derivation. The paper shows that the proposed system can learn to take advantage of both the symbolic layer and the image layer in a single decision selection module.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to incorporating prior knowledge into transfer learning for reinforcement learning algorithms through the use of logic tensor networks (LTN). LTN has been shown to be effective at capturing and representing complex relationships between variables, making it well suited for handling the intricate dependencies that exist in many real world problems. By leveraging this capability, we propose a framework for injecting domain expertise directly into the decision making process of existing RL algorithms, improving their ability to quickly learn new tasks while still benefiting from previously acquired experience. Our method employs LTN to model temporal abstraction of states and policies which can then be used by an RL algorithm to effectively utilize both old experiences and newly collected data. We evaluate our approach on a suite of challenging benchmark environments and show significant improvements over baseline models trained without any form of transfer learning or prior knowledge injection. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across different levels of prior knowledge availability. Overall, our work highlights the utility of incorporating rich domain insights in the design of deep learning systems for sequential decision making problems.",1
"We develop a framework for interacting with uncertain environments in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging preferences in the form of utility functions. We claim that there is value in considering different risk measures during learning. In this framework, the preference for risk can be tuned by variation of the parameter $\beta$ and the resulting behavior can be risk-averse, risk-neutral or risk-taking depending on the parameter choice. We evaluate our framework for learning problems with model uncertainty. We measure and control for \emph{epistemic} risk using dynamic programming (DP) and policy gradient-based algorithms. The risk-averse behavior is then compared with the behavior of the optimal risk-neutral policy in environments with epistemic risk.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle high-stakes decision making problems where uncertainty and potential unknown unknowns play a significant role. This work presents one such approach: epistemic risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (ERSRL). Our proposed method extends traditional approaches by explicitly modeling and managing epistemic risks associated with uncertain environmental dynamics. By using risk measures based on deep neural networks trained on expert demonstrations, ERSRL balances maximizing expected returns against minimizing the impact of unexpected outcomes arising from epistemic uncertainties. Through simulations and empirical evaluations across multiple domains, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in situations involving significant levels of complexity and uncertainty.",1
"Real-world applications require RL algorithms to act safely. During learning process, it is likely that the agent executes sub-optimal actions that may lead to unsafe/poor states of the system. Exploration is particularly brittle in high-dimensional state/action space due to increased number of low-performing actions. In this work, we consider risk-averse exploration in approximate RL setting. To ensure safety during learning, we propose the distributionally robust policy iteration scheme that provides lower bound guarantee on state-values. Our approach induces a dynamic level of risk to prevent poor decisions and yet preserves the convergence to the optimal policy. Our formulation results in a efficient algorithm that accounts for a simple re-weighting of policy actions in the standard policy iteration scheme. We extend our approach to continuous state/action space and present a practical algorithm, distributionally robust soft actor-critic, that implements a different exploration strategy: it acts conservatively at short-term and it explores optimistically in a long-run. We provide promising experimental results on continuous control tasks.",0

"Importance-weighted risk minimization is a key ingredient in many machine learning algorithms for causal inference, domain adaptation, class imbalance, and off-policy reinforcement learning. While the effect of importance weighting is well-characterized for low-capacity misspecified models, little is known about how it impacts over-parameterized, deep neural networks. This work is inspired by recent theoretical results showing that on (linearly) separable data, deep linear networks optimized by SGD learn weight-agnostic solutions, prompting us to ask, for realistic deep networks, for which many practical datasets are separable, what is the effect of importance weighting? We present the surprising finding that while importance weighting impacts models early in training, its effect diminishes over successive epochs. Moreover, while L2 regularization and batch normalization (but not dropout), restore some of the impact of importance weighting, they express the effect via (seemingly) the wrong abstraction: why should practitioners tweak the L2 regularization, and by how much, to produce the correct weighting effect? Our experiments confirm these findings across a range of architectures and datasets.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on various tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, among others. One key component that contributes to the success of deep learning models is importance weighting, which involves assigning different weights to each sample in the training set based on their relative importance. This paper investigates the effect of importance weighting in deep learning by analyzing several real-world datasets. Our experiments show that using importance weighting leads to significant improvements in accuracy compared to traditional uniform sampling without any change in model architecture. Furthermore, we analyze how different choices of importance functions affect the performance of the trained models. These findings contribute new insights into understanding the behavior of deep learning models under various sampling regimes, and have important implications for developing more effective algorithms for many applications.

"Efficient exploration is an unsolved problem in Reinforcement Learning which is usually addressed by reactively rewarding the agent for fortuitously encountering novel situations. This paper introduces an efficient active exploration algorithm, Model-Based Active eXploration (MAX), which uses an ensemble of forward models to plan to observe novel events. This is carried out by optimizing agent behaviour with respect to a measure of novelty derived from the Bayesian perspective of exploration, which is estimated using the disagreement between the futures predicted by the ensemble members. We show empirically that in semi-random discrete environments where directed exploration is critical to make progress, MAX is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than strong baselines. MAX scales to high-dimensional continuous environments where it builds task-agnostic models that can be used for any downstream task.",0
"Inspired by research on human learning behavior, model-based active exploration (MAE) allows autonomous agents to actively seek out new experiences and acquire knowledge about their environment through experimentation. MAE uses prior beliefs, represented as probabilistic models, to make predictions that guide the agent towards informative actions.

Successful implementations have shown substantial improvements over passive methods of data collection, while exhibiting robustness across varying environmental conditions and initial ignorance.",1
"In a discounted reward Markov Decision Process (MDP), the objective is to find the optimal value function, i.e., the value function corresponding to an optimal policy. This problem reduces to solving a functional equation known as the Bellman equation and a fixed point iteration scheme known as the value iteration is utilized to obtain the solution. In literature, a successive over-relaxation based value iteration scheme is proposed to speed-up the computation of the optimal value function. The speed-up is achieved by constructing a modified Bellman equation that ensures faster convergence to the optimal value function. However, in many practical applications, the model information is not known and we resort to Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to obtain optimal policy and value function. One such popular algorithm is Q-learning. In this paper, we propose Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Q-learning. We first derive a modified fixed point iteration for SOR Q-values and utilize stochastic approximation to derive a learning algorithm to compute the optimal value function and an optimal policy. We then prove the almost sure convergence of the SOR Q-learning to SOR Q-values. Finally, through numerical experiments, we show that SOR Q-learning is faster compared to the standard Q-learning algorithm.",0
"One approach used in reinforcement learning algorithms is Q-learning, which calculates the expected future reward by making decisions based on current state-action values (Q-values). Successive over relaxation (SOR) can be applied to improve convergence rates in Q-learning by iteratively updating Q-values in proportion to their estimated magnitude of change. This paper presents a new method called successive over relaxation Q-learning that combines SOR with Q-learning, enabling more efficient exploration of the action space while reducing oscillations and speeding up convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performance of this algorithm compared to traditional Q-learning methods in several benchmark problems, including grid worlds and predator-prey scenarios. The results show that successive over relaxation Q-learning provides better stability, faster convergence, and higher overall accuracy in finding optimal policies.",1
"We present SmartChoices, an approach to making machine learning (ML) a first class citizen in programming languages which we see as one way to lower the entrance cost to applying ML to problems in new domains. There is a growing divide in approaches to building systems: on the one hand, programming leverages human experts to define a system while on the other hand behavior is learned from data in machine learning. We propose to hybridize these two by providing a 3-call API which we expose through an object called SmartChoice. We describe the SmartChoices-interface, how it can be used in programming with minimal code changes, and demonstrate that it is an easy to use but still powerful tool by demonstrating improvements over not using ML at all on three algorithmic problems: binary search, QuickSort, and caches. In these three examples, we replace the commonly used heuristics with an ML model entirely encapsulated within a SmartChoice and thus requiring minimal code changes. As opposed to previous work applying ML to algorithmic problems, our proposed approach does not require to drop existing implementations but seamlessly integrates into the standard software development workflow and gives full control to the software developer over how ML methods are applied. Our implementation relies on standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To learn faster, we use the heuristic function, which they are replacing, as an initial function. We show how this initial function can be used to speed up and stabilize learning while providing a safety net that prevents performance to become substantially worse -- allowing for a safe deployment in critical applications in real life.",0

We demonstrate our approach using several examples to showcase how SmartChoices outperforms existing methods by providing more accurate results quickly.",1
"We model human decision-making behaviors in a risk-taking task using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for the purposes of understanding real human decision making under risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying IRL to reveal the implicit reward function in human risk-taking decision making and to interpret risk-prone and risk-averse decision-making policies. We hypothesize that the state history (e.g. rewards and decisions in previous trials) are related to the human reward function, which leads to risk-averse and risk-prone decisions. We design features that reflect these factors in the reward function of IRL and learn the corresponding weight that is interpretable as the importance of features. The results confirm the sub-optimal risk-related decisions of human-driven by the personalized reward function. In particular, the risk-prone person tends to decide based on the current pump number, while the risk-averse person relies on burst information from the previous trial and the average end status. Our results demonstrate that IRL is an effective tool to model human decision-making behavior, as well as to help interpret the human psychological process in risk decision-making.",0
"This research proposes using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as a method for modeling human risk decision making in real-world scenarios. IRL allows for the analysis of behavior by inferring the underlying reward function that drives the agent's decisions. By applying IRL to human decision-making data, we can gain insights into how individuals perceive and evaluate different types of risks and their associated uncertainties. Furthermore, this approach enables us to build interpretable models that capture important factors that influence these perceptions and evaluations. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of using IRL to better understand human risk decision-making processes in real-world contexts. We present empirical results showing that our IRL models accurately predict human choices in a variety of simulated tasks, highlighting the promise of this framework for advancing theories of judgment and decision-making under uncertainty. Overall, our findings contribute new insights into human risk preferences and support the use of machine learning techniques such as IRL as valuable tools for studying complex human behaviors.",1
"Curriculum learning in reinforcement learning is used to shape exploration by presenting the agent with increasingly complex tasks. The idea of curriculum learning has been largely applied in both animal training and pedagogy. In reinforcement learning, all previous task sequencing methods have shaped exploration with the objective of reducing the time to reach a given performance level. We propose novel uses of curriculum learning, which arise from choosing different objective functions. Furthermore, we define a general optimization framework for task sequencing and evaluate the performance of popular metaheuristic search methods on several tasks. We show that curriculum learning can be successfully used to: improve the initial performance, take fewer suboptimal actions during exploration, and discover better policies.",0
"In curriculum learning, task sequencing plays a crucial role in determining the overall effectiveness of the learning process. One approach to optimizing task sequencing is through the use of mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming (LP) and mixed integer programming (MIP). These methods can generate optimized sequences that minimize certain objective functions while taking into account constraints on the order and number of tasks. However, these approaches often suffer from high computational complexity and may not provide realistic solutions in practice due to their reliance on exact formulations and solution algorithms. As a result, there has been recent interest in developing alternative optimization frameworks that strike a balance between computational efficiency and practicality. This paper presents one such framework based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which allows for efficient iteration over candidate task sequences and provides flexibility in terms of modeling different objectives and constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve significant improvements in performance compared to baseline strategies for both synthetic and real-world datasets, making it well suited for practitioners working with large-scale curricula. Overall, this research contributes new insights into the design and implementation of effective task sequencing in curriculum learning settings, addressing a critical need in modern education technology.",1
"Curriculum learning has been successfully used in reinforcement learning to accelerate the learning process, through knowledge transfer between tasks of increasing complexity. Critical tasks, in which suboptimal exploratory actions must be minimized, can benefit from curriculum learning, and its ability to shape exploration through transfer. We propose a task sequencing algorithm maximizing the cumulative return, that is, the return obtained by the agent across all the learning episodes. By maximizing the cumulative return, the agent not only aims at achieving high rewards as fast as possible, but also at doing so while limiting suboptimal actions. We experimentally compare our task sequencing algorithm to several popular metaheuristic algorithms for combinatorial optimization, and show that it achieves significantly better performance on the problem of cumulative return maximization. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm on a critical task, optimizing a home controller for a micro energy grid.",0
"Title: Probabilistic Guided Exploration via Self-Supervised Task Scheduling Objective: This research presents a novel method for guiding exploration during reinforcement learning that utilizes probabilistic modeling techniques to dynamically select task schedules for self-supervised learning. Methods: We propose using probability distributions over possible next states as predictors of future return to guide exploratory behavior. By maximizing mutual information between learned state representations and these predicted returns, we can encourage agents to sample more informative trajectories, ultimately leading to higher cumulative reward. Results: Our experimental results across several continuous control domains demonstrate significant improvements in agent performance compared to previous methods that rely on heuristics or assume knowledge of transition dynamics. Conclusions: These findings suggest that our approach provides a general framework for efficient learning through informed exploration, which could have implications beyond deep reinforcement learning. Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to achieve high levels of performance across many domains; however, finding an optimal policy often requires millions of interactions with the environment. To address this challenge, efficient exploration strategies are critical, and recent work has focused on improving sampling efficiency by designing better ways of exploring the space of actions. In contrast, less attention has been paid to improving the quality of individual experiences themselves. We propose a new approach called Probabilistic Guided Exploration (PGE) that learns how to efficiently explore based on the expected value of each action selection. Specifically, PGE estimates a distribution over future returns given the current state and available actions, allowing agents to focus their exploration towards more promising regions of the state space. Our experiments show that this leads to improved policy convergence rates and overall better final policies. Further analysis reveals t hat PGE tends to schedule tasks at locations where unpredictability is high but feasibility remains intact under the estimated uncertainty. Overall, our contributions provide insight into how to improve both the quantity and quality of data generated for reinforcement learning agents.",1
"Continuous action policy search is currently the focus of intensive research, driven both by the recent success of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and the emergence of competitors based on evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we present a broad survey of policy search methods, providing a unified perspective on very different approaches, including also Bayesian Optimization and directed exploration methods. The main message of this overview is in the relationship between the families of methods, but we also outline some factors underlying sample efficiency properties of the various approaches.",0
"Effective search algorithms have been essential in guiding policy iteration towards success in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In continuous action domains, these algorithms face several challenges due to high dimensional state spaces, uncountably infinite action spaces and delayed gratification, which require efficient exploration strategies that trade off between exploiting knowledge gained from previous iterations and expanding the search space through novel experiences. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of policy search methods that are relevant to continuous action domains. We categorize existing approaches based on their underlying paradigms - model-based planning, direct function approximation and deep learning. For each category, we explain key concepts, theoretical properties as well as discuss representative applications in RL problems with continuous actions spaces such as locomotion control and robotics manipulation tasks. We emphasise how different algorithmic components contribute towards effective solutions in terms of computational complexity, sample efficiency and adaptivity in dynamic environments. Our goal is to provide readers with a solid foundation upon which they can develop more advanced techniques tailored to specific problem classes within the general framework of policy search in continuous action domains.",1
"Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the state-action space is large. A common practice is to parameterize the high-dimensional value and policy functions using given features. However existing methods either have no theoretical guarantee or suffer a regret that is exponential in the planning horizon $H$. In this paper, we propose an online RL algorithm, namely the MatrixRL, that leverages ideas from linear bandit to learn a low-dimensional representation of the probability transition model while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff. We show that MatrixRL achieves a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2d\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$ where $d$ is the number of features. MatrixRL has an equivalent kernelized version, which is able to work with an arbitrary kernel Hilbert space without using explicit features. In this case, the kernelized MatrixRL satisfies a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2\widetilde{d}\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$, where $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of the kernel space. To our best knowledge, for RL using features or kernels, our results are the first regret bounds that are near-optimal in time $T$ and dimension $d$ (or $\widetilde{d}$) and polynomial in the planning horizon $H$.",0
"In this work, we propose a novel framework for reinforcement learning in high-dimensional feature spaces using matrix bandits. We introduce a new algorithm called ""FeatureKernelBandit,"" which combines kernel methods and multi-armed bandit techniques to efficiently learn optimal policies in large feature spaces. Our approach leverages kernel embeddings to map high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space where standard bandit algorithms can operate effectively. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of settings. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis of the regret bounds achievable by FeatureKernelBandit, showing its efficiency in exploring complex feature spaces. This work addresses key challenges faced in deploying advanced RL algorithms in real-world applications, paving the way for improved performance in domains such as online advertising, recommendation systems, and robotics.",1
"Reinforcement learning algorithms struggle when the reward signal is very sparse. In these cases, naive random exploration methods essentially rely on a random walk to stumble onto a rewarding state. Recent works utilize intrinsic motivation to guide the exploration via generative models, predictive forward models, or discriminative modeling of novelty. We propose EMI, which is an exploration method that constructs embedding representation of states and actions that does not rely on generative decoding of the full observation but extracts predictive signals that can be used to guide exploration based on forward prediction in the representation space. Our experiments show competitive results on challenging locomotion tasks with continuous control and on image-based exploration tasks with discrete actions on Atari. The source code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/EMI .",0
"This abstract aims at summarizing the key ideas behind our proposed method for exploratory data analysis using mutual information (EMI). Our approach builds upon recent advances on the frontiers of efficient nonlinear dimensionality reduction, generative models, and active learning methods, adapting them into a modular framework that allows researchers to iteratively refine their understanding of complex datasets through flexible interactivity. At each iteration of the EMI pipeline, users receive a focused visual summary highlighting regions of high variability across all dimensions; they can then provide feedback on salient features they wish to investigate further. We demonstrate applications of our framework towards multiple tasks: finding hidden factors present in large collections of images, analyzing patterns among geospatial time series data representing movement of animals and vehicles, uncovering shared structures between chemical compounds, and identifying novel correlations between genes involved in molecular signaling pathways. In our experiments, we find that compared against standard methods such as PCA and tSNE, EMI leads to superior performance due to its ability to flexibly search for structure under diverse user queries while maintaining efficiency and scalability even when processing millions of observations. By introducing EMI as a powerful tool for discovering intricate relationships within massive amounts of data, we hope to facilitate more insightful scientific inquiry by making it easier for experts from diverse domains to collaborate effectively with machine learning specialists.",1
"Many AI problems, in robotics and other domains, are goal-directed, essentially seeking a trajectory leading to some goal state. In such problems, the way we choose to represent a trajectory underlies algorithms for trajectory prediction and optimization. Interestingly, most all prior work in imitation and reinforcement learning builds on a sequential trajectory representation -- calculating the next state in the trajectory given its predecessors. We propose a different perspective: a goal-conditioned trajectory can be represented by first selecting an intermediate state between start and goal, partitioning the trajectory into two. Then, recursively, predicting intermediate points on each sub-segment, until a complete trajectory is obtained. We call this representation a sub-goal tree, and building on it, we develop new methods for trajectory prediction, learning, and optimization. We show that in a supervised learning setting, sub-goal trees better account for trajectory variability, and can predict trajectories exponentially faster at test time by leveraging a concurrent computation. Then, for optimization, we derive a new dynamic programming equation for sub-goal trees, and use it to develop new planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. These algorithms, which are not based on the standard Bellman equation, naturally account for hierarchical sub-goal structure in a task. Empirical results on motion planning domains show that the sub-goal tree framework significantly improves both accuracy and prediction time.",0
"Sub-goal trees can be used as an alternative to traditional kinematic models for trajectory prediction. By factoring a desired path into a tree structure composed of sub-goals, we can optimize trajectories more efficiently than previous approaches while preserving their interpretability. We show that our approach can generate feasible collision-free paths over complex obstacle fields even when initialized from arbitrary poses. Our framework requires no specialized hardware or sensors beyond standard cameras found on most robots today, making it widely applicable across different robot platforms. In addition, we demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms both model predictive control (MPC) based methods, which suffer from computation overhead due to high frequency sampling, and sampling-based motion planners such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), which may find it challenging to return feasible solutions within short time horizons. Furthermore, the generated trajectories have higher success rates compared to other state-of-the-art methods evaluated on six real-world datasets consisting of diverse environments, scenarios, and robot types, including a humanoid walking task. Finally, we present analysis showing how using these sub-goal trees enables improved generalization performance over several benchmarks. Overall, this work offers significant potential benefits towards enabling robust autonomy in unpredictable real-world settings where prior knowledge is limited and efficiency and speed of planning remain critical constraints.",1
"We examine the question of when and how parametric models are most useful in reinforcement learning. In particular, we look at commonalities and differences between parametric models and experience replay. Replay-based learning algorithms share important traits with model-based approaches, including the ability to plan: to use more computation without additional data to improve predictions and behaviour. We discuss when to expect benefits from either approach, and interpret prior work in this context. We hypothesise that, under suitable conditions, replay-based algorithms should be competitive to or better than model-based algorithms if the model is used only to generate fictional transitions from observed states for an update rule that is otherwise model-free. We validated this hypothesis on Atari 2600 video games. The replay-based algorithm attained state-of-the-art data efficiency, improving over prior results with parametric models.",0
"Parametric modeling has become increasingly popular in deep reinforcement learning (RL) due to its ability to handle high-dimensional spaces and continuous actions, as well as its scalability and interpretability. However, there remain several open questions regarding the appropriate use of parametric models in RL. In this work, we aim to provide insights into these questions by investigating the following topics: What are some good indicators that suggest whether a task would benefit from using a parametric model? How can we balance the simplicity of linear functions versus the expressiveness of more flexible nonlinear models? Can we leverage recent advances in function approximation theory to improve the performance of parametric methods? We provide theoretical analysis and empirical results showing how these factors affect parametric model performance in benchmark control tasks, and we demonstrate that incorporating these considerations leads to significant improvements over standard algorithms. Our findings have important implications for designing effective parametric model-based algorithms and shed light on when these approaches should be used in RL problems.",1
"Value-based reinforcement-learning algorithms provide state-of-the-art results in model-free discrete-action settings, and tend to outperform actor-critic algorithms. We argue that actor-critic algorithms are limited by their need for an on-policy critic. We propose Bootstrapped Dual Policy Iteration (BDPI), a novel model-free reinforcement-learning algorithm for continuous states and discrete actions, with an actor and several off-policy critics. Off-policy critics are compatible with experience replay, ensuring high sample-efficiency, without the need for off-policy corrections. The actor, by slowly imitating the average greedy policy of the critics, leads to high-quality and state-specific exploration, which we compare to Thompson sampling. Because the actor and critics are fully decoupled, BDPI is remarkably stable, and unusually robust to its hyper-parameters. BDPI is significantly more sample-efficient than Bootstrapped DQN, PPO, and ACKTR, on discrete, continuous and pixel-based tasks. Source code: https://github.com/vub-ai-lab/bdpi.",0
"Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), sample efficiency refers to how quickly an agent can learn a task by interacting with an environment. In model-free RL algorithms, which use temporally extended actions, learning from limited experience can lead to poor performance due to high variance in Q values estimates. One solution to this problem is using off-policy evaluation methods that estimate value functions based on data obtained from different policies. However, these methods often suffer from additional sources of variability that hinder their ability to make accurate estimations. This study proposes a novel approach called ""Model-Free RL with Off-Policy Critics"" (MFRC) that combines the stability benefits of Q-learning with the more efficient sampling properties of Temporal Difference learning. MFRC uses multiple off-policy critics operating at different temporal resolutions to reduce noise while maintaining fast convergence rates, resulting in improved sample efficiency over previous methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on benchmark problems, including both discrete action spaces and continuous action spaces. Our results show that MFRC achieves faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art model-free RL methods across all tested domains. Additionally, we investigate the impact of varying levels of exploration on the performance of MFRC, highlighting the importance of balancing exploitation and exploration during learning. These findings suggest that MFRC represents a promising direction towards solving challenging real-world control tasks in simulation, making it applicable in areas such as robotics and finance.",1
"The standard reinforcement learning (RL) formulation considers the expectation of the (discounted) cumulative reward. This is limiting in applications where we are concerned with not only the expected performance, but also the distribution of the performance. In this paper, we introduce micro-objective reinforcement learning --- an alternative RL formalism that overcomes this issue. In this new formulation, a RL task is specified by a set of micro-objectives, which are constructs that specify the desirability or undesirability of events. In addition, micro-objectives allow prior knowledge in the form of temporal abstraction to be incorporated into the global RL objective. The generality of this formalism, and its relations to single/multi-objective RL, and hierarchical RL are discussed.",0

"We introduce a unified probabilistic framework for solving sequential decision making problems ranging from Bayesian optimisation to contextual bandits and reinforcement learning. This is accomplished by a probabilistic model-based approach that explains observed data while capturing predictive uncertainty during the decision making process. Crucially, this probabilistic model is chosen to be a Meta-Learning system that allows learning from a distribution of related problems, allowing data efficient adaptation to a target task. As a suitable instantiation of this framework, we explore the use of Neural processes due to statistical and computational desiderata. We apply our framework to a broad range of problem domains, such as control problems, recommender systems and adversarial attacks on RL agents, demonstrating an efficient and general black-box learning approach.",0
"This paper proposes the use of meta-learning techniques to train surrogate models that can accelerate sequential decision making problems. Traditional approaches for training such models require large amounts of data and computation time, which limits their application in practice. However, by leveraging recent advances in meta-learning, we show how to create models that learn more quickly and accurately. Our approach uses a two-level optimization process: the outer loop trains a model on multiple tasks, while the inner loop fine-tunes the hyperparameters using gradient descent. We apply our methodology to several real world scenarios including computer vision and robotics control tasks. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Overall, this research offers a promising new direction for efficient decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Tight estimation of the Lipschitz constant for deep neural networks (DNNs) is useful in many applications ranging from robustness certification of classifiers to stability analysis of closed-loop systems with reinforcement learning controllers. Existing methods in the literature for estimating the Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In this paper, we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of DNNs both accurately and efficiently. Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex potential functions. Hence, they satisfy certain properties that can be described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). The resulting SDP can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation). We illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated networks and on classifiers trained on the MNIST and Iris datasets. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide robustness guarantees.",0

This research proposes a method for efficient and accurate estimation of Lipschitz constants for deep neural networks. We consider the problem of ensuring stability during backpropagation by constraining gradient updates using clipping based on the estimated Lipschitz constant. Our approach leverages recent developments in optimization and machine learning theory to efficiently approximate the worst-case Lipschitz constants of each layer in a feedforward network without explicitly computing Hessians or gradients.

"Multi-agent learning is a promising method to simulate aggregate competitive behaviour in finance. Learning expert agents' reward functions through their external demonstrations is hence particularly relevant for subsequent design of realistic agent-based simulations. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims at acquiring such reward functions through inference, allowing to generalize the resulting policy to states not observed in the past. This paper investigates whether IRL can infer such rewards from agents within real financial stochastic environments: limit order books (LOB). We introduce a simple one-level LOB, where the interactions of a number of stochastic agents and an expert trading agent are modelled as a Markov decision process. We consider two cases for the expert's reward: either a simple linear function of state features; or a complex, more realistic non-linear function. Given the expert agent's demonstrations, we attempt to discover their strategy by modelling their latent reward function using linear and Gaussian process (GP) regressors from previous literature, and our own approach through Bayesian neural networks (BNN). While the three methods can learn the linear case, only the GP-based and our proposed BNN methods are able to discover the non-linear reward case. Our BNN IRL algorithm outperforms the other two approaches as the number of samples increases. These results illustrate that complex behaviours, induced by non-linear reward functions amid agent-based stochastic scenarios, can be deduced through inference, encouraging the use of inverse reinforcement learning for opponent-modelling in multi-agent systems.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to modeling limit order book dynamics using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Traditional models of financial markets rely on the assumption that market participants make rational decisions based on available information, but IRL provides a more flexible framework that allows us to capture behavioral biases and other sources of irrationality in decision making. We apply IRL to simulated data from a realistic trading environment where agents use heuristics rather than perfect optimization algorithms. Our results show that IRL can accurately predict agent behavior even in situations where traditional methods fail, such as in periods of high market volatility. Additionally, we demonstrate how IRL can generate action recommendations that outperform existing approaches based on technical analysis. Overall, our work contributes to a better understanding of financial markets by providing a powerful tool for analyzing complex decision-making processes under uncertainty.",1
"Recent efforts in Machine Learning (ML) interpretability have focused on creating methods for explaining black-box ML models. However, these methods rely on the assumption that simple approximations, such as linear models or decision-trees, are inherently human-interpretable, which has not been empirically tested. Additionally, past efforts have focused exclusively on comprehension, neglecting to explore the trust component necessary to convince non-technical experts, such as clinicians, to utilize ML models in practice. In this paper, we posit that reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn what is interpretable to different users and, consequently, build their trust in ML models. To validate this idea, we first train a neural network to provide risk assessments for heart failure patients. We then design a RL-based clinical decision-support system (DSS) around the neural network model, which can learn from its interactions with users. We conduct an experiment involving a diverse set of clinicians from multiple institutions in three different countries. Our results demonstrate that ML experts cannot accurately predict which system outputs will maximize clinicians' confidence in the underlying neural network model, and suggest additional findings that have broad implications to the future of research into ML interpretability and the use of ML in medicine.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning algorithms to develop decision support systems that can provide accurate and informative predictions. However, many existing models suffer from ""black box"" limitations, where the reasoning behind their decisions remains opaque to users, limiting their trust and adoption. To address these challenges, we propose designing interpretable decision-support systems that can explain how their predictions were derived. We describe a framework for defining interpretability based on transparency, comprehensibility, validity, consistency, stability, and predictive power. We then discuss applications of our approach to healthcare, finance, criminal justice, education, and beyond. Our work demonstrates the value of incorporating human understanding into algorithmic prediction and decision-making processes while ensuring that machine learning remains objective and unbiased. By enhancing user confidence in automated systems, our methods have significant potential impacts across diverse domains.

"The utility of learning a dynamics/world model of the environment in reinforcement learning has been shown in a many ways. When using neural networks, however, these models suffer catastrophic forgetting when learned in a lifelong or continual fashion. Current solutions to the continual learning problem require experience to be segmented and labeled as discrete tasks, however, in continuous experience it is generally unclear what a sufficient segmentation of tasks would be. Here we propose a method to continually learn these internal world models through the interleaving of internally generated episodes of past experiences (i.e., pseudo-rehearsal). We show this method can sequentially learn unsupervised temporal prediction, without task labels, in a disparate set of Atari games. Empirically, this interleaving of the internally generated rollouts with the external environment's observations leads to a consistent reduction in temporal prediction loss compared to non-interleaved learning and is preserved over repeated random exposures to various tasks. Similarly, using a network distillation approach, we show that modern policy gradient based reinforcement learning algorithms can use this internal model to continually learn to optimize reward based on the world model's representation of the environment.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making tremendous progress in recent years due to advancements in deep learning techniques that enable machines to learn from large amounts of data.

"We study Imitation Learning (IL) from Observations alone (ILFO) in large-scale MDPs. While most IL algorithms rely on an expert to directly provide actions to the learner, in this setting the expert only supplies sequences of observations. We design a new model-free algorithm for ILFO, Forward Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which learns a sequence of time-dependent policies by minimizing an Integral Probability Metric between the observation distributions of the expert policy and the learner. FAIL is the first provably efficient algorithm in ILFO setting, which learns a near-optimal policy with a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent of the number of unique observations. The resulting theory extends the domain of provably sample efficient learning algorithms beyond existing results, which typically only consider tabular reinforcement learning settings or settings that require access to a near-optimal reset distribution. We also investigate the extension of FAIL in a model-based setting. Finally we demonstrate the efficacy of FAIL on multiple OpenAI Gym control tasks.",0
"Here's a possible abstract:  In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in many fields, but one of its limitations is that most models require large amounts of labeled data for training. In contrast, humans can often learn new skills by observing others performing them just once or twice. This ability to learn from observation alone without explicit guidance or feedback is known as imitation learning. However, traditional imitation learning algorithms suffer from scalability issues because they typically require multiple iterations of trial and error to achieve good performance, making it difficult to apply them to real-world tasks involving complex environments or behaviors.  To address these challenges, we propose a provably efficient imitation learning algorithm based on policy optimization using variational inference techniques. Our approach learns a stochastic policy directly from observed demonstrations and uses a novel regularization term derived from inverse reinforcement learning to ensure robustness to incomplete or noisy observations. We prove that our method converges faster than previous methods in both simulation and human subjects experiments. Furthermore, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets while requiring less computation time and fewer iterations compared to competing approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our algorithm by applying it to two real-world applications, robotics manipulation and humanoid locomotion control.  Our work represents a significant step towards enabling artificial agents to learn more efficiently from raw sensorimotor input without relying exclusively on supervised learning or extensive domain knowledge. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and rigorous theoretical analysis, we hope to inspire future research aimed at bridging the gap between humanlike adaptive intelligence and current artificial systems.",1
"Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning are concerned with creating decision-making agents which can perform well in various complex domains. A particular approach which has received increasing attention is multi-agent reinforcement learning, in which multiple agents learn concurrently to coordinate their actions. In such multi-agent environments, additional learning problems arise due to the continually changing decision-making policies of agents. This paper surveys recent works that address the non-stationarity problem in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.

"In recent years, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has gained significant attention as a powerful approach for training intelligent agents that can effectively interact with other agents in complex environments. However, one major challenge facing MADRL systems is dealing with non-stationarity, which refers to changes in the environment or behavior of other agents over time. This problem can lead to deteriorating performance or even catastrophic failure of MADRL algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a novel method based on meta-learning that enables MADRL agents to adapt to changing conditions more efficiently. Our approach involves learning a shared policy initialization across tasks, enabling fast adaptation by fine-tuning only a few parameters of each agent's policy during deployment. We evaluate our method using several benchmark multi-agent domains and demonstrate improved stability and robustness against non-stationary environments compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards building more resilient and effective MADRL systems that can operate in dynamic and uncertain real-world settings.",1
"We focus on the problem of teaching a robot to solve tasks presented sequentially, i.e., in a continual learning scenario.

We provide preliminary work on applying Reinforcement Learning to such setting, on 2D navigation tasks for a 3 wheel omni-directional robot. Our approach takes advantage of state representation learning and policy distillation. Policies are trained using learned features as input, rather than raw observations, allowing better sample efficiency. Policy distillation is used to combine multiple policies into a single one that solves all encountered tasks.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly important as a tool for automating decision making processes in a wide range of domains, including robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, and many others.

"Model-based Reinforcement Learning approaches have the promise of being sample efficient. Much of the progress in learning dynamics models in RL has been made by learning models via supervised learning. But traditional model-based approaches lead to `compounding errors' when the model is unrolled step by step. Essentially, the state transitions that the learner predicts (by unrolling the model for multiple steps) and the state transitions that the learner experiences (by acting in the environment) may not be consistent. There is enough evidence that humans build a model of the environment, not only by observing the environment but also by interacting with the environment. Interaction with the environment allows humans to carry out experiments: taking actions that help uncover true causal relationships which can be used for building better dynamics models. Analogously, we would expect such interactions to be helpful for a learning agent while learning to model the environment dynamics. In this paper, we build upon this intuition by using an auxiliary cost function to ensure consistency between what the agent observes (by acting in the real world) and what it imagines (by acting in the `learned' world). We consider several tasks - Mujoco based control tasks and Atari games - and show that the proposed approach helps to train powerful policies and better dynamics models.",0

LPD differs from traditional reinforcement learning methods in two key ways: firstly, it uses forward simulation and model-predictive control (MPC) instead of Q-learning or SARSA; secondly, it relies on a simplified but consistent model, which reduces computational requirements and improves stability while preserving enough expressiveness to capture complex behaviors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LPD substantially outperforms both Q-learning and MPC baselines across diverse environments. Our findings suggest that future advances in deep RL may benefit significantly from incorporating LPD principles. Additionally, we propose several potential applications of our approach to real-world problems such as autonomous robots and adaptive traffic signal systems. By combining simplicity, consistency, and robustness, LPD provides an effective alternative to existing methods for many sequential decision making tasks.",1
"Reinforcement learning has seen great advancements in the past five years. The successful introduction of deep learning in place of more traditional methods allowed reinforcement learning to scale to very complex domains achieving super-human performance in environments like the game of Go or numerous video games. Despite great successes in multiple domains, these new methods suffer from their own issues that make them often inapplicable to the real world problems. Extreme lack of data efficiency, together with huge variance and difficulty in enforcing safety constraints, is one of the three most prominent issues in the field. Usually, millions of data points sampled from the environment are necessary for these algorithms to converge to acceptable policies.   This thesis proposes novel Generative Adversarial Imaginative Reinforcement Learning algorithm. It takes advantage of the recent introduction of highly effective generative adversarial models, and Markov property that underpins reinforcement learning setting, to model dynamics of the real environment within the internal imagination module. Rollouts from the imagination are then used to artificially simulate the real environment in a standard reinforcement learning process to avoid, often expensive and dangerous, trial and error in the real environment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm more economically utilises experience from the real environment than the current state-of-the-art Rainbow DQN algorithm, and thus makes an important step towards sample efficient deep reinforcement learning.",0
"One major challenge in training deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents is the high sample complexity due to interaction cycles involving replay buffer manipulation, policy improvement updates, and model parallelization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new method called generative adversarial imagination (GAIL). GAIL leverages generative models, specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs), as imagination modules that can generate realistic future trajectories under different actions from the current state. In contrast to prior works, which rely on purely random sampling or precomputed rollouts, our approach enables efficient fine-grained control over imagined trajectory diversity and quality through cycle consistency constraints. This allows us to significantly reduce sample requirements while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional RL methods without using large datasets. Our evaluations across several challenging continuous control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework, yielding improvements up to two orders of magnitude less sample complexity than previous methods. We expect our work to lay the foundation for advances in more data-efficient decision making under uncertainty and encourage further exploration into hybrid approaches between powerful deep neural network architectures and classical planning algorithms.",1
"Efficient exploration is a long-standing problem in sensorimotor learning. Major advances have been demonstrated in noise-free, non-stochastic domains such as video games and simulation. However, most of these formulations either get stuck in environments with stochastic dynamics or are too inefficient to be scalable to real robotics setups. In this paper, we propose a formulation for exploration inspired by the work in active learning literature. Specifically, we train an ensemble of dynamics models and incentivize the agent to explore such that the disagreement of those ensembles is maximized. This allows the agent to learn skills by exploring in a self-supervised manner without any external reward. Notably, we further leverage the disagreement objective to optimize the agent's policy in a differentiable manner, without using reinforcement learning, which results in a sample-efficient exploration. We demonstrate the efficacy of this formulation across a variety of benchmark environments including stochastic-Atari, Mujoco and Unity. Finally, we implement our differentiable exploration on a real robot which learns to interact with objects completely from scratch.

"Abstract: In this work we propose a new method based on disagreement learning that significantly reduces labeled data needs while improving performance over fully supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification models such as EfficientNet L2 and EOS. Our method, termed ""disagreement exploration"" (DisE), builds upon recent advances in self-supervised representation learning by framing unlabeled images at different resolutions through the lens of how they lead classifiers into disagreement. To maximize uncertainty among ensembles trained from different views, our method employs curriculum sampling and random projections that learn robust representations across different levels of abstraction. Unlike prior methods based on consistency regularization alone, our novel approach incorporates disagreement minimization constraints directly into training objectives. This leads to substantially better performance than existing self-supervised methods like SimCLRv2, MoCo, BYOL, Barlow Twins, ReMixMatch, etc., with smaller batch sizes and fewer epochs, making it computationally efficient under realistic settings. We also showcase outstanding generalization properties on several benchmark datasets. Our contributions have implications well beyond computer vision where pretraining with limited annotated data remains a bottleneck. End Summary: In summary, we present a new technique called Disagreement Exploration which requires less amount of labelled data but results in better accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms in image recognition tasks such as EfficientNet L2 & EOS. DisE uses two techniques -curriculum sampling and random projection to create diverse viewpoints and ensure maximum variance between these views. Also, unlike prior works which rely heavily on regularisation; our novel approach integrates disagree",1
"We propose CAVIA for meta-learning, a simple extension to MAML that is less prone to meta-overfitting, easier to parallelise, and more interpretable. CAVIA partitions the model parameters into two parts: context parameters that serve as additional input to the model and are adapted on individual tasks, and shared parameters that are meta-trained and shared across tasks. At test time, only the context parameters are updated, leading to a low-dimensional task representation. We show empirically that CAVIA outperforms MAML for regression, classification, and reinforcement learning. Our experiments also highlight weaknesses in current benchmarks, in that the amount of adaptation needed in some cases is small.",0
"In many real world applications, such as autonomous robots, conversational agents or image recognition systems, context adaptation is crucial for achieving high performance. However, current approaches often require large amounts of annotated data specific to each task and environment, which can be expensive and time consuming to collect. This work proposes a novel approach called meta-learning for fast context adapation that significantly reduces these requirements. Our method uses few labeled samples from a new environment to rapidly adapt the model parameters to perform well on unseen examples within that setting. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods across several diverse domains, demonstrating that learning new tasks using very little data is possible without sacrificing accuracy. These results have important implications for improving the generalization ability of machine learning models in real world scenarios where labelled training data may be scarce.",1
"Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is an off-policy actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By combining off-policy updates with an actor-critic formulation, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous-action benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. The off-policy method employed by SAC samples data uniformly from past experience when performing parameter updates. We propose Emphasizing Recent Experience (ERE), a simple but powerful off-policy sampling technique, which emphasizes recently observed data while not forgetting the past. The ERE algorithm samples more aggressively from recent experience, and also orders the updates to ensure that updates from old data do not overwrite updates from new data. We compare vanilla SAC and SAC+ERE, and show that ERE is more sample efficient than vanilla SAC for continuous-action Mujoco tasks. We also consider combining SAC with Priority Experience Replay (PER), a scheme originally proposed for deep Q-learning which prioritizes the data based on temporal-difference (TD) error. We show that SAC+PER can marginally improve the sample efficiency performance of SAC, but much less so than SAC+ERE. Finally, we propose an algorithm which integrates ERE and PER and show that this hybrid algorithm can give the best results for some of the Mujoco tasks.",0
"In many domains, reinforcement learning (RL) agents must learn to make decisions based on their recent experience while still remembering important aspects from the past. One approach that has gained popularity recently is soft actor-critic RL, which combines advantage actor-critic algorithms with off-policy methods like importance sampling to balance memory of old experiences against current focus on new ones. However, existing implementations may sacrifice either prioritization of older memories or effective use of more recent data at different timescales. This work introduces boosted soft Q-learning (BSQ), an extension of boosted decision trees (BDTs) that learns online with a weight update similar to trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Experimental evaluation across continuous control benchmarks demonstrates BSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TRPO while matching its ability to preserve past knowledge. Additionally, we present analysis revealing how the learned tree structure changes over time as agent performance improves. The work suggests that careful consideration of both immediate rewards and past experience via appropriate regularizations leads to improved results even beyond the strong performance of previous approaches.",1
"To be successful in real-world tasks, Reinforcement Learning (RL) needs to exploit the compositional, relational, and hierarchical structure of the world, and learn to transfer it to the task at hand. Recent advances in representation learning for language make it possible to build models that acquire world knowledge from text corpora and integrate this knowledge into downstream decision making problems. We thus argue that the time is right to investigate a tight integration of natural language understanding into RL in particular. We survey the state of the field, including work on instruction following, text games, and learning from textual domain knowledge. Finally, we call for the development of new environments as well as further investigation into the potential uses of recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for such tasks.",0
"This article provides a survey of recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) that have been informed by natural language processing (NLP). RL has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence, enabling agents to learn from trial and error by maximizing cumulative reward. However, many real-world tasks require more than just raw optimization - they demand rich representations and interactions with human users who may lack domain expertise but can provide crucial guidance through natural language feedback. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques that blend NLP and RL towards creating intelligent agents that can engage with humans in naturally expressive ways: from instruction following and question answering to contingency management and conversationally guided problem solving. Our review focuses on four key aspects that arise in these endeavors: instruction interpretation, exploration-exploitation tradeoffs, adaptivity and robustness, and meta-learning from multiple interaction threads. By tracing connections across different work streams within both NLP and RL communities, we aim to foster collaboration and encourage progress along converging paths.",1
"Network slicing promises to provision diversified services with distinct requirements in one infrastructure. Deep reinforcement learning (e.g., deep $\mathcal{Q}$-learning, DQL) is assumed to be an appropriate algorithm to solve the demand-aware inter-slice resource management issue in network slicing by regarding the varying demands and the allocated bandwidth as the environment state and the action, respectively. However, allocating bandwidth in a finer resolution usually implies larger action space, and unfortunately DQL fails to quickly converge in this case. In this paper, we introduce discrete normalized advantage functions (DNAF) into DQL, by separating the $\mathcal{Q}$-value function as a state-value function term and an advantage term and exploiting a deterministic policy gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to avoid the unnecessary calculation of $\mathcal{Q}$-value for every state-action pair. Furthermore, as DPGD only works in continuous action space, we embed a k-nearest neighbor algorithm into DQL to quickly find a valid action in the discrete space nearest to the DPGD output. Finally, we verify the faster convergence of the DNAF-based DQL through extensive simulations.",0
"In this work we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for optimizing resource management in network slicing environments. We introduce discrete normalized advantage functions (DNAF), which provide a compact, efficient representation of return values suitable for use in policy gradient methods. Our method learns to select actions that optimize a reward function derived from network slice quality objectives such as latency, throughput and reliability. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms across varying scales and scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies using DNAF for QoS-aware resource allocation problems in network slicing, paving the way for future research into more advanced model architectures and hyperparameter optimization techniques.",1
"Humans tend to learn complex abstract concepts faster if examples are presented in a structured manner. For instance, when learning how to play a board game, usually one of the first concepts learned is how the game ends, i.e. the actions that lead to a terminal state (win, lose or draw). The advantage of learning end-games first is that once the actions which lead to a terminal state are understood, it becomes possible to incrementally learn the consequences of actions that are further away from a terminal state - we call this an end-game-first curriculum. Currently the state-of-the-art machine learning player for general board games, AlphaZero by Google DeepMind, does not employ a structured training curriculum; instead learning from the entire game at all times. By employing an end-game-first training curriculum to train an AlphaZero inspired player, we empirically show that the rate of learning of an artificial player can be improved during the early stages of training when compared to a player not using a training curriculum.",0
"This may sound like a daunting task at first but writing an abstract can be broken down into several steps which makes it easier. First we need to read over the given text from the section ""Paper Titles"" so that we have a good understanding of the topic at hand before moving on to finding an appropriate summary template. After that we find keywords within the titles that could describe the content which then serves as input for the templates such as ""Improving RL throughcurriculum design"".

Just give me the papers titles: ------------------ Reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly popular due to recent successes in games such as Go and Chess. While many approaches exist for improving RL agents’ performance, there still remains the challenge of balancing exploration versus exploitation. To address this issue, the authors propose curriculum learning to focus the agent’s exploration towards relevant regions of state space. We present results showing how this method significantly speeds up learning on two benchmark environments and three Atari games. Results indicate that our proposed method effectively encourages targeted exploration leading to faster convergence than baseline methods. Overall, our work presents evidence that effective use of curricula leads to improved RL performance across multiple tasks. ------------------ Please provide me any additional details or specific requirements for the abstract if necessary.

"Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in both contextual bandits and reinforcement learning allows one to evaluate novel decision policies without needing to conduct exploration, which is often costly or otherwise infeasible. The problem's importance has attracted many proposed solutions, including importance sampling (IS), self-normalized IS (SNIS), and doubly robust (DR) estimates. DR and its variants ensure semiparametric local efficiency if Q-functions are well-specified, but if they are not they can be worse than both IS and SNIS. It also does not enjoy SNIS's inherent stability and boundedness. We propose new estimators for OPE based on empirical likelihood that are always more efficient than IS, SNIS, and DR and satisfy the same stability and boundedness properties as SNIS. On the way, we categorize various properties and classify existing estimators by them. Besides the theoretical guarantees, empirical studies suggest the new estimators provide advantages.",0
"This is a difficult task since you need to summarize a complex topic into one paragraph while maintaining clarity and coherence. However, here is my attempt:  In recent years, reinforcement learning has gained significant attention due to its ability to solve complex tasks without relying on explicit programming. One crucial aspect of this field involves off-policy evaluation (OPE), which assesses the expected performance of policies that differ from those used in training. Existing OPE methods either sacrifice accuracy for stability or require prohibitively large sample sizes. We present a novel approach called DualDiceQ that combines intrinsic efficiency, stability, boundedness, and high precision by leveraging data augmentation techniques. Our method improves upon current state-of-the-art algorithms, reducing error up to six times in experiments across diverse environments. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of OPE, enabling more effective use of offline datasets and stronger guarantees when deploying reinforcement learning systems in real-world scenarios.",1
"Access to parallel and distributed computation has enabled researchers and developers to improve algorithms and performance in many applications. Recent research has focused on next generation special purpose systems with multiple kinds of coprocessors, known as heterogeneous system-on-chips (SoC). In this paper, we introduce a method to intelligently schedule--and learn to schedule--a stream of tasks to available processing elements in such a system. We use deep reinforcement learning enabling complex sequential decision making and empirically show that our reinforcement learning system provides for a viable, better alternative to conventional scheduling heuristics with respect to minimizing execution time.",0
"Abstract:  A neural heterogeneous scheduler (NHS) is a software tool that utilizes machine learning techniques to intelligently manage resources across different types of computing systems such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs and more. By leveraging a deep neural network architecture, NHS can learn from historical data on system usage patterns and dynamically allocate computational resources to optimize performance while minimizing power consumption. In addition, the scheduling decisions made by the NHS can adapt to changing conditions within the computer systems, allowing for continuous optimization over time. Compared to traditional static schedulers, which rely heavily on predetermined algorithms and heuristics, NHS has been shown through experimentation to achieve significant improvements in terms of speedup, efficiency and responsiveness in diverse application domains. As modern computing continues to push towards greater parallelism and heterogeneity, the development of efficient and effective resource management tools like NHS becomes increasingly important. Thus, this work presents a comprehensive study of NHS architectures and implementation strategies aimed at providing insights into their benefits and limitations.",1
"Dealing with sparse rewards is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning. The recent use of hindsight methods have achieved success on a variety of sparse-reward tasks, but they fail on complex tasks such as stacking multiple blocks with a robot arm in simulation. Curiosity-driven exploration using the prediction error of a learned dynamics model as an intrinsic reward has been shown to be effective for exploring a number of sparse-reward environments. We present a method that combines hindsight with curiosity-driven exploration and curriculum learning in order to solve the challenging sparse-reward block stacking task. We are the first to stack more than two blocks using only sparse reward without human demonstrations.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in solving challenging real world problems across multiple domains such as robotics, computer vision, game playing, and natural language processing. However, training RL agents remains difficult due to issues like exploration, sample complexity, credit assignment, and generalization. To overcome these difficulties, researchers have introduced different techniques that aim at improving both sample efficiency and solution quality. One such technique is called Hindsight Experience Replay (HER).  HER works by generating artificial experiences using hindsight goals during offline data collection to improve the diversity and informativity of experience replay buffer samples. This method has been widely adopted in various state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms due to its effectiveness in promoting efficient policy improvement. Despite its success, applying HER only towards achieving the immediate task objective can limit the agent’s ability to learn more advanced behaviors necessary for tackling complex tasks with additional constraints or requirements. Therefore, we propose incorporating multi-criteria objectives into the goal generation process of the HER algorithm, making it curiosity-driven instead of just focused on single-objective optimization. Additionally, we show how to apply our proposed framework to achieve safe and efficient solutions in high dimension continuous control spaces where conventional wisdom suggests against directly maximizing safety criteria. Our experiments demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods, providing evidence of our claims about the importance of considering multiple factors while collecting new experiences for later use.",1
"Exploration and adaptation to new tasks in a transfer learning setup is a central challenge in reinforcement learning. In this work, we build on the idea of modeling a distribution over policies in a Bayesian deep reinforcement learning setup to propose a transfer strategy. Recent works have shown to induce diversity in the learned policies by maximizing the entropy of a distribution of policies (Bachman et al., 2018; Garnelo et al., 2018) and thus, we postulate that our proposed approach leads to faster exploration resulting in improved transfer learning. We support our hypothesis by demonstrating favorable experimental results on a variety of settings on fully-observable GridWorld and partially observable MiniGrid (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) environments.",0
"Abstract Transfer learning has become increasingly important as many machine learning models face real world constraints such as limited data sizes, computational resources, time restrictions etc. By transferring knowledge from previously learned tasks to new ones, these constrains can often be overcome or reduced which makes transfer learning attractive both theoretically and practically. In this paper we look at one specific methodology that falls under the scope of transfer learning: Policy Transfer using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). We show how the distribution over policies, used within PPO as a model free approach can be transferred from a pre-trained source policy in order to solve a task more efficiently than starting from scratch every time. This approach was evaluated on several MuJoCo environments showing consistent improvements across all scenarios compared to standard methods like Behavior Cloning, GAIL, or fine tuning existing models from previous tasks. Additionally the proposed method shows better robustness against changes in hyperparameters demonstrating the benefits gained through explicit modelling of a distribution. Our results suggest that this method could potentially benefit future research in reinforcement learning, where similar resource constraints might limit performance gains. Overall, our work highlights another aspect of transfer learning that can improve practical usability of modern RL algorithms without sacrificing theoretical soundness. Future developments shall focus on incorporating multiple sources of prior knowledge by combining multiple distributions, allowing to further boost sample efficiency gain by reducing the uncertainty related to initial exploration in novel environments.",1
"Imagine a patient in critical condition. What and when should be measured to forecast detrimental events, especially under the budget constraints? We answer this question by deep reinforcement learning (RL) that jointly minimizes the measurement cost and maximizes predictive gain, by scheduling strategically-timed measurements. We learn our policy to be dynamically dependent on the patient's health history. To scale our framework to exponentially large action space, we distribute our reward in a sequential setting that makes the learning easier. In our simulation, our policy outperforms heuristic-based scheduling with higher predictive gain and lower cost. In a real-world ICU mortality prediction task (MIMIC3), our policies reduce the total number of measurements by $31\%$ or improve predictive gain by a factor of $3$ as compared to physicians, under the off-policy policy evaluation.",0
"Dynamic measurement scheduling plays an important role in modern control systems due to their ability to improve system performance by optimizing sensors usage and reducing costs.

We evaluate our proposed method using benchmark systems under uncertainty to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving system performance through optimal sensor selection and accurate prediction. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis and insight into the behavior of our proposed model, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of the decision-making process during runtime.

"Entropy regularization is commonly used to improve policy optimization in reinforcement learning. It is believed to help with \emph{exploration} by encouraging the selection of more stochastic policies. In this work, we analyze this claim using new visualizations of the optimization landscape based on randomly perturbing the loss function. We first show that even with access to the exact gradient, policy optimization is difficult due to the geometry of the objective function. Then, we qualitatively show that in some environments, a policy with higher entropy can make the optimization landscape smoother, thereby connecting local optima and enabling the use of larger learning rates. This paper presents new tools for understanding the optimization landscape, shows that policy entropy serves as a regularizer, and highlights the challenge of designing general-purpose policy optimization algorithms.",0
"Policy gradient methods have been widely used in reinforcement learning (RL) due to their effectiveness in finding high-performance policies. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence rates, particularly in tasks that involve complex action spaces or high stochasticity. One reason for this difficulty may lie in the role of entropy regularization, which has recently gained attention as a method for stabilizing policy gradients. In particular, entropy can influence both the rate and direction of policy updates, leading to improved performance in many environments. Despite these promising results, the underlying mechanisms behind the use of entropy regularization remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to effectively apply this technique across different domains and problem settings. In this work, we aim to shed light on the behavior of entropy regularization by analyzing its interaction with two critical components of policy gradient methods: policy evaluation and update mechanics. By gaining insight into how entropy affects these processes, we hope to provide more concrete guidelines for using this regularization strategy and improve overall efficiency in RL algorithm design. Our analysis considers a range of model scenarios to demonstrate the generality of our findings and highlight conditions under which entropy regularization exerts beneficial effects versus potentially detrimental ones. Together, our study provides new insights into the relationship between policy optimization and entropy regulation, advancing researchers understanding towards improving RL algorithms through effective utilization of entropy regularization.",1
"This paper considers Safe Policy Improvement (SPI) in Batch Reinforcement Learning (Batch RL): from a fixed dataset and without direct access to the true environment, train a policy that is guaranteed to perform at least as well as the baseline policy used to collect the data. Our approach, called SPI with Baseline Bootstrapping (SPIBB), is inspired by the knows-what-it-knows paradigm: it bootstraps the trained policy with the baseline when the uncertainty is high. Our first algorithm, $\Pi_b$-SPIBB, comes with SPI theoretical guarantees. We also implement a variant, $\Pi_{\leq b}$-SPIBB, that is even more efficient in practice. We apply our algorithms to a motivational stochastic gridworld domain and further demonstrate on randomly generated MDPs the superiority of SPIBB with respect to existing algorithms, not only in safety but also in mean performance. Finally, we implement a model-free version of SPIBB and show its benefits on a navigation task with deep RL implementation called SPIBB-DQN, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first RL algorithm relying on a neural network representation able to train efficiently and reliably from batch data, without any interaction with the environment.",0

Please provide feedback and suggestions: Title: A Study On Safe Policy Improvement With Baseline Bootstrapping Abstract Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied successfully across various domains and tasks. However, training DRL agents often results in high variance and instability due to randomness from sampling actions or interactions with environments. Recent studies show that using a well designed baseline can significantly reduce the number of samples required for convergence by guiding exploration towards promising regions of the state space. This paper proposes an approach called “safe policy improvement” which combines the advantages of baseline bootstrapping and offline RL while reducing both sample complexity and risk of encountering unsafe policies. By leveraging the performance achieved by previous policies as a baseline, our method enables safe policy updates without explicit knowledge of the environment dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method through extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks including MuJoCo locomotion, Humanoid, and Acrobot, showing significant improvements over prior methods. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating previously learned behaviors into model-free RL algorithms, enabling better generalization and safer interaction with complex real-world systems. Furthermore, we discuss possible future directions for improving safety and efficiency in DRL, highlighting the importance of developing robust solutions for real-world applications.",1
"Integrating model-free and model-based approaches in reinforcement learning has the potential to achieve the high performance of model-free algorithms with low sample complexity. However, this is difficult because an imperfect dynamics model can degrade the performance of the learning algorithm, and in sufficiently complex environments, the dynamics model will almost always be imperfect. As a result, a key challenge is to combine model-based approaches with model-free learning in such a way that errors in the model do not degrade performance. We propose stochastic ensemble value expansion (STEVE), a novel model-based technique that addresses this issue. By dynamically interpolating between model rollouts of various horizon lengths for each individual example, STEVE ensures that the model is only utilized when doing so does not introduce significant errors. Our approach outperforms model-free baselines on challenging continuous control benchmarks with an order-of-magnitude increase in sample efficiency, and in contrast to previous model-based approaches, performance does not degrade in complex environments.",0
"Title: Sample Efficiency through Reinforcement Learning: An Analysis  Abstract: The goal of reinforcement learning algorithms is to maximize cumulative rewards by optimizing policies over time. However, many real-world applications require agents that can learn quickly from limited data sets, making sample efficiency crucial. This study explores the use of stochastic ensemble value expansion (SEVE) as a method for improving sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. By combining SEVE with standard methods such as Q-learning and actor-critic models, we demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency without sacrificing performance on benchmark tasks. Our results show that using SEVE leads to faster convergence, better stability, and more accurate estimates of action values. These findings have important implications for developing efficient RL agents in environments where data collection is costly or time consuming. Overall, our work highlights the potential of SEVE as a promising approach for enhancing sample efficiency in reinforcement learning.",1
"We consider the problem of imitation learning from a finite set of expert trajectories, without access to reinforcement signals. The classical approach of extracting the expert's reward function via inverse reinforcement learning, followed by reinforcement learning is indirect and may be computationally expensive. Recent generative adversarial methods based on matching the policy distribution between the expert and the agent could be unstable during training. We propose a new framework for imitation learning by estimating the support of the expert policy to compute a fixed reward function, which allows us to re-frame imitation learning within the standard reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate the efficacy of our reward function on both discrete and continuous domains, achieving comparable or better performance than the state of the art under different reinforcement learning algorithms.",0

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RED across diverse domains including robotics, computer vision, and game playing, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we present robustness analysis and ablation studies validating the importance of each component in our proposed method. Overall, RED represents a significant advance in the field of imitation learning, providing practitioners with an accessible toolkit for enhancing model performance in real-world applications.",1
"Human behavior expression and experience are inherently multi-modal, and characterized by vast individual and contextual heterogeneity. To achieve meaningful human-computer and human-robot interactions, multi-modal models of the users states (e.g., engagement) are therefore needed. Most of the existing works that try to build classifiers for the users states assume that the data to train the models are fully labeled. Nevertheless, data labeling is costly and tedious, and also prone to subjective interpretations by the human coders. This is even more pronounced when the data are multi-modal (e.g., some users are more expressive with their facial expressions, some with their voice). Thus, building models that can accurately estimate the users states during an interaction is challenging. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-modal active learning (AL) approach that uses the notion of deep reinforcement learning (RL) to find an optimal policy for active selection of the users data, needed to train the target (modality-specific) models. We investigate different strategies for multi-modal data fusion, and show that the proposed model-level fusion coupled with RL outperforms the feature-level and modality-specific models, and the naive AL strategies such as random sampling, and the standard heuristics such as uncertainty sampling. We show the benefits of this approach on the task of engagement estimation from real-world child-robot interactions during an autism therapy. Importantly, we show that the proposed multi-modal AL approach can be used to efficiently personalize the engagement classifiers to the target user using a small amount of actively selected users data.",0
"Title: A Multi-Modal Active Learning Algorithm Using Deep Reinforcement Learning  In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems across multiple domains. In particular, active learning algorithms have shown great promise in leveraging human feedback to improve model performance by actively selecting which data points to label next. However, traditional active learning methods often rely on simple heuristics that may not fully utilize all available modalities of input data.  This paper presents a novel multi-modal active learning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning. Our approach incorporates diverse types of input including image, text, audio, and even video into an active learning framework, allowing the model to learn from richer representations of each task. By explicitly optimizing both accuracy and diversity objectives in a unified deep neural network architecture, we demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in several real-world benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our method can effectively leverage expert knowledge while still respecting user preferences, leading to more efficient training and better final results.  Our contributions include introducing an end-to-end trainable deep reinforcement learning system that takes advantage of multiple modalities during active selection processes. We evaluate our framework through comprehensive experiments on publicly available datasets and showcase significant gains compared to strong baselines. This research contributes valuable insights towards creating effective, human-inspired artificial intelligence systems that excel at a wide range of tasks requiring active learning under multi-modality settings.",1
"We consider the setup of stochastic multi-armed bandits in the case when reward distributions are piecewise i.i.d. and bounded with unknown changepoints. We focus on the case when changes happen simultaneously on all arms, and in stark contrast with the existing literature, we target gap-dependent (as opposed to only gap-independent) regret bounds involving the magnitude of changes $(\Delta^{chg}_{i,g})$ and optimality-gaps ($\Delta^{opt}_{i,g}$). Diverging from previous works, we assume the more realistic scenario that there can be undetectable changepoint gaps and under a different set of assumptions, we show that as long as the compounded delayed detection for each changepoint is bounded there is no need for forced exploration to actively detect changepoints. We introduce two adaptations of UCB-strategies that employ scan-statistics in order to actively detect the changepoints, without knowing in advance the changepoints and also the mean before and after any change. Our first method \UCBLCPD does not know the number of changepoints $G$ or time horizon $T$ and achieves the first time-uniform concentration bound for this setting using the Laplace method of integration. The second strategy \ImpCPD makes use of the knowledge of $T$ to achieve the order optimal regret bound of $\min\big\lbrace O(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K} \sum\limits_{g=1}^{G}\frac{\log(T/H_{1,g})}{\Delta^{opt}_{i,g}}), O(\sqrt{GT})\big\rbrace$, (where $H_{1,g}$ is the problem complexity) thereby closing an important gap with respect to the lower bound in a specific challenging setting. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments on synthetic and real-life datasets.",0
"This paper presents new results on upper bounds for piecewise independent bandits (PIBs) under distribution dependent settings and time uniformity assumptions. By introducing novel concentration inequalities and variance decompositions tailored to PIBs, we showcase that previous works can be significantly improved upon. We develop tighter bound sequences that adapt to changes in the underlying distributions more efficiently than their counterparts. Our theoretical analysis leads to sharper regret guarantees than previously known across various parameter regimes of interest. Empirical evaluations corroborate our findings by demonstrating significant improvements over existing algorithms. These contributions expand the state of knowledge on PIBs and facilitate the design of better algorithms for sequential decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Figures, such as bar charts, pie charts, and line plots, are widely used to convey important information in a concise format. They are usually human-friendly but difficult for computers to process automatically. In this work, we investigate the problem of figure captioning where the goal is to automatically generate a natural language description of the figure. While natural image captioning has been studied extensively, figure captioning has received relatively little attention and remains a challenging problem. First, we introduce a new dataset for figure captioning, FigCAP, based on FigureQA. Second, we propose two novel attention mechanisms. To achieve accurate generation of labels in figures, we propose Label Maps Attention. To model the relations between figure labels, we propose Relation Maps Attention. Third, we use sequence-level training with reinforcement learning in order to directly optimizes evaluation metrics, which alleviates the exposure bias issue and further improves the models in generating long captions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines, thus demonstrating a significant potential for the automatic captioning of vast repositories of figures.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, we have seen significant advances in computer vision tasks like object detection and image classification. However, one task that has lagged behind is figure caption generation. This task requires understanding and summarizing images at both local and global levels, which can prove challenging even for humans. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model for generating human-like captions by leveraging reasoning capabilities along with sequence-level training techniques. Our approach includes three main components - feature extraction, context module, and sequence module - each responsible for contributing unique insights into the overall process. Using a comprehensive set of experiments on two publicly available datasets, our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of both accuracy and coherency of generated captions. Overall, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating high-order reasoning with deep learning models towards generating natural language descriptions of complex visual scenes.",1
"The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a popular platform for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. Much of the appeal comes from the fact that Atari games demonstrate aspects of competency we expect from an intelligent agent and are not biased toward any particular solution approach. The challenge of the ALE includes (1) the representation learning problem of extracting pertinent information from raw pixels, and (2) the behavioural learning problem of leveraging complex, delayed associations between actions and rewards. Often, the research questions we are interested in pertain more to the latter, but the representation learning problem adds significant computational expense. We introduce MinAtar, short for miniature Atari, a new set of environments that capture the general mechanics of specific Atari games while simplifying the representational complexity to focus more on the behavioural challenges. MinAtar consists of analogues of five Atari games: Seaquest, Breakout, Asterix, Freeway and Space Invaders. Each MinAtar environment provides the agent with a 10x10xn binary state representation. Each game plays out on a 10x10 grid with n channels corresponding to game-specific objects, such as ball, paddle and brick in the game Breakout. To investigate the behavioural challenges posed by MinAtar, we evaluated a smaller version of the DQN architecture as well as online actor-critic with eligibility traces. With the representation learning problem simplified, we can perform experiments with significantly less computational expense. In our experiments, we use the saved compute time to perform step-size parameter sweeps and more runs than is typical for the ALE. Experiments like this improve reproducibility, and allow us to draw more confident conclusions. We hope that MinAtar can allow researchers to thoroughly investigate behavioural challenges similar to those inherent in the ALE.",0
"MinAtar: An Atari-Inspired Testbed for Thorough and Reproducible Reinforcement Learning Experiments provides a comprehensive platform for conducting efficient and reliable reinforcement learning experiments using classic Atari games as test environments. This innovative tool offers numerous advantages over traditional approaches to testing reinforcement learning algorithms. By leveraging the power of distributed computing capabilities across multiple machines, MinAtar enables users to perform parallel executions and speed up experimentation. Additionally, through its integration with cloud services such as AWS Batch and Google Cloud, MinAter offers scalability that can support large-scale experimentation. Furthermore, MinAtar features built-in monitoring, logging, and analysis tools that facilitate data visualization, debugging, and reproducibility, ensuring scientific rigor and transparency in research outcomes. Overall, MinAtar represents a significant advance in the field of artificial intelligence by providing a streamlined workflow for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms and accelerating the pace of discovery.",1
"We introduce an off-policy evaluation procedure for highlighting episodes where applying a reinforcement learned (RL) policy is likely to have produced a substantially different outcome than the observed policy. In particular, we introduce a class of structural causal models (SCMs) for generating counterfactual trajectories in finite partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We see this as a useful procedure for off-policy ""debugging"" in high-risk settings (e.g., healthcare); by decomposing the expected difference in reward between the RL and observed policy into specific episodes, we can identify episodes where the counterfactual difference in reward is most dramatic. This in turn can be used to facilitate review of specific episodes by domain experts. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure with a synthetic environment of sepsis management.",0
"In many domains, evaluating the effectiveness of policies through randomized experiments can be difficult due to ethical concerns or high costs. One potential alternative approach is counterfactual off-policy evaluation (COE), which involves estimating the impact of new policies by comparing them against an existing policy using observational data. However, COE has faced several methodological challenges, including unobserved confounding factors that may bias the estimated causal effects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Gumbel-max structural causal models (GMSCM) that combines the benefits of propensity score matching and structural equation modeling. Our proposed GMSCM estimates individual treatment probabilities based on nonlinear functions of observed covariates while accounting for hidden heterogeneity and selection biases. We validate our approach using simulations and demonstrate its practical utility with two real-world case studies from education and healthcare interventions. Overall, our results indicate that GMSCM offers a promising approach for conducting robust and reliable COEs without relying on experimental settings.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for continuous action spaces are known to be brittle toward hyperparameters as well as \cut{being}sample inefficient. Soft Actor Critic (SAC) proposes an off-policy deep actor critic algorithm within the maximum entropy RL framework which offers greater stability and empirical gains. The choice of policy distribution, a factored Gaussian, is motivated by \cut{chosen due}its easy re-parametrization rather than its modeling power. We introduce Normalizing Flow policies within the SAC framework that learn more expressive classes of policies than simple factored Gaussians. \cut{We also present a series of stabilization tricks that enable effective training of these policies in the RL setting.}We show empirically on continuous grid world tasks that our approach increases stability and is better suited to difficult exploration in sparse reward settings.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results across a wide range of domains, but remains challenging due to high variance and sample complexity issues. One popular approach to address these problems is soft actor critic (SAC), which combines advantage actor-critic methods with offline policy improvement through optimization. However, despite its effectiveness, SAC still faces exploration issues that hinder efficient learning and policy quality. To mitigate these problems, we propose improving exploration in SAC by utilizing normalizing flows policies. By incorporating normalizing flow models into SAC, we aim to learn more expressive policies, enhance representation efficiency, and reduce noise during interaction. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline SAC in terms of sample efficiency, stability, and final performance on benchmark tasks such as MuJoCo locomotion and Atari games. We also conduct ablation studies to provide insights into how different design choices affect the overall performance. This work contributes to the field of deep reinforcement learning by introducing a novel technique for improving exploration in SAC using normalizing flows. Our method can serve as a foundation for future research seeking to tackle other challenges associated with RL algorithms.",1
"Many reinforcement learning (RL) tasks provide the agent with high-dimensional observations that can be simplified into low-dimensional continuous states. To formalize this process, we introduce the concept of a DeepMDP, a parameterized latent space model that is trained via the minimization of two tractable losses: prediction of rewards and prediction of the distribution over next latent states. We show that the optimization of these objectives guarantees (1) the quality of the latent space as a representation of the state space and (2) the quality of the DeepMDP as a model of the environment. We connect these results to prior work in the bisimulation literature, and explore the use of a variety of metrics. Our theoretical findings are substantiated by the experimental result that a trained DeepMDP recovers the latent structure underlying high-dimensional observations on a synthetic environment. Finally, we show that learning a DeepMDP as an auxiliary task in the Atari 2600 domain leads to large performance improvements over model-free RL.",0
"DeepMDP is a new approach that combines deep learning techniques with Markov decision processes (MDPs) to learn continuous latent space models for representation learning. This allows us to represent data in a more compact and meaningful way, making it easier to analyze and interpret. We show that our method can outperform other state-of-the-art methods on several tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model has better robustness against noise and outliers, and requires less training time than previous methods. Our results indicate that DeepMDP is a promising tool for representation learning in various domains.  Here you go!  DeepMDP is a novel framework that leverages the strengths of both deep learning and Markov decision process (MDP) theory to learn continuous latent space representations of high-dimensional datasets. By encoding complex relationships between features into interpretable latent variables, this approach enables efficient analysis and interpretation of data. In addition to achieving superior performance compared to alternative algorithms across multiple benchmark tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection, the proposed model exhibits improved resilience to outliers and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters. These findings suggest that DeepMDP could serve as a powerful solution for representation learning challenges in diverse application areas.",1
"Self-supervised learning aims to learn representations from the data itself without explicit manual supervision. Existing efforts ignore a crucial aspect of self-supervised learning - the ability to scale to large amount of data because self-supervision requires no manual labels. In this work, we revisit this principle and scale two popular self-supervised approaches to 100 million images. We show that by scaling on various axes (including data size and problem 'hardness'), one can largely match or even exceed the performance of supervised pre-training on a variety of tasks such as object detection, surface normal estimation (3D) and visual navigation using reinforcement learning. Scaling these methods also provides many interesting insights into the limitations of current self-supervised techniques and evaluations. We conclude that current self-supervised methods are not 'hard' enough to take full advantage of large scale data and do not seem to learn effective high level semantic representations. We also introduce an extensive benchmark across 9 different datasets and tasks. We believe that such a benchmark along with comparable evaluation settings is necessary to make meaningful progress. Code is at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fair_self_supervision_benchmark.",0
"An increasingly important task is visual representation learning: given lots (thousands) of images, automatically learn a compact vectorial embedding such that simple arithmetic on these vectors can capture similarity relationships between objects in the image set as well as generalize to novel testing sets. Two recent papers describe methods which achieve significant improvement over earlier state-of-the-art using ideas from self-supervision via pretext tasks. We provide new techniques to improve their performance further by scaling up the size of dataset used during training, adaptively selecting examples for efficient use of computation resources, and introducing curriculum learning to steer toward more difficult pretext tasks as training progresses. Additionally we offer two benchmarks -- a standardized collection of splits of ImageNet into smaller datasets suitable for self-supervised pretraining, along with an extensible library (INaturalist-2470K) containing millions of diverse images and tens of thousands of species labels; both suitable for evaluating transfer learning capability. We hope these tools will enable faster progress towards achieving human-level understanding of images through machine learning alone. --- Note that some of the specific details may have been updated since last I looked closely at the literature. My goal here was to concisely convey that there exists a recently discovered methodology known to work quite effectively but that has room for improvement due largely to computational resource constraints; we address those limitations and establish public research infrastructure facilitating continued rapid advances in large scale vision AI.",1
"Inspired by recent work in attention models for image captioning and question answering, we present a soft attention model for the reinforcement learning domain. This model uses a soft, top-down attention mechanism to create a bottleneck in the agent, forcing it to focus on task-relevant information by sequentially querying its view of the environment. The output of the attention mechanism allows direct observation of the information used by the agent to select its actions, enabling easier interpretation of this model than of traditional models. We analyze different strategies that the agents learn and show that a handful of strategies arise repeatedly across different games. We also show that the model learns to query separately about space and content (`where' vs. `what'). We demonstrate that an agent using this mechanism can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art models on ATARI tasks while still being interpretable.",0
"This study presents a new approach to interpreting reinforcement learning algorithms using attention augmentation. Traditionally, these algorithms have been opaque and difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand how they make decisions and which features are most important to their performance. Our proposed method uses attention mechanisms to highlight the parts of the input that are most relevant to the agent at any given time step during training and execution. By doing so, we can gain insights into which aspects of the environment are driving the agent's behavior and why certain actions are taken over others. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark tasks and show that it leads to significant improvements in both interpretability and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. These findings suggest that attention augmentation has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of complex RL models and improve decision making across various domains.",1
"Exploration strategy design is one of the challenging problems in reinforcement learning~(RL), especially when the environment contains a large state space or sparse rewards. During exploration, the agent tries to discover novel areas or high reward~(quality) areas. In most existing methods, the novelty and quality in the neighboring area of the current state are not well utilized to guide the exploration of the agent. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel RL framework, called \underline{c}lustered \underline{r}einforcement \underline{l}earning~(CRL), for efficient exploration in RL. CRL adopts clustering to divide the collected states into several clusters, based on which a bonus reward reflecting both novelty and quality in the neighboring area~(cluster) of the current state is given to the agent. Experiments on a continuous control task and several \emph{Atari 2600} games show that CRL can outperform other state-of-the-art methods to achieve the best performance in most cases.",0
"Clustered reinforcement learning (CRL) is an extension of standard reinforcement learning that uses clustering methods to group states together into clusters before learning takes place. This allows agents to learn faster by exploiting similarities within each cluster, while still allowing them to explore new behaviors across clusters as they improve their understanding of their environment. In CRL, initial exploration takes place within individual clusters, where actions chosen tend to be relatively safe, low-variance options that can quickly build up experience. Over time, agents become more confident and begin to explore riskier actions that can provide greater returns if successful. By focusing on finding efficient solutions within each cluster first, agents can reduce both the overall number of samples required and the amount of time spent making risky decisions. The primary contribution of our work lies in demonstrating the effectiveness of clustered RL algorithms in various environments from gridworlds to full-scale simulations of StarCraft II multiplayer games. Our experiments show improvements over baseline models using standard methods without clustering in terms of sample efficiency and final performance, demonstrating the potential value of incorporating ideas from CRL into future applications. Additionally, we provide analysis comparing several different approaches to state representation, including discretizing continuous action spaces and combining state features in novel ways. Our results have important implications for the development of autonomous systems capable of operating effectively in complex and uncertain environments. By providing strategies for improving sample efficiency and mitigating the risk associated with untested actions, techniques like those developed here could enable artificial intelligence to make better use of available data and adapt more rapidly to changes in environmental conditions. While there remains much work to be done in refining these methods further, our findings suggest that progress towards improved autonomous decision making may ultimately depend upon embracing uncertainty through intelligent exploratory behavior, rather than seeking simply to eliminate it altogether.",1
"Recent breakthroughs in AI for multi-agent games like Go, Poker, and Dota, have seen great strides in recent years. Yet none of these games address the real-life challenge of cooperation in the presence of unknown and uncertain teammates. This challenge is a key game mechanism in hidden role games. Here we develop the DeepRole algorithm, a multi-agent reinforcement learning agent that we test on The Resistance: Avalon, the most popular hidden role game. DeepRole combines counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) with deep value networks trained through self-play. Our algorithm integrates deductive reasoning into vector-form CFR to reason about joint beliefs and deduce partially observable actions. We augment deep value networks with constraints that yield interpretable representations of win probabilities. These innovations enable DeepRole to scale to the full Avalon game. Empirical game-theoretic methods show that DeepRole outperforms other hand-crafted and learned agents in five-player Avalon. DeepRole played with and against human players on the web in hybrid human-agent teams. We find that DeepRole outperforms human players as both a cooperator and a competitor.",0
"In many real world decision making scenarios, individuals must make decisions while interacting with others who are doing the same thing. These situations often involve multiple agents that have competing interests, leading to conflicts over resources and other issues. Multi-agent games provide a model for understanding how such interactions can lead to cooperation or conflict, depending on the goals of each agent and their relative strengths. This paper presents new theoretical results on finding friend versus foe in multi-agent systems by exploring the concept of Nash Equilibrium, which describes a state in which no player has an advantage from deviating from a strategy. We use these ideas to study simple models of games involving competition for limited resources where two players may benefit from working together against another pair. Our findings shed light on the complex dynamics of interdependent decision making in strategic environments. Ultimately, our work provides insights into the mechanisms underlying social behaviors such as altruism, coalition formation and betrayal, among others.",1
"We study the problem of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with the added twist that the learner is assisted by a helpful teacher. More formally, we tackle the following algorithmic question: How could a teacher provide an informative sequence of demonstrations to an IRL learner to speed up the learning process? We present an interactive teaching framework where a teacher adaptively chooses the next demonstration based on learner's current policy. In particular, we design teaching algorithms for two concrete settings: an omniscient setting where a teacher has full knowledge about the learner's dynamics and a blackbox setting where the teacher has minimal knowledge. Then, we study a sequential variant of the popular MCE-IRL learner and prove convergence guarantees of our teaching algorithm in the omniscient setting. Extensive experiments with a car driving simulator environment show that the learning progress can be speeded up drastically as compared to an uninformative teacher.",0
"One approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) involves training models to predict human behavior by inferring their goals from observed actions. However, current IRL algorithms often struggle with identifying plausible reward functions that accurately explain human behavior. To address this challenge, we propose interactive teaching algorithms that actively engage humans in the process of refining model predictions and enhancing the accuracy of IRL solutions. Our methods leverage human feedback during the learning process to iteratively update the predicted reward function until it aligns with the desired behavior. We demonstrate through simulations and real-world experiments that our algorithms significantly outperform baseline methods in generating accurate and interpretable models of complex tasks. Our work contributes to advancing efficient techniques for leveraging human knowledge in artificial intelligence systems, ultimately paving the way towards more effective collaboration between machines and humans.",1
"We present a method to generate directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using deep reinforcement learning, specifically deep Q-learning. Generating graphs with specified structures is an important and challenging task in various application fields, however most current graph generation methods produce graphs with undirected edges. We demonstrate that this method is capable of generating DAGs with topology and node types satisfying specified criteria in highly sparse reward environments.",0
"""Deep learning has been increasingly applied to challenging tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). However, many deep learning architectures rely on structured representations that require manual engineering or supervision. In contrast, humans naturally use graph structures like directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent complex concepts and their relationships, often without explicit guidance or training. Motivated by this observation, we develop DAGGER, a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning from human feedback that can generate high quality DAG representations directly from raw text input. Our method leverages recent advances in deep Q-learning for hierarchical reasoning, where each level corresponds to a subgraph in the overall DAG structure. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across several benchmark NLP datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of our end-to-end learned approach for generating meaningful DAG models from unstructured data. Importantly, our framework allows for flexible tradeoffs between efficiency, model capacity, interpretability, and other desiderata important for real-world applications.""",1
"Despite significant recent advances in deep neural networks, training them remains a challenge due to the highly non-convex nature of the objective function. State-of-the-art methods rely on error backpropagation, which suffers from several well-known issues, such as vanishing and exploding gradients, inability to handle non-differentiable nonlinearities and to parallelize weight-updates across layers, and biological implausibility. These limitations continue to motivate exploration of alternative training algorithms, including several recently proposed auxiliary-variable methods which break the complex nested objective function into local subproblems. However, those techniques are mainly offline (batch), which limits their applicability to extremely large datasets, as well as to online, continual or reinforcement learning. The main contribution of our work is a novel online (stochastic/mini-batch) alternating minimization (AM) approach for training deep neural networks, together with the first theoretical convergence guarantees for AM in stochastic settings and promising empirical results on a variety of architectures and datasets.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to training deep neural networks that goes beyond traditional backpropagation methods. Our method uses alternating minimization with auxiliary variables (AMVA) to optimize both the weights and biases of the network simultaneously. We show that AMVA can outperform batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent on several benchmark datasets while requiring less computational resources. Furthermore, our algorithm is able to converge faster than these other methods due to its online nature. By incorporating Lagrangian relaxation into the optimization process, we achieve better generalization performance without overfitting. In addition, our implementation allows for seamless parallelization across multiple GPUs, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. Overall, our work represents an important step towards more efficient and effective deep learning algorithms.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been proposed as a promising alternative solution to tackle the high sampling cost challenge in the canonical reinforcement learning (RL), by leveraging a learned model to generate synthesized data for policy training purpose. The MBRL framework, nevertheless, is inherently limited by the convoluted process of jointly learning control policy and configuring hyper-parameters (e.g., global/local models, real and synthesized data, etc). The training process could be tedious and prohibitively costly. In this research, we propose an ""reinforcement on reinforcement"" (RoR) architecture to decompose the convoluted tasks into two layers of reinforcement learning. The inner layer is the canonical model-based RL training process environment (TPE), which learns the control policy for the underlying system and exposes interfaces to access states, actions and rewards. The outer layer presents an RL agent, called as AI trainer, to learn an optimal hyper-parameter configuration for the inner TPE. This decomposition approach provides a desirable flexibility to implement different trainer designs, called as ""train the trainer"". In our research, we propose and optimize two alternative trainer designs: 1) a uni-head trainer and 2) a multi-head trainer. Our proposed RoR framework is evaluated for five tasks in the OpenAI gym (i.e., Pendulum, Mountain Car, Reacher, Half Cheetah and Swimmer). Compared to three other baseline algorithms, our proposed Train-the-Trainer algorithm has a competitive performance in auto-tuning capability, with upto 56% expected sampling cost saving without knowing the best parameter setting in advance. The proposed trainer framework can be easily extended to other cases in which the hyper-parameter tuning is costly.",0
"This is a research paper that proposes Intelligent Trainer (IT), which improves model-based RL by training an accurate world model as well as finding optimal policies within that learned model. We evaluate IT on challenging robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods from deep RL and model-based RL. Our approach achieves high final performance while requiring significantly fewer interactions with the real environment compared to both types of algorithms. The experimental results show that our approach is more sample efficient and able to generalize across different environments and initial states.  This paper presents Intelligent Trainer (IT) for model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In contrast to traditional model-based RL approaches that only optimize their action selection policy given a fixed world model, we propose integrating a learner into the system responsible for updating its internal representation of the task environment at hand. To this end, we introduce a novel trainer network that takes advantage of any available expert demonstrations to improve the accuracy of its predictions regarding states and transitions of the true MDP. Since these improved estimates allow us to solve optimality equations for both Q values and policy gradients online during interaction, we achieve strong zero-shot transfer performance across multiple benchmark domains and tasks. We extensively validate our approach on challenging continuous control tasks involving simulated robots, demonstrating clearly superior sample efficiency and consistency over both MBPO and DRPO baselines using comparisons including metrics such as success rate, trajectory length, and episodic return. As shown in our experiments, models trained according to the methodology proposed here reliably result in highly successful behavior even under partial observability scenarios. These findings support the idea that developing agents capable of autonomous adaptation to changing environments and problem definitions can greatly benefit from integrating prior knowledge via intelligent trainers.",1
"In this thesis, we draw inspiration from both classical system identification and modern machine learning in order to solve estimation problems for real-world, physical systems. The main approach to estimation and learning adopted is optimization based. Concepts such as regularization will be utilized for encoding of prior knowledge and basis-function expansions will be used to add nonlinear modeling power while keeping data requirements practical. The thesis covers a wide range of applications, many inspired by applications within robotics, but also extending outside this already wide field. Usage of the proposed methods and algorithms are in many cases illustrated in the real-world applications that motivated the research. Topics covered include dynamics modeling and estimation, model-based reinforcement learning, spectral estimation, friction modeling and state estimation and calibration in robotic machining. In the work on modeling and identification of dynamics, we develop regularization strategies that allow us to incorporate prior domain knowledge into flexible, overparameterized models. We make use of classical control theory to gain insight into training and regularization while using flexible tools from modern deep learning. A particular focus of the work is to allow use of modern methods in scenarios where gathering data is associated with a high cost. In the robotics-inspired parts of the thesis, we develop methods that are practically motivated and ensure that they are implementable also outside the research setting. We demonstrate this by performing experiments in realistic settings and providing open-source implementations of all proposed methods and algorithms.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for using machine learning algorithms and system identification techniques to estimate physical variables within a control loop feedback system. By utilizing principles of machine learning and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate how to design an estimator that can accurately predict key process parameters in real time. Our approach involves developing a dynamic linear model (DLM) of the physical system based on measurements obtained from sensors located throughout the plant. This DLM serves as the basis for our estimator, which combines both recursive least squares algorithm (RLS) and Kalman filtering. Experimental results show promising improvements over traditional industrial control methods, whereby our proposed technique achieves greater accuracy and robustness under noisy conditions and nonlinearities in the underlying plant processes. Our work has important implications for enhancing efficiency and performance in a variety of industries, including chemical processing, manufacturing, and automotive engineering.",1
"We present an approach to make molecular optimization more efficient. We infer a hypergraph replacement grammar from the ChEMBL database, count the frequencies of particular rules being used to expand particular nonterminals in other rules, and use these as conditional priors for the policy model. Simulating random molecules from the resulting probabilistic grammar, we show that conditional priors result in a molecular distribution closer to the training set than using equal rule probabilities or unconditional priors. We then treat molecular optimization as a reinforcement learning problem, using a novel modification of the policy gradient algorithm - batch-advantage: using individual rewards minus the batch average reward to weight the log probability loss. The reinforcement learning agent is tasked with building molecules using this grammar, with the goal of maximizing benchmark scores available from the literature. To do so, the agent has policies both to choose the next node in the graph to expand and to select the next grammar rule to apply. The policies are implemented using the Transformer architecture with the partially expanded graph as the input at each step. We show that using the empirical priors as the starting point for a policy eliminates the need for pre-training, and allows us to reach optima faster. We achieve competitive performance on common benchmarks from the literature, such as penalized logP and QED, with only hundreds of training steps on a budget GPU instance.",0
"Optimization of molecules underlies many technological applications such as pharmaceutical design and renewable energy materials discovery. Computational methods that can efficiently search large chemical spaces and predict properties relevant to specific application targets could accelerate these searches by orders of magnitude.

"We present RL-VAE, a graph-to-graph variational autoencoder that uses reinforcement learning to decode molecular graphs from latent embeddings. Methods have been described previously for graph-to-graph autoencoding, but these approaches require sophisticated decoders that increase the complexity of training and evaluation (such as requiring parallel encoders and decoders or non-trivial graph matching). Here, we repurpose a simple graph generator to enable efficient decoding and generation of molecular graphs.",0

With recent advances in machine learning, it has become possible to encode complex chemical structures as continuous vectors, known as molecular graph embeddings. However, there remains a challenge in decoding these embeddings into meaningful outputs, such as physicochemical properties, bioactivity predictions, and functional group analysis. In this work, we propose using deep reinforcement learning algorithms to decode molecular graph embeddings, allowing us to generate accurate predictions without relying on explicit physical models. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across several benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement in both accuracy and interpretability. Overall, this research paves the way for more advanced applications of molecular graph embeddings in drug discovery and other fields within chemistry and biology.",1
We propose reinforcement learning on simple networks consisting of random connections of spiking neurons (both recurrent and feed-forward) that can learn complex tasks with very little trainable parameters. Such sparse and randomly interconnected recurrent spiking networks exhibit highly non-linear dynamics that transform the inputs into rich high-dimensional representations based on past context. The random input representations can be efficiently interpreted by an output (or readout) layer with trainable parameters. Systematic initialization of the random connections and training of the readout layer using Q-learning algorithm enable such small random spiking networks to learn optimally and achieve the same learning efficiency as humans on complex reinforcement learning tasks like Atari games. The spike-based approach using small random recurrent networks provides a computationally efficient alternative to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning networks with several layers of trainable parameters. The low-complexity spiking networks can lead to improved energy efficiency in event-driven neuromorphic hardware for complex reinforcement learning tasks.,0
"Title: ""Reinforcement Learning with Low-Compleplexity Liquid State Machines"" Authors: [Insert names here] Abstract Low-complexity liquid state machines (LLSMs) have recently emerged as powerful models for real-time optimization tasks due to their ability to quickly adapt to changes in input streams while maintaining computational efficiency. In this work, we explore the use of LLSMs for reinforcement learning applications by training them on simulated robotics tasks using deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our approach results in significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of both accuracy and speed, enabling agents equipped with LLSMs to learn more efficiently under complex task constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate how LLSMs can effectively handle delayed rewards by incorporating eligibility traces into the system to prevent forgetting older experiences. Our findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLSMs in RL settings and lay the groundwork for future research exploring the potential of these systems in real-world applications.

"Polynomial inequalities lie at the heart of many mathematical disciplines. In this paper, we consider the fundamental computational task of automatically searching for proofs of polynomial inequalities. We adopt the framework of semi-algebraic proof systems that manipulate polynomial inequalities via elementary inference rules that infer new inequalities from the premises. These proof systems are known to be very powerful, but searching for proofs remains a major difficulty. In this work, we introduce a machine learning based method to search for a dynamic proof within these proof systems. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns an embedding of the polynomials and guides the choice of inference rules, taking the inherent symmetries of the problem as an inductive bias. We compare our approach with powerful and widely-studied linear programming hierarchies based on static proof systems, and show that our method reduces the size of the linear program by several orders of magnitude while also improving performance. These results hence pave the way towards augmenting powerful and well-studied semi-algebraic proof systems with machine learning guiding strategies for enhancing the expressivity of such proof systems.",0
"This is an abstract I was given but need it rewritten: ""This paper examines how to create static models for proving mathematical facts expressed as polynomial equations."" A key challenge in automating proof assistants such as Isabelle/HOL and Coq lies in creating suitable axiomatic foundations that can express both classical mathematics and new methods from computer science (such as homotopy type theory). In turn, the development of appropriate foundations depends crucially on obtaining a good understanding of fundamental concepts like polynomial identity testing. We argue that recent advances in learning theory offer promising routes towards such improved foundations by providing rigorous probabilistic guarantees for the first time. Specifically, we show how techniques based on sum-of-squares certificates yield efficient algorithms for verifying polynomial identities whose correctness is guaranteed up to any desired precision. Our results provide concrete evidence that computational problems rooted in algebraic geometry admit fully automatic solutions; they may thus lead to further breakthroughs in related areas beyond proof theory itself. To achieve these goals, our work builds upon deep connections linking formal verification, cryptography, and representation theory. The present contribution constitutes a step into a larger program aimed at designing logics capable of encoding substantial parts of mainstream math while remaining computationally manageable.",1
"The posterior variance of Gaussian processes is a valuable measure of the learning error which is exploited in various applications such as safe reinforcement learning and control design. However, suitable analysis of the posterior variance which captures its behavior for finite and infinite number of training data is missing. This paper derives a novel bound for the posterior variance function which requires only local information because it depends only on the number of training samples in the proximity of a considered test point. Furthermore, we prove sufficient conditions which ensure the convergence of the posterior variance to zero. Finally, we demonstrate that the extension of our bound to an average learning bound outperforms existing approaches.",0
"This paper presents a new method for performing posterior variance analysis on Gaussian processes with application to average learning curves. We develop two methods based on different assumptions about prior knowledge of the data generating process: one that assumes no prior information, and another that utilizes prior information to improve inference accuracy. Our methods allow researchers to quantify uncertainty in their results, which can then be used to make informed decisions and guide future study design. In addition, we provide examples demonstrating the utility of our approach in practice, including applications in psychology and neuroscience. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool for scientists seeking to gain insights into complex systems through machine learning approaches such as Gaussian processes.",1
"Autonomous multiple tasks learning is a fundamental capability to develop versatile artificial agents that can act in complex environments. In real-world scenarios, tasks may be interrelated (or ""hierarchical"") so that a robot has to first learn to achieve some of them to set the preconditions for learning other ones. Even though different strategies have been used in robotics to tackle the acquisition of interrelated tasks, in particular within the developmental robotics framework, autonomous learning in this kind of scenarios is still an open question. Building on previous research in the framework of intrinsically motivated open-ended learning, in this work we describe how this question can be addressed working on the level of task selection, in particular considering the multiple interrelated tasks scenario as an MDP where the system is trying to maximise its competence over all the tasks.",0

"Many recent successful (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms make use of regularization, generally based on entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence. We propose a general theory of regularized Markov Decision Processes that generalizes these approaches in two directions: we consider a larger class of regularizers, and we consider the general modified policy iteration approach, encompassing both policy iteration and value iteration. The core building blocks of this theory are a notion of regularized Bellman operator and the Legendre-Fenchel transform, a classical tool of convex optimization. This approach allows for error propagation analyses of general algorithmic schemes of which (possibly variants of) classical algorithms such as Trust Region Policy Optimization, Soft Q-learning, Stochastic Actor Critic or Dynamic Policy Programming are special cases. This also draws connections to proximal convex optimization, especially to Mirror Descent.",0
"The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides over the past few decades thanks in part to advancements in reinforcement learning. One area that has received particular attention is that of Markov decision processes (MDPs), which model decision making under uncertainty by representing states, actions, rewards, and transitions as probabilities. These models have been successfully used in applications ranging from robotics to finance.  However, MDPs suffer from several limitations, including their reliance on perfect state knowledge and the assumption of stationarity. In practice, these assumptions often fail to hold true, leading to suboptimal policies and poor performance. To address these shortcomings, regularization techniques have been proposed to constrain the behavior policy such that it exhibits desirable properties like risk-aversion or exploration.  This paper presents a theory of regularized MDPs (RMDPs) aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice. We first review existing work on regularizing RL algorithms, focusing on how they modify value functions, policies, and the optimization problem itself. Then we present a novel framework that unifies existing approaches and generalizes them to more complex settings. Our approach allows us to provide new insights into the effects of different forms of regularization on solution quality and computational efficiency.  We empirically evaluate our approach on a set of well-known benchmark problems and show that regularization leads to substantial improvements across a range of environments and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our theoretical results translate into practically relevant recommendations for selecting appropriate hyperparameters for regularization.  Overall, this paper represents an important step towards building reliable and efficient AI systems that can operate effectively in real-world scenarios. By providing a rigorous foundation for understanding how regularization affects RL solutions, we hope to facilitate further progress in developing robust methodologies for solving complex MDP tasks.",1
"Truckload brokerages, a $100 billion/year industry in the U.S., plays the critical role of matching shippers with carriers, often to move loads several days into the future. Brokerages not only have to find companies that will agree to move a load, the brokerage often has to find a price that both the shipper and carrier will agree to. The price not only varies by shipper and carrier, but also by the traffic lanes and other variables such as commodity type. Brokerages have to learn about shipper and carrier response functions by offering a price and observing whether each accepts the quote. We propose a knowledge gradient policy with bootstrap aggregation for high-dimensional contextual settings to guide price experimentation by maximizing the value of information. The learning policy is tested using a carefully calibrated fleet simulator that includes a stochastic lookahead policy that simulates fleet movements, as well as the stochastic modeling of driver assignments and the carrier's load commitment policies with advance booking.",0

Our results show that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods by offering higher returns with greater efficiency and more stable pricing mechanisms.",1
"While multi-agent interactions can be naturally modeled as a graph, the environment has traditionally been considered as a black box. We propose to create a shared agent-entity graph, where agents and environmental entities form vertices, and edges exist between the vertices which can communicate with each other.

Our proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is invariant to the number of agents or entities present in the system as well as permutation invariance, both of which are desirable properties for any multi-agent system representation. We present state-of-the-art results on coverage, formation and line control tasks for multi-agent teams in a fully decentralized framework and further show that the learned policies quickly transfer to scenarios with different team sizes along with strong zero-shot generalization performance.

"Despite significant progress, deep reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from data-inefficiency and limited generalization. Recent efforts apply meta-learning to learn a meta-learner from a set of RL tasks such that a novel but related task could be solved quickly. Though specific in some ways, different tasks in meta-RL are generally similar at a high level. However, most meta-RL methods do not explicitly and adequately model the specific and shared information among different tasks, which limits their ability to learn training tasks and to generalize to novel tasks. In this paper, we propose to capture the shared information on the one hand and meta-learn how to quickly abstract the specific information about a task on the other hand. Methodologically, we train an SGD meta-learner to quickly optimize a task encoder for each task, which generates a task embedding based on past experience. Meanwhile, we learn a policy which is shared across all tasks and conditioned on task embeddings. Empirical results on four simulated tasks demonstrate that our method has better learning capacity on both training and novel tasks and attains up to 3 to 4 times higher returns compared to baselines.",0
"In this paper we present a meta reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes task embedding techniques and shared policies to improve sample efficiency and generalization performance across multiple tasks.

Furthermore, by using learned knowledge from previous tasks to inform future ones through shared policies, our method significantly reduces the number of interactions required to achieve acceptable levels of performance on unseen tasks. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential advantages of incorporating meta learning mechanisms into RL algorithms to enhance their ability to quickly adapt to novel situations. -----  Title: Meta Reinforcement Learning with Task Embedding and Shared Policies.  Abstract: This paper introduces a meta reinforcement learning algorithm designed to increase sample efficiency and generalize across multiple tasks. By employing task embedding techniques and shared policies, our approach enables agents to rapidly learn from previous experience and adapt to new challenges without significant additional training data. Specifically, our method maps individual tasks onto points within a low-dimensional continuous task representation space, allowing learned knowledge to transfer seamlessly between similar problems. Evaluations reveal improved OPE accuracy and higher overall agent performance following fine-tuning on unseen tasks, resulting in significantly reduced interaction requirements during adaptation. These findings support the effectiveness of integrating meta learning principles into traditional RL methods, with potentially wide-ranging applications in dynamic environments with evolving objectives. Further investigation may expand upon the broader implications of this work, opening up exciting possibilities for advanced artificial intelligence systems that can effectively operate in complex real-world settings.",1
"One problem in the application of reinforcement learning to real-world problems is the curse of dimensionality on the action space. Macro actions, a sequence of primitive actions, have been studied to diminish the dimensionality of the action space with regard to the time axis. However, previous studies relied on humans defining macro actions or assumed macro actions as repetitions of the same primitive actions. We present Factorized Macro Action Reinforcement Learning (FaMARL) which autonomously learns disentangled factor representation of a sequence of actions to generate macro actions that can be directly applied to general reinforcement learning algorithms. FaMARL exhibits higher scores than other reinforcement learning algorithms on environments that require an extensive amount of search.",0

The applications of this watermarking scheme include detection of unauthorized replications of proprietary policies, as well as enabling the graceful interruption or termination of DRL activities by authorized entities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal via experimental evaluation of watermarking a DQN policy trained in the Cartpole environment.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to solving complex decision-making problems. However, DRL policies have limited interpretability and accountability due to their inherent complexity. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to ensure that these models make ethical decisions, particularly in critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, or financial trading systems. To address these concerns, we propose sequential triggers for watermarking of DRL policies. Our approach leverages existing backdoors or adversarial examples and can significantly improve the interpretability and traceability of DRL models without noticeably compromising performance. We demonstrate our method on two popular benchmarks, CartPole and MountainCar, using both supervised learning and reinforcement learning settings. Our results show that sequential triggers effectively embed robust fingerprints into the learned policy while preserving task accuracy and stability under variations in hyperparameters and environmental conditions. Overall, our work offers a simple yet effective solution for enhancing accountability and explainability in DRL models through the use of lightweight and flexible watermarks.

"In this paper, the problem of describing visual contents of a video sequence with natural language is addressed. Unlike previous video captioning work mainly exploiting the cues of video contents to make a language description, we propose a reconstruction network (RecNet) in a novel encoder-decoder-reconstructor architecture, which leverages both forward (video to sentence) and backward (sentence to video) flows for video captioning. Specifically, the encoder-decoder component makes use of the forward flow to produce a sentence description based on the encoded video semantic features. Two types of reconstructors are subsequently proposed to employ the backward flow and reproduce the video features from local and global perspectives, respectively, capitalizing on the hidden state sequence generated by the decoder. Moreover, in order to make a comprehensive reconstruction of the video features, we propose to fuse the two types of reconstructors together. The generation loss yielded by the encoder-decoder component and the reconstruction loss introduced by the reconstructor are jointly cast into training the proposed RecNet in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, the RecNet is fine-tuned by CIDEr optimization via reinforcement learning, which significantly boosts the captioning performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed reconstructor can boost the performance of video captioning consistently.",0
"Automatically generating textual descriptions of videos has been a challenging task due to the diversity of visual contents and the variability of human preferences on how to describe them. Existing methods mostly rely on pre-defined rules or heuristics without fully considering their effectiveness on different scenarios. In this work, we propose a new framework based on reinforcement learning that directly optimizes the caption quality by maximizing user satisfaction on selected keywords. We first pretrain a deep neural network model to reconstruct the most probable input video from a natural language description using reconstruction loss as reward signal. Then we fine-tune our model towards real-time video captioning tasks where a policy agent takes actions selecting keywords from a dictionary to generate desired sentences given partial contexts provided by users. At each step, a discriminator evaluates the coherency between generated sentence and ground truth caption, providing guidance signals to update both agent parameters and keyword selection probabilities. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements achieved by our method over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, qualitative analysis validates the interpretability of learned representations in capturing meaningful video content features. Our approach sheds light on the potential application of deep reinforcement learning into media processing domains beyond just image generation tasks.",1
"While off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods have widely been used in reinforcement learning due to their efficiency and simple implementation, their Bayesian counterparts have not been utilized as frequently. One reason is that the non-linear max operation in the Bellman optimality equation makes it difficult to define conjugate distributions over the value functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach to off-policy TD methods, called as ADFQ, which updates beliefs on state-action values, Q, through an online Bayesian inference method known as Assumed Density Filtering. We formulate an efficient closed-form solution for the value update by approximately estimating analytic parameters of the posterior of the Q-beliefs. Uncertainty measures in the beliefs not only are used in exploration but also provide a natural regularization for the value update considering all next available actions. ADFQ converges to Q-learning as the uncertainty measures of the Q-beliefs decrease and improves common drawbacks of other Bayesian RL algorithms such as computational complexity. We extend ADFQ with a neural network. Our empirical results demonstrate that ADFQ outperforms comparable algorithms on various Atari 2600 games, with drastic improvements in highly stochastic domains or domains with a large action space.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to reinforcement learning called assumed density filtering (ADF) Q-learning.

We evaluate ADF Q-learning on a range of challenging tasks and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods across the board. Our results show that ADF Q-learning is capable of achieving human-level performance on tasks that previously required hand-engineered solutions or were considered difficult for machine learning approaches. Overall, ADF Q-learning represents a significant advancement in the field of reinforcement learning and has the potential to enable breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.",1
"Recent results in Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown that agents with limited training environments are susceptible to a large amount of overfitting across many domains.

The paper further analyzes the proposed formulation of inverse reinforcement learning with $n$ states and $k$ actions, and shows a sample complexity of $O(n^2 \log (nk))$ for recovering a reward function that generates a policy that satisfies Bellman's optimality condition with respect to the true transition probabilities.",0
"This paper examines the problem of inverse reinforcement learning (RL).

We provide bounds on the sample complexity of these algorithms using results from RL theory as well as techniques like stability balls and covering numbers. Our findings show that both BGA and RCA have polynomial sample complexities under mild assumptions. Finally, we consider special cases such as linear policies where the sample complexities can improve significantly. Overall, our work provides insight into how efficiently we can learn unknown policies through inverse RL methods, and suggests promising directions for future research.",1
"Several recent papers have examined generalization in reinforcement learning (RL), by proposing new environments or ways to add noise to existing environments, then benchmarking algorithms and model architectures on those environments. We discuss subtle conceptual properties of RL benchmarks that are not required in supervised learning (SL), and also properties that an RL benchmark should possess. Chief among them is one we call the principle of unchanged optimality: there should exist a single $\pi$ that is optimal across all train and test tasks. In this work, we argue why this principle is important, and ways it can be broken or satisfied due to subtle choices in state representation or model architecture. We conclude by discussing challenges and future lines of research in theoretically analyzing generalization benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding generalization in reinforcement learning (RL). This refers to the ability of RL algorithms to transfer knowledge learned from one task or environment to another that shares similar characteristics. One principle that has gained increasing attention in the field is unchanged optimality.  The principle of unchanged optimality posits that the optimal behavior of an agent remains constant across different environments, as long as the underlying principles guiding decision making stay consistent. This means that an agent should exhibit optimal behavior regardless of whether it encounters new states or transitions that were never encountered during training.  This idea has been explored through the study of model-free RL methods such as Q-learning and SARSA. These methods learn an approximate value function that estimates expected future reward by accumulating advantage estimates based on changes in state visitation frequencies over time. By showing how these algorithms adhere to unchanged optimality under specific conditions, researchers have demonstrated that this principle can provide important insights into understanding how agents make decisions and reason about their environment.  Despite these advances, there remain many open questions surrounding the scope and limitations of the unchanged optimality principle. For example, little is known about how this idea relates to other forms of RL, including model-based methods and those using deep neural networks. Furthermore, while the principle can offer valuable theoretical insights, it still needs to be tested and evaluated in real-world applications where performance matters most.  In conclusion, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on generalization in RL by investigating the role of the unchanged optimality principle in shaping agent behavior. We aim to build upon existing research in this area and extend its applicability beyond traditional model-free RL methods. Our findings will shed light on the broader implications o",1
"In this paper, we propose Rogue-Gym, a simple and classic style roguelike game built for evaluating generalization in reinforcement learning (RL). Combined with the recent progress of deep neural networks, RL has successfully trained human-level agents without human knowledge in many games such as those for Atari 2600. However, it has been pointed out that agents trained with RL methods often overfit the training environment, and they work poorly in slightly different environments. To investigate this problem, some research environments with procedural content generation have been proposed. Following these studies, we propose the use of roguelikes as a benchmark for evaluating the generalization ability of RL agents. In our Rogue-Gym, agents need to explore dungeons that are structured differently each time they start a new game. Thanks to the very diverse structures of the dungeons, we believe that the generalization benchmark of Rogue-Gym is sufficiently fair. In our experiments, we evaluate a standard reinforcement learning method, PPO, with and without enhancements for generalization. The results show that some enhancements believed to be effective fail to mitigate the overfitting in Rogue-Gym, although others slightly improve the generalization ability.",0

"We study how to set channel numbers in a neural network to achieve better accuracy under constrained resources (e.g., FLOPs, latency, memory footprint or model size). A simple and one-shot solution, named AutoSlim, is presented. Instead of training many network samples and searching with reinforcement learning, we train a single slimmable network to approximate the network accuracy of different channel configurations. We then iteratively evaluate the trained slimmable model and greedily slim the layer with minimal accuracy drop. By this single pass, we can obtain the optimized channel configurations under different resource constraints. We present experiments with MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2, ResNet-50 and RL-searched MNasNet on ImageNet classification. We show significant improvements over their default channel configurations.

We show through extensive experiments that our approach consistently finds architectures that perform well on a diverse set of benchmarks while significantly reducing computational cost compared to previous works. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using RL for automatically selecting channel numbers during the search process and provide evidence that our method can serve as a strong baseline for future research in this area.",1
"Standard reinforcement learning methods aim to master one way of solving a task whereas there may exist multiple near-optimal policies. Being able to identify this collection of near-optimal policies can allow a domain expert to efficiently explore the space of reasonable solutions. Unfortunately, existing approaches that quantify uncertainty over policies are not ultimately relevant to finding policies with qualitatively distinct behaviors. In this work, we formalize the difference between policies as a difference between the distribution of trajectories induced by each policy, which encourages diversity with respect to both state visitation and action choices. We derive a gradient-based optimization technique that can be combined with existing policy gradient methods to now identify diverse collections of well-performing policies.

Unlike previous methods which only optimize for one policy at a time, our approach optimizes for a set of policies while promoting their diversity as well. We use maximum mean discrepancy as a measure of distance between two probability distributions to encourage the learned policies to have different behaviors. Our method outperforms existing algorithms on several benchmark tasks, including reaching, pushing, and biped walking. Additionally, we show that DIPG produces more interpretable results by visualizing the behavior of each learned policy in action space.",1
"Experience reuse is key to sample-efficient reinforcement learning. One of the critical issues is how the experience is represented and stored. Previously, the experience can be stored in the forms of features, individual models, and the average model, each lying at a different granularity. However, new tasks may require experience across multiple granularities. In this paper, we propose the policy residual representation (PRR) network, which can extract and store multiple levels of experience. PRR network is trained on a set of tasks with a multi-level architecture, where a module in each level corresponds to a subset of the tasks. Therefore, the PRR network represents the experience in a spectrum-like way. When training on a new task, PRR can provide different levels of experience for accelerating the learning. We experiment with the PRR network on a set of grid world navigation tasks, locomotion tasks, and fighting tasks in a video game. The results show that the PRR network leads to better reuse of experience and thus outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex decision making problems in fields such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing. However, one major challenge facing RL algorithms is their slow convergence rate and sample efficiency. This means that they often require a large number of interactions with their environment before they can learn effective policies.  In this paper, we propose a novel method called policy residual representation (PRR), which enables efficient reuse of experience in RL. PRR represents an agent's learned knowledge as a residual function over a pretrained set of policies. By storing these representations and reusing them to initialize new agents, PRR significantly reduces the time required to converge on a given task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a range of benchmark domains and compare it against other state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that PRR achieves superior performance while requiring fewer interactions with the environment. Overall, our work provides insights into how machine learning models can leverage past experiences effectively and efficiently, paving the way for improved generalization and transferability across tasks.",1
"Effective medical test suggestions benefit both patients and physicians to conserve time and improve diagnosis accuracy. In this work, we show that an agent can learn to suggest effective medical tests. We formulate the problem as a stage-wise Markov decision process and propose a reinforcement learning method to train the agent. We introduce a new representation of multiple action policy along with the training method of the proposed representation. Furthermore, a new exploration scheme is proposed to accelerate the learning of disease distributions. Our experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of disease diagnosis can be significantly improved with good medical test suggestions.",0
"This research uses deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to develop an effective approach for medical test suggestions. We aimed to suggest diagnostic tests that would improve clinical outcomes while minimizing risks and costs associated with excessive testing. Our RL model was trained on historical patient data and guidelines from expert physicians. Results showed that our method effectively suggested appropriate tests, achieving higher accuracy compared to existing methods. The potential benefits of this technology could greatly impact healthcare practice by improving diagnosis efficiency and reducing unnecessary medical expenses.",1
"Most practical recommender systems focus on estimating immediate user engagement without considering the long-term effects of recommendations on user behavior. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods offer the potential to optimize recommendations for long-term user engagement. However, since users are often presented with slates of multiple items - which may have interacting effects on user choice - methods are required to deal with the combinatorics of the RL action space. In this work, we address the challenge of making slate-based recommendations to optimize long-term value using RL. Our contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop SLATEQ, a decomposition of value-based temporal-difference and Q-learning that renders RL tractable with slates. Under mild assumptions on user choice behavior, we show that the long-term value (LTV) of a slate can be decomposed into a tractable function of its component item-wise LTVs. (ii) We outline a methodology that leverages existing myopic learning-based recommenders to quickly develop a recommender that handles LTV. (iii) We demonstrate our methods in simulation, and validate the scalability of decomposed TD-learning using SLATEQ in live experiments on YouTube.",0
"In this work, we introduce a novel approach for using reinforcement learning (RL) in slate-based recommender systems. We develop a tractable decomposition method that allows us to decompose the complex problem into simpler subproblems, which can then be solved more efficiently. Our method involves breaking down the original problem into smaller subproblems by iteratively decomposing each user recommendation slot until only singly relevant items remain. This allows us to learn separate policies for each item in the slate and improve overall performance.  We propose a new model architecture called ""SlateDQN"" that uses deep Q-learning to optimize the reward functions defined on the recommended items. The architecture consists of multiple layers of DNNs, where each layer predicts the probability distribution over all possible actions given the current state representation. To address the challenge of sparse rewards in RL, we use a hybrid mechanism based on both intrinsic motivation and external shaping signals from human feedback.  Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to existing baseline methods. We conducted experiments on real datasets across different domains such as movies, news articles, and jobs, and showed consistent improvements in terms of both accuracy metrics and click-through rates. Moreover, our method scales well even for large problems involving millions of users and items. Overall, our framework provides a powerful toolkit for designing efficient and effective RL-based recommenders in practice.",1
"Many potential applications of reinforcement learning in the real world involve interacting with other agents whose numbers vary over time. We propose new neural policy architectures for these multi-agent problems. In contrast to other methods of training an individual, discrete policy for each agent and then enforcing cooperation through some additional inter-policy mechanism, we follow the spirit of recent work on the power of relational inductive biases in deep networks by learning multi-agent relationships at the policy level via an attentional architecture. In our method, all agents share the same policy, but independently apply it in their own context to aggregate the other agents' state information when selecting their next action. The structure of our architectures allow them to be applied on environments with varying numbers of agents. We demonstrate our architecture on a benchmark multi-agent autonomous vehicle coordination problem, obtaining superior results to a full-knowledge, fully-centralized reference solution, and significantly outperforming it when scaling to large numbers of agents.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in developing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms that can learn effective policies across multiple environments or tasks. One key challenge facing these algorithms is how to allocate attention (e.g., via exploration) among different contexts or goals. We address this challenge by proposing a novel framework called cross-context attentional policy gradient (CCAPG), which extends traditional actor-critic methods with a shared critic network trained jointly across all contexts using a unified objective function. This allows our approach to automatically balance exploitation vs. exploration within each context while adaptively allocating attention based on current estimates of return in both single and multitask settings. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CCAPG compared to prior state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, performance, and robustness to hyperparameter choices, making it well suited for real-world applications where flexible allocation of computational resources is necessary. Keywords: reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, attention allocation, transfer learning, policy gradients",1
"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning algorithms have shown great potential and success for solving many challenging real-world problems, including Go game and robotic applications. Usually, these algorithms need a carefully designed reward function to guide training in each time step. However, in real world, it is non-trivial to design such a reward function, and the only signal available is usually obtained at the end of a trajectory, also known as the episodic reward or return. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for temporal credit assignment, which learns to decompose the episodic return back to each time-step in the trajectory using deep neural networks. With this learned reward signal, the learning efficiency can be substantially improved for episodic reinforcement learning. In particular, we find that expressive language models such as the Transformer can be adopted for learning the importance and the dependency of states in the trajectory, therefore providing high-quality and interpretable learned reward signals. We have performed extensive experiments on a set of MuJoCo continuous locomotive control tasks with only episodic returns and demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithm.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), credit assignment refers to the problem of allocating credit among different elements within a system that contribute to overall success or failure. This allocation becomes particularly challenging in episodic RL tasks where actions can lead to delayed rewards spread out over multiple steps. Existing methods have proposed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as part of actor-critic architectures to model temporal dependencies in credit assignments. However, these models often suffer from compounding errors due to their recursive nature. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach based on sequence modeling techniques inspired by transformers. Our method, called Transformer-based Episodic Recursive Agent (TERA), directly predicts future reward contributions conditioned on both past observations and rewards, without explicitly storing hidden states like RNNs. We evaluate TERA on several benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art RNN baselines across diverse domains. Overall, our work represents a step forward in advancing the ability of agents to reason about delayed consequences and make more accurate decisions in complex environments.",1
"Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown strong performance in complex domains such as Atari games, but are often highly sample inefficient. A common approach to reduce interaction time with the environment is to use reward shaping, which involves carefully designing reward functions that provide the agent intermediate rewards for progress towards the goal. However, designing appropriate shaping rewards is known to be difficult as well as time-consuming. In this work, we address this problem by using natural language instructions to perform reward shaping. We propose the LanguagE-Action Reward Network (LEARN), a framework that maps free-form natural language instructions to intermediate rewards based on actions taken by the agent. These intermediate language-based rewards can seamlessly be integrated into any standard reinforcement learning algorithm. We experiment with Montezuma's Revenge from the Atari Learning Environment, a popular benchmark in RL. Our experiments on a diverse set of 15 tasks demonstrate that, for the same number of interactions with the environment, language-based rewards lead to successful completion of the task 60% more often on average, compared to learning without language.",0
"Artificial intelligence agents typically rely on large amounts of human engineering effort to scale to realistically complex tasks. We propose to leverage natural language instructions from humans to guide reward shaping in reinforcement learning. By modeling reward functions as black boxes, we can use feedback from human users to adjust rewards until they align better with their objectives. Experiments across three domains demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods by using less than one percent of human data and requiring minimal domain knowledge. Our results suggest that natural language guidance holds promise for scaling up modern AI systems while reducing reliance on manual tuning.",1
"The goal of computational color constancy is to preserve the perceptive colors of objects under different lighting conditions by removing the effect of color casts caused by the scene's illumination. With the rapid development of deep learning based techniques, significant progress has been made in image semantic segmentation. In this work, we exploit the semantic information together with the color and spatial information of the input image in order to remove color casts. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that learns to estimate the illuminant color and gamma correction parameters based on the semantic information of the given image. Experimental results show that feeding the CNN with the semantic information leads to a significant improvement in the results by reducing the error by more than 40%.",0
"In image processing, white balance refers to adjusting the colors in an image so that it appears as if lit by pure white light. This helps ensure accurate color representation across different conditions like natural light, tungsten bulbs, fluorescent lamps, etc. However, achieving perfect color constancy remains challenging due to complex illumination scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose ""Semantic White Balance"" - a new technique based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach uses semantic scene understanding to identify dominant regions in images and adaptively adjusts these regions' color casts without affecting other parts of the picture. For instance, if a photo contains a person sitting indoors under incandescent lights next to a window facing bright sunlight, our method would neutralize the yellowish hue caused by the indoor lighting while preserving the blue sky visible through the window. We evaluate Semantic White Balance using common benchmark datasets, such as MIT-Adobe FiveK and Cube+2017. Our results demonstrate significantly improved performance compared to existing methods, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we showcase applications of our approach in real-world use cases, including smartphone cameras and augmented reality systems. Overall, our work represents a significant contribution towards solving the problem of semantic color constancy under complex lighting conditions, paving the way for more advanced computer vision tasks relying on accurate color reproduction.

"Model-based reinforcement learning is an appealing framework for creating agents that learn, plan, and act in sequential environments. Model-based algorithms typically involve learning a transition model that takes a state and an action and outputs the next state---a one-step model. This model can be composed with itself to enable predicting multiple steps into the future, but one-step prediction errors can get magnified, leading to unacceptable inaccuracy. This compounding-error problem plagues planning and undermines model-based reinforcement learning. In this paper, we address the compounding-error problem by introducing a multi-step model that directly outputs the outcome of executing a sequence of actions. Novel theoretical and empirical results indicate that the multi-step model is more conducive to efficient value-function estimation, and it yields better action selection compared to the one-step model. These results make a strong case for using multi-step models in the context of model-based reinforcement learning.",0

Additionally, our method enables the use of less data which could greatly benefit domains where large amounts of labeled training data aren’t available.

"AI agents are being developed to support high stakes decision-making processes from driving cars to prescribing drugs, making it increasingly important for human users to understand their behavior. Policy summarization methods aim to convey strengths and weaknesses of such agents by demonstrating their behavior in a subset of informative states. Some policy summarization methods extract a summary that optimizes the ability to reconstruct the agent's policy under the assumption that users will deploy inverse reinforcement learning. In this paper, we explore the use of different models for extracting summaries. We introduce an imitation learning-based approach to policy summarization; we demonstrate through computational simulations that a mismatch between the model used to extract a summary and the model used to reconstruct the policy results in worse reconstruction quality; and we demonstrate through a human-subject study that people use different models to reconstruct policies in different contexts, and that matching the summary extraction model to these can improve performance. Together, our results suggest that it is important to carefully consider user models in policy summarization.",0
"""Exploring Computational User Models for Agent Policy Summarization"" presents methods that use machine learning algorithms to generate user models in interactive systems.

"A key impediment to reinforcement learning (RL) in real applications with limited, batch data is defining a reward function that reflects what we implicitly know about reasonable behaviour for a task and allows for robust off-policy evaluation. In this work, we develop a method to identify an admissible set of reward functions for policies that (a) do not diverge too far from past behaviour, and (b) can be evaluated with high confidence, given only a collection of past trajectories. Together, these ensure that we propose policies that we trust to be implemented in high-risk settings.

"Title: ""Hybrid Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning in Parameterized Action Space""  Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise as a powerful technique for solving complex problems ranging from game playing to robotics. However, applying RL algorithms to real-world scenarios often requires careful design decisions regarding model architecture, training methodology, and exploration strategies. In particular, dealing with high-dimensional parameterized action spaces presents unique challenges that can significantly impact the effectiveness of learning algorithms.  To address these issues, we propose a hybrid actor-critic algorithm that combines traditional model-free policy optimization methods with value-based guidance. By combining both approaches in a judicious manner, our framework achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and overall performance across several benchmark tasks. Additionally, our approach allows for efficient use of computational resources by enabling parallelization of certain components during training.  Our results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method on a variety of environments and task domains, including continuous control tasks requiring fine motor manipulation, multi-agent settings involving competitive interaction, and other challenging RL scenarios. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards further democratizing RL research and promoting more widespread adoption of deep learning techniques in applied problem domains.",1
"Deep learning has enabled traditional reinforcement learning methods to deal with high-dimensional problems.

We also report the development of our own multi-agent environment called Multiple Tank Defence to simulate the proposed approach. The results show the significant performance improvement of multiple agents that have learned cooperatively with human strategies. This implies that there is a critical need for human intellect teamed with machines to solve complex problems. In addition, the success of this simulation indicates that our multi-agent environment can be used as a testbed platform to develop and validate other multi-agent control algorithms.",0

"We study the sample complexity of model-based reinforcement learning (henceforth RL) in general contextual decision processes that require strategic exploration to find a near-optimal policy. We design new algorithms for RL with a generic model class and analyze their statistical properties. Our algorithms have sample complexity governed by a new structural parameter called the witness rank, which we show to be small in several settings of interest, including factored MDPs. We also show that the witness rank is never larger than the recently proposed Bellman rank parameter governing the sample complexity of the model-free algorithm OLIVE (Jiang et al., 2017), the only other provably sample-efficient algorithm for global exploration at this level of generality. Focusing on the special case of factored MDPs, we prove an exponential lower bound for a general class of model-free approaches, including OLIVE, which, when combined with our algorithmic results, demonstrates exponential separation between model-based and model-free RL in some rich-observation settings.",0

"We study the sample complexity of approximate policy iteration (PI) for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), building on a recent line of work using LQR as a testbed to understand the limits of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on continuous control tasks. Our analysis quantifies the tension between policy improvement and policy evaluation, and suggests that policy evaluation is the dominant factor in terms of sample complexity. Specifically, we show that to obtain a controller that is within $\varepsilon$ of the optimal LQR controller, each step of policy evaluation requires at most $(n+d)^3/\varepsilon^2$ samples, where $n$ is the dimension of the state vector and $d$ is the dimension of the input vector. On the other hand, only $\log(1/\varepsilon)$ policy improvement steps suffice, resulting in an overall sample complexity of $(n+d)^3 \varepsilon^{-2} \log(1/\varepsilon)$. We furthermore build on our analysis and construct a simple adaptive procedure based on $\varepsilon$-greedy exploration which relies on approximate PI as a sub-routine and obtains $T^{2/3}$ regret, improving upon a recent result of Abbasi-Yadkori et al.",0

"Although reinforcement learning (RL) can provide reliable solutions in many settings, practitioners are often wary of the discrepancies between the RL solution and their status quo procedures. Therefore, they may be reluctant to adapt to the novel way of executing tasks proposed by RL. On the other hand, many real-world problems require relatively small adjustments from the status quo policies to achieve improved performance. Therefore, we propose a student-teacher RL mechanism in which the RL (the ""student"") learns to maximize its reward, subject to a constraint that bounds the difference between the RL policy and the ""teacher"" policy. The teacher can be another RL policy (e.g., trained under a slightly different setting), the status quo policy, or any other exogenous policy. We formulate this problem using a stochastic optimization model and solve it using a primal-dual policy gradient algorithm. We prove that the policy is asymptotically optimal. However, a naive implementation suffers from high variance and convergence to a stochastic optimal policy. With a few practical adjustments to address these issues, our numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method in multiple GridWorld scenarios.",0
"This study proposes a corrective reinforcement learning framework that explicitly considers both positive and negative human feedbacks to improve its performance. By designing such a framework, our model can balance exploration and exploitation based on online user feedback. We first use binary classification as a case study to show the effectiveness of our proposed method in simulation experiments. Then, we apply the corrected RL agent to another real application scenario and compare the results against those from two typical methods using either only rewards or penalties correction alone. Finally, considering these simulation and comparison experiments, we demonstrate how human teacher feedback helps our proposed corrective RL algorithm learn better than previous methods in more complex environments where accurate estimation of Q values is necessary. Our work paves the way towards developing intelligent agents capable of balancing exploration and exploitation while adapting to human preferences over time.",1
"Achieving faster execution with shorter compilation time can enable further diversity and innovation in neural networks. However, the current paradigm of executing neural networks either relies on hand-optimized libraries, traditional compilation heuristics, or very recently, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Our work takes a unique approach by formulating compiler optimizations for neural networks as a reinforcement learning problem, whose solution takes fewer steps to converge. This solution, dubbed ReLeASE, comes with a sampling algorithm that leverages clustering to focus the costly samples (real hardware measurements) on representative points, subsuming an entire subspace. Our adaptive sampling not only reduces the number of samples, but also improves the quality of samples for better exploration in shorter time. As such, experimentation with real hardware shows that reinforcement learning with adaptive sampling provides 4.45x speed up in optimization time over AutoTVM, while also improving inference time of the modern deep networks by 5.6%. Further experiments also confirm that our adaptive sampling can even improve AutoTVM's simulated annealing by 4.00x.",0

"This sounds like the basis for some interesting research! Without more context, I couldn't provide you with a complete abstract for your paper, but here is a brief outline that might help:  Abstract: ""Slowly evolving latent-state environments"" refers to situations where there may be underlying trends or changes happening over time that aren't immediately visible or easily predictable. In these kinds of environments, traditional decision-making approaches can struggle to keep up, making it difficult for agents (whether human or artificial) to make effective choices. However, recent advances in machine learning and computational modeling have led to the development of new techniques that could potentially help amplify the advantages of early adopters in such environments. By leveraging real-time data analysis and advanced simulation tools, these methods aim to enable faster identification of emerging opportunities and better strategic planning for future success. Our study explores how these advantage amplification mechanisms work and assesses their effectiveness under different assumptions and scenarios. We hope our findings contribute valuable insights into improving decision-making practices across various domains facing slow environmental change.""",1
"Understanding generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) is a significant challenge, as many common assumptions of traditional supervised learning theory do not apply. We focus on the special class of reparameterizable RL problems, where the trajectory distribution can be decomposed using the reparametrization trick. For this problem class, estimating the expected return is efficient and the trajectory can be computed deterministically given peripheral random variables, which enables us to study reparametrizable RL using supervised learning and transfer learning theory. Through these relationships, we derive guarantees on the gap between the expected and empirical return for both intrinsic and external errors, based on Rademacher complexity as well as the PAC-Bayes bound. Our bound suggests the generalization capability of reparameterizable RL is related to multiple factors including ""smoothness"" of the environment transition, reward and agent policy function class. We also empirically verify the relationship between the generalization gap and these factors through simulations.",0
"This study investigates the ""generalization gap"" phenomenon that occurs during reparameterizable reinforcement learning (RL). The generalization gap refers to the difference in performance between a RL agent trained on one task versus another similar task, even though both tasks share common characteristics and features. To explore this issue, we conducted experiments using several popular deep neural network architectures as well as different parameter sharing methods. Our results show that while some models are more susceptible to the generalization gap than others, there exists a consistent gap across all models regardless of their architecture or training methodology. We also found evidence suggesting that high model capacity exacerbates the generalization gap problem, further highlighting the importance of understanding how neural networks learn complex behaviors. Overall, our work provides insights into the limitations of current reparameterizable RL algorithms and sheds light on potential solutions towards achieving better generalization abilities in these systems.",1
"We revisit the stochastic variance-reduced policy gradient (SVRPG) method proposed by Papini et al. (2018) for reinforcement learning. We provide an improved convergence analysis of SVRPG and show that it can find an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the performance function within $O(1/\epsilon^{5/3})$ trajectories. This sample complexity improves upon the best known result $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ by a factor of $O(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$. At the core of our analysis is (i) a tighter upper bound for the variance of importance sampling weights, where we prove that the variance can be controlled by the parameter distance between different policies; and (ii) a fine-grained analysis of the epoch length and batch size parameters such that we can significantly reduce the number of trajectories required in each iteration of SVRPG.

"A universal rule-based self-learning approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for the first time to solve nonlinear ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. The solver consists of a deep neural network-structured actor that outputs candidate solutions, and a critic derived only from physical rules (governing equations and boundary and initial conditions). Solutions in discretized time are treated as multiple tasks sharing the same governing equation, and the current step parameters provide an ideal initialization for the next owing to the temporal continuity of the solutions, which shows a transfer learning characteristic and indicates that the DRL solver has captured the intrinsic nature of the equation. The approach is verified through solving the Schr\""odinger, Navier-Stokes, Burgers', Van der Pol, and Lorenz equations and an equation of motion. The results indicate that the approach gives solutions with high accuracy, and the solution process promises to get faster.",0
"In mathematics, solving nonlinear differential equations (NDEs) remains one of the most challenging tasks due to their complex nature and lack of general methods for finding exact solutions. Traditional analytical approaches often fail to provide closed-form expressions for NDEs that describe real-world phenomena in various fields such as engineering, physics, finance, biology, and others. Therefore, new techniques capable of handling these problems more effectively are highly desirable. This paper presents a novel method based on a rule-driven self-learning framework using deep reinforcement learning to find general solutions for arbitrary NDEs. Our approach operates in two stages: generating candidates and selecting the optimal solution. First, we generate a set of candidate solutions using symbolic computation, heuristics, and analytical approximations guided by rules adapted from the theory of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then, our system selects the most appropriate candidate based on the maximum reward received during evaluation, which involves both numerical accuracy and computational efficiency metrics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to various test cases from diverse domains, revealing promising results compared to existing solvers. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in addressing the issue of obtaining solutions for NDEs, paving the way for future advancements in automatic differentiation and symbolic computing.",1
"System identification of complex and nonlinear systems is a central problem for model predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning. Despite their complexity, such systems can often be approximated well by a set of linear dynamical systems if broken into appropriate subsequences. This mechanism not only helps us find good approximations of dynamics, but also gives us deeper insight into the underlying system. Leveraging Bayesian inference, Variational Autoencoders and Concrete relaxations, we show how to learn a richer and more meaningful state space, e.g. encoding joint constraints and collisions with walls in a maze, from partial and high-dimensional observations. This representation translates into a gain of accuracy of learned dynamics showcased on various simulated tasks.",0
"In recent years, variational inference has become increasingly popular as a method for approximating posterior distributions over latent variables in complex models. One common approach is variational Bayes filtering (VBF), which iteratively updates the belief state using variational Bayesian methods under known transition dynamics. However, VBF can suffer from limitations when dealing with unknown or uncertain transitions that cannot be easily modeled.  This paper proposes switching linear dynamics (SLD) as an alternative framework for VBF that allows for more flexible modeling of unknown transition dynamics. SLD combines multiple linear dynamic modes into one system, with each mode corresponding to a specific regime in the data generation process. By allowing different regimes to have their own unique dynamics, SLD is able to capture changes in underlying patterns that may occur during the sequence of observations.  The proposed approach is evaluated on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, showing improved accuracy compared to traditional VBF methods with static transition dynamics. Additionally, the benefits of SLD are demonstrated through comparisons to other switching dynamic frameworks commonly used in literature.  In conclusion, this work presents a novel and effective solution for addressing challenges associated with modeling unknown transition dynamics in variational Bayes filtering. The results demonstrate the potential impact of SLD across a variety of fields where sequential data analysis is crucial. Future research directions could involve exploring further extensions of SLD and investigating its performance on even more complex systems.",1
"In importance sampling (IS)-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), IS weights are typically clipped to avoid large variance in learning. However, policy update from clipped statistics induces large bias in tasks with high action dimensions, and bias from clipping makes it difficult to reuse old samples with large IS weights. In this paper, we consider PPO, a representative on-policy algorithm, and propose its improvement by dimension-wise IS weight clipping which separately clips the IS weight of each action dimension to avoid large bias and adaptively controls the IS weight to bound policy update from the current policy. This new technique enables efficient learning for high action-dimensional tasks and reusing of old samples like in off-policy learning to increase the sample efficiency. Numerical results show that the proposed new algorithm outperforms PPO and other RL algorithms in various Open AI Gym tasks.",0
"Incorporating model uncertainty into reinforcement learning algorithms has been shown to improve sample efficiency and reduce variance. One approach to incorporate uncertainty is through importance sampling weight clipping (ISC). ISC works by adjusting the relative probability of each state-action pair such that states that yield higher return under the current policy receive higher weights. However, previous methods only consider time homogeneous policies, meaning they assume equal stationary distributions across all dimensions at any given step. This neglects the inherent variability present across different dimensions. Our work proposes a novel extension of ISC called dimension-wise importance sampling weight clipping (DISC) which considers these time varying properties across each dimension separately. We show through extensive simulations DISC consistently outperforms traditional approaches, even without knowledge of ground truth rewards models. Further study highlighted significant reduction in regret when utilizing additional prior domain knowledge. Overall, our results suggest DISC as a valuable methodology, expanding the frontier of RL research.",1
"Though reinforcement learning has greatly benefited from the incorporation of neural networks, the inability to verify the correctness of such systems limits their use. Current work in explainable deep learning focuses on explaining only a single decision in terms of input features, making it unsuitable for explaining a sequence of decisions. To address this need, we introduce Abstracted Policy Graphs, which are Markov chains of abstract states. This representation concisely summarizes a policy so that individual decisions can be explained in the context of expected future transitions. Additionally, we propose a method to generate these Abstracted Policy Graphs for deterministic policies given a learned value function and a set of observed transitions, potentially off-policy transitions used during training. Since no restrictions are placed on how the value function is generated, our method is compatible with many existing reinforcement learning methods. We prove that the worst-case time complexity of our method is quadratic in the number of features and linear in the number of provided transitions, $O(|F|^2 |tr\_samples|)$. By applying our method to a family of domains, we show that our method scales well in practice and produces Abstracted Policy Graphs which reliably capture relationships within these domains.",0

"It would be desirable for a reinforcement learning (RL) based agent to learn behaviour by merely watching a demonstration. However, defining rewards that facilitate this goal within the RL paradigm remains a challenge. Here we address this problem with Siamese networks, trained to compute distances between observed behaviours and the agent's behaviours. Given a desired motion such Siamese networks can be used to provide a reward signal to an RL agent via the distance between the desired motion and the agent's motion. We experiment with an RNN-based comparator model that can compute distances in space and time between motion clips while training an RL policy to minimize this distance. Through experimentation, we have had also found that the inclusion of multi-task data and an additional image encoding loss helps enforce the temporal consistency. These two components appear to balance reward for matching a specific instance of behaviour versus that behaviour in general. Furthermore, we focus here on a particularly challenging form of this problem where only a single demonstration is provided for a given task -- the one-shot learning setting. We demonstrate our approach on humanoid agents in both 2D with $10$ degrees of freedom (DoF) and 3D with $38$ DoF.",0
"Abstract: Deep learning has made tremendous strides in recent years, revolutionizing how we approach computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, there remain many areas where these models struggle due to their reliance on large amounts of labeled data, including transferring learned knowledge from one task to another without retraining. In order to address these limitations, visual imitation learning (VIL) has emerged as a promising technique that leverages demonstrations of desired behaviors to learn new skills without explicit supervision. This work introduces recurrent Siamese networks (RSN), which extend existing VIL methods by utilizing deep recurrent neural network layers within contrastive frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate RSN achieves improved performance over alternative baselines across three complex benchmark datasets for sequential decision making problems involving pixel control tasks. Further analysis reveals insights into model interpretability, generalization capabilities, and training dynamics. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of combining reinforcement learning principles with more expressive architectures in VIL settings for enhanced problem solving abilities.",1

Our results suggest that these operators have strong potential for use in many different domains where RL is applied.",1
"The convergence of many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with linear function approximation has been investigated extensively but most proofs assume that these methods converge to a unique solution. In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of non-uniqueness issues for a large class of reinforcement learning algorithms, simultaneously unifying many counter-examples to convergence in a theoretical framework. We achieve this by proving a new condition on features that can determine whether the convergence assumptions are valid or non-uniqueness holds. We consider a general class of RL methods, which we call natural algorithms, whose solutions are characterized as the fixed point of a projected Bellman equation (when it exists); notably, bootstrapped temporal difference-based methods such as $TD(\lambda)$ and $GTD(\lambda)$ are natural algorithms. Our main result proves that natural algorithms converge to the correct solution if and only if all the value functions in the approximation space satisfy a certain shape. This implies that natural algorithms are, in general, inherently prone to converge to the wrong solution for most feature choices even if the value function can be represented exactly. Given our results, we show that state aggregation based features are a safe choice for natural algorithms and we also provide a condition for finding convergent algorithms under other feature constructions.",0
"In order for temporal difference (TD) methods to converge successfully they must have access to several key features such as accurate estimations and smoothness criteria. Specifically, TD learning algorithms need reliable estimates of state values to work properly and also require the use of appropriate smoothness constraints to prevent overestimation errors. Without these components, the methods may fail to reach convergence altogether. This paper explores the conditions necessary for TD methods to converge effectively and presents case studies demonstrating successful applications of these techniques. By identifying the importance of accurate estimation and smoothness criteria, researchers can better develop and refine their own implementations of TD learning methods. Ultimately, our findings contribute valuable insights into both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of TD methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems.",1
"A fundamental issue in reinforcement learning algorithms is the balance between exploration of the environment and exploitation of information already obtained by the agent. Especially, exploration has played a critical role for both efficiency and efficacy of the learning process. However, Existing works for exploration involve task-agnostic design, that is performing well in one environment, but be ill-suited to another. To the purpose of learning an effective and efficient exploration policy in an automated manner. We formalized a feasible metric for measuring the utility of exploration based on counterfactual ideology. Based on that, We proposed an end-to-end algorithm to learn exploration policy by meta-learning. We demonstrate that our method achieves good results compared to previous works in the high-dimensional control tasks in MuJoCo simulator.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advances in recent years due largely to deep reinforcement learning methods that enable agents to learn from trial and error in complex environments.

Our approach involves training an actor network to optimize an objective function based on counterfactuals, which allows us to evaluate policy quality beyond standard measures such as cumulative reward. We show through extensive simulations that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy of learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm generalizes well across different domains and tasks, highlighting its potential utility for real-world applications in areas such as robotics and computer vision. Overall, CMP represents an important step towards building intelligent agents capable of efficient and effective learning in complex environments.",1
"Reinforcement learning in multi-agent scenarios is important for real-world applications but presents challenges beyond those seen in single-agent settings. We present an actor-critic algorithm that trains decentralized policies in multi-agent settings, using centrally computed critics that share an attention mechanism which selects relevant information for each agent at every timestep. This attention mechanism enables more effective and scalable learning in complex multi-agent environments, when compared to recent approaches. Our approach is applicable not only to cooperative settings with shared rewards, but also individualized reward settings, including adversarial settings, as well as settings that do not provide global states, and it makes no assumptions about the action spaces of the agents. As such, it is flexible enough to be applied to most multi-agent learning problems.",0
"Incorporating human feedback during multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can lead to improved agent performance by explicitly aligning agents towards achieving collective goals.

Our approach enables agents to focus their attentions on specific aspects of the environment while preserving their autonomy, thus improving policy optimality. Evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods in addressing issues related to non-optimal policies and subpar human evaluations.

"A Budgeted Markov Decision Process (BMDP) is an extension of a Markov Decision Process to critical applications requiring safety constraints. It relies on a notion of risk implemented in the shape of a cost signal constrained to lie below an - adjustable - threshold. So far, BMDPs could only be solved in the case of finite state spaces with known dynamics. This work extends the state-of-the-art to continuous spaces environments and unknown dynamics. We show that the solution to a BMDP is a fixed point of a novel Budgeted Bellman Optimality operator. This observation allows us to introduce natural extensions of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to address large-scale BMDPs. We validate our approach on two simulated applications: spoken dialogue and autonomous driving.",0

Our approach uses Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the environment and update estimates of expected reward values. Additionally, we use value function approximation to handle the high-dimensionality of the state space and ensure scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through simulations on multiple benchmark tasks and compare results against other prominent BRL algorithms. Results show consistent improvements across all scenarios, highlighting the promise of our new approach. Ultimately, our algorithm offers an important contribution towards enabling efficient decision making under uncertainty in complex and uncertain environments.",1
"The performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm can vary drastically during learning because of exploration. Existing algorithms provide little information about the quality of their current policy before executing it, and thus have limited use in high-stakes applications like healthcare. We address this lack of accountability by proposing that algorithms output policy certificates. These certificates bound the sub-optimality and return of the policy in the next episode, allowing humans to intervene when the certified quality is not satisfactory. We further introduce two new algorithms with certificates and present a new framework for theoretical analysis that guarantees the quality of their policies and certificates. For tabular MDPs, we show that computing certificates can even improve the sample-efficiency of optimism-based exploration. As a result, one of our algorithms is the first to achieve minimax-optimal PAC bounds up to lower-order terms, and this algorithm also matches (and in some settings slightly improves upon) existing minimax regret bounds.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to make decisions and control systems in complex and uncertain environments. However, one challenge facing RL is that it can be difficult to ensure accountability for these decisions, particularly if they have negative consequences. To address this issue, we propose the use of policy certificates as a means of verifying the safety and reliability of RL policies.  A policy certificate is a formal guarantee that a given RL policy satisfies certain properties such as safety or optimality, subject to some assumptions on the environment or problem structure. These certificates allow us to establish bounds on the performance of the policy and provide evidence that it will behave appropriately in different scenarios.  Our approach combines techniques from both model checking and probabilistic analysis to efficiently compute policy certificates for RL policies operating in uncertain environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and experiments on real-world problems, showing that policy certificates can significantly improve confidence in the decisions made by RL agents. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications of our work in domains where high levels of accountability are required, such as finance and healthcare.  Overall, our work contributes towards building more transparent and reliable RL algorithms that can operate in challenging and unpredictable settings while ensuring accountability for their actions. By providing rigorous guarantees on the behavior of RL policies, we aim to move closer to the goal of trustworthy AI systems.",1
"Policy gradient methods ignore the potential value of adjusting environment variables: unobservable state features that are randomly determined by the environment in a physical setting, but are controllable in a simulator. This can lead to slow learning, or convergence to suboptimal policies, if the environment variable has a large impact on the transition dynamics. In this paper, we present fingerprint policy optimisation (FPO), which finds a policy that is optimal in expectation across the distribution of environment variables. The central idea is to use Bayesian optimisation (BO) to actively select the distribution of the environment variable that maximises the improvement generated by each iteration of the policy gradient method. To make this BO practical, we contribute two easy-to-compute low-dimensional fingerprints of the current policy. Our experiments show that FPO can efficiently learn policies that are robust to significant rare events, which are unlikely to be observable under random sampling, but are key to learning good policies.",0
"Abstract: This research focuses on improving performance in reinforcement learning tasks by optimising fingerprint policy selection. Previous studies have shown that using multiple policies can improve robustness and stability in learning outcomes. However, selecting which set of policies to use during training remains an open problem. We propose a method for systematically choosing fingerprint policies based on their effectiveness at identifying optimal actions in different state representations. Our experimental results show significant improvements over random selection and other heuristics, demonstrating that our approach leads to more efficient exploration and better final performance in several benchmark environments. Further analysis reveals insights into how specific types of policies excel under certain conditions, providing new understanding of the tradeoffs involved when combining diverse strategies in RL algorithms. By addressing this crucial aspect of multi-policy methods, we advance the field of robust reinforcement learning and facilitate application in real-world problems characterised by uncertain or rapidly changing dynamics.",1
"Value functions are crucial for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) to obtain a policy implicitly or guide the policy updates. Value estimation heavily depends on the stochasticity of environmental dynamics and the quality of reward signals. In this paper, we propose a two-step understanding of value estimation from the perspective of future prediction, through decomposing the value function into a reward-independent future dynamics part and a policy-independent trajectory return part. We then derive a practical deep RL algorithm from the above decomposition, consisting of a convolutional trajectory representation model, a conditional variational dynamics model to predict the expected representation of future trajectory and a convex trajectory return model that maps a trajectory representation to its return. Our algorithm is evaluated in MuJoCo continuous control tasks and shows superior results under both common settings and delayed reward settings.",0
"This paper presents an approach to decomposing value functions into their underlying components by explicitly modeling the dynamics and returns associated with each action. We show how future prediction can be used to disentangle the effects of different actions on the state distribution over time, allowing us to recover interpretable representations that capture both short-term rewards and longer-term consequences. Our method achieves strong performance on a variety of continuous control tasks across multiple domains, outperforming previous approaches based on handcrafted features or other forms of decomposition. We also provide theoretical analysis that demonstrates the soundness and robustness of our framework, as well as empirical evidence showing its ability to identify meaningful patterns in complex environments. By unlocking new opportunities for understanding and exploiting value function structure, we hope our work will spur further progress towards human-level artificial intelligence.",1
"Exploration is an extremely challenging problem in reinforcement learning, especially in high dimensional state and action spaces and when only sparse rewards are available. Effective representations can indicate which components of the state are task relevant and thus reduce the dimensionality of the space to explore. In this work, we take a representation learning viewpoint on exploration, utilizing prior experience to learn effective latent representations, which can subsequently indicate which regions to explore. Prior experience on separate but related tasks help learn representations of the state which are effective at predicting instantaneous rewards. These learned representations can then be used with an entropy-based exploration method to effectively perform exploration in high dimensional spaces by effectively lowering the dimensionality of the search space. We show the benefits of this representation for meta-exploration in a simulated object pushing environment.",0
"""Abstract: Despite impressive recent progress made by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods in solving complex problems across multiple domains, one key challenge that remains unsolved is the issue of sample efficiency. DRL agents often require millions or billions of interactions with their environment before they can perform well on challenging tasks—a significant obstacle given that even simple physical simulations may take hours or days at real time speeds. In this work we propose two novel techniques that address these issues in actor-critic methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our first technique learns a continuous latent embedding space from experience, where states close in distance correspond roughly to nearby trajectory segments. We use this to improve data compression during training while still maintaining good policy performance. With this latent state representation learned end-to-end via supervised pretraining, we then go on to introduce our second contribution: model-free offline RL. By using a learned latent transition model trained separately on stored experiences of old policies, we can leverage a powerful probabilistic model to simulate trajectories efficiently without interacting with the original environment. These simulation errors give rise to new, noisy Q values which we learn online through self-supervision. When combined together both components lead to greatly reduced amounts of interaction required for achieving high levels of performance compared to previous state-of-the-art results. On six classic continuous control tasks, our agent outperforms prior PPO baselines under equivalent number of episodes trained; reaching near-optimal scores after only tens of thousands of timesteps of interaction instead.""",1
"Reinforcement Learning agents are expected to eventually perform well. Typically, this takes the form of a guarantee about the asymptotic behavior of an algorithm given some assumptions about the environment. We present an algorithm for a policy whose value approaches the optimal value with probability 1 in all computable probabilistic environments, provided the agent has a bounded horizon. This is known as strong asymptotic optimality, and it was previously unknown whether it was possible for a policy to be strongly asymptotically optimal in the class of all computable probabilistic environments. Our agent, Inquisitive Reinforcement Learner (Inq), is more likely to explore the more it expects an exploratory action to reduce its uncertainty about which environment it is in, hence the term inquisitive. Exploring inquisitively is a strategy that can be applied generally; for more manageable environment classes, inquisitiveness is tractable. We conducted experiments in ""grid-worlds"" to compare the Inquisitive Reinforcement Learner to other weakly asymptotically optimal agents.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can perform optimally in complex environments. One approach to achieving this goal is through the use of reinforcement learning algorithms, which allow agents to learn optimal policies by trial and error. However, these algorithms often suffer from slow convergence rates and may fail to find near-optimal solutions in high-dimensional state spaces or problems with delayed rewards.  To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm called SARAH (Strongly Adaptive Randomized Approximately Hessian), which combines the strengths of both model-free and model-based RL methods. Our method uses randomization to ensure exploration while adaptively adjusting the tradeoff between model accuracy and data efficiency. We show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based methods on a range of benchmark tasks, including both continuous control problems and discrete action spaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to scale up to high-dimensional state spaces by solving a challenging problem involving learning to walk in real-world simulation environments.  Our results suggest that strongly asymptotically optimal behavior can be achieved using deep neural network function approximators across diverse domains, without reliance on prior domain knowledge beyond general convexity assumptions.

Rule-based algorithms are required in safety-critical applications for them to work properly in a wide range of situations. Hence, every effort is made to find failure scenarios during the development phase. However, as the software becomes complicated, finding failure cases becomes difficult. Especially in multi-agent domains, such as autonomous driving environments, it is much harder to find useful failure scenarios that help us improve the algorithm. We propose a method for efficiently finding failure scenarios; this method trains the adversarial agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning such that the tested rule-based agent fails.

"Joint replacement is the most common inpatient surgical treatment in the US. We investigate the clinical pathway optimization for knee replacement, which is a sequential decision process from onset to recovery. Based on episodic claims from previous cases, we view the pathway optimization as an intelligence crowdsourcing problem and learn the optimal decision policy from data by imitating the best expert at every intermediate state. We develop a reinforcement learning-based pipeline that uses value iteration, state compression and aggregation learning, kernel representation and cross validation to predict the best treatment policy. It also provides forecast of the clinical pathway under the optimized policy. Empirical validation shows that the optimized policy reduces the overall cost by 7 percent and reduces the excessive cost premium by 33 percent.",0

"We introduce a new RL problem where the agent is required to generalize to a previously-unseen environment characterized by a subtask graph which describes a set of subtasks and their dependencies. Unlike existing hierarchical multitask RL approaches that explicitly describe what the agent should do at a high level, our problem only describes properties of subtasks and relationships among them, which requires the agent to perform complex reasoning to find the optimal subtask to execute. To solve this problem, we propose a neural subtask graph solver (NSGS) which encodes the subtask graph using a recursive neural network embedding. To overcome the difficulty of training, we propose a novel non-parametric gradient-based policy, graph reward propagation, to pre-train our NSGS agent and further finetune it through actor-critic method. The experimental results on two 2D visual domains show that our agent can perform complex reasoning to find a near-optimal way of executing the subtask graph and generalize well to the unseen subtask graphs. In addition, we compare our agent with a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) method showing that our method is much more efficient than MCTS, and the performance of NSGS can be further improved by combining it with MCTS.",0
"The field of artificial intelligence has seen rapid advancements over recent years due to breakthroughs in deep learning techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL). RL algorithms have been shown to perform well in a variety of domains, including games, robotics, and natural language processing. However, one major challenge facing current RL methods is their lack of ability to generalize across tasks, even those that share similar structures. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical approach to RL which allows agents to learn multiple subtasks within larger tasks and generalize to unseen tasks using zero-shot learning. Our method takes into account the dependencies among these subtasks by modeling them through a set of directed graphs. We show that our approach achieves significantly better performance on standard benchmark problems compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

"In many finite horizon episodic reinforcement learning (RL) settings, it is desirable to optimize for the undiscounted return - in settings like Atari, for instance, the goal is to collect the most points while staying alive in the long run. Yet, it may be difficult (or even intractable) mathematically to learn with this target. As such, temporal discounting is often applied to optimize over a shorter effective planning horizon. This comes at the risk of potentially biasing the optimization target away from the undiscounted goal. In settings where this bias is unacceptable - where the system must optimize for longer horizons at higher discounts - the target of the value function approximator may increase in variance leading to difficulties in learning. We present an extension of temporal difference (TD) learning, which we call TD($\Delta$), that breaks down a value function into a series of components based on the differences between value functions with smaller discount factors. The separation of a longer horizon value function into these components has useful properties in scalability and performance. We discuss these properties and show theoretic and empirical improvements over standard TD learning in certain settings.",0
"This paper presents a method for separating an agent's overall objective function into multiple subgoals that can each be achieved at different timescales. By breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, agents can focus on one goal at a time without sacrificing progress towards their larger objectives. The proposed approach involves identifying key aspects of the environment, defining priorities based on those factors, and then creating separate value functions for each priority level. These value functions can operate independently, allowing agents to make decisions that balance short-term gains against long-term benefits. Experiments demonstrate that the new method outperforms traditional single-timescale reinforcement learning techniques in several domains. Overall, our results suggest that splitting an agent's objective function across multiple timescales is an effective means of improving performance and adaptability.",1
"Recent advances in reinforcement learning have proved that given an environment we can learn to perform a task in that environment if we have access to some form of a reward function (dense, sparse or derived from IRL). But most of the algorithms focus on learning a single best policy to perform a given set of tasks. In this paper, we focus on an algorithm that learns to not just perform a task but different ways to perform the same task. As we know when the environment is complex enough there always exists multiple ways to perform a task. We show that using the concept of information maximization it is possible to learn latent codes for discovering multiple ways to perform any given task in an environment.",0
"In today’s world, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become increasingly prevalent and complex, making their behavior difficult to interpret. As these AI systems interact more closely with human users and other stakeholders, there is a pressing need for increased transparency and accountability in how they make decisions. One approach that has been proposed to address this issue is interpretable reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we present InfoRL, a new methodology for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of RL algorithms by formulating them as information maximizers. This framework combines the power of deep neural networks commonly used in modern AI with classical decision theory from economics and game theory. By training agents to seek out informative experiences and act optimally on that basis, InfoRL can generate policies that can be readily explained and understood by humans. We evaluate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional RL methods in terms of both task performance and interpretability. Our findings suggest that InfoRL represents a promising direction towards responsible and explainable AI systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has had many successes in both ""deep"" and ""shallow"" settings. In both cases, significant hyperparameter tuning is often required to achieve good performance. Furthermore, when nonlinear function approximation is used, non-stationarity in the state representation can lead to learning instability. A variety of techniques exist to combat this --- most notably large experience replay buffers or the use of multiple parallel actors. These techniques come at the cost of moving away from the online RL problem as it is traditionally formulated (i.e., a single agent learning online without maintaining a large database of training examples). Meta-learning can potentially help with both these issues by tuning hyperparameters online and allowing the algorithm to more robustly adjust to non-stationarity in a problem. This paper applies meta-gradient descent to derive a set of step-size tuning algorithms specifically for online RL control with eligibility traces. Our novel technique, Metatrace, makes use of an eligibility trace analogous to methods like $TD(\lambda)$. We explore tuning both a single scalar step-size and a separate step-size for each learned parameter. We evaluate Metatrace first for control with linear function approximation in the classic mountain car problem and then in a noisy, non-stationary version. Finally, we apply Metatrace for control with nonlinear function approximation in 5 games in the Arcade Learning Environment where we explore how it impacts learning speed and robustness to initial step-size choice. Results show that the meta-step-size parameter of Metatrace is easy to set, Metatrace can speed learning, and Metatrace can allow an RL algorithm to deal with non-stationarity in the learning task.",0
"Abstract Modern applications such as self-driving vehicles and robots require adaptive decision making based on sensor inputs. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for these tasks due to its ability to learn control policies directly from trial and error interactions with complex environments. However, training RL agents remains challenging, especially in high-dimensional state spaces where exploration and exploitation tradeoffs must be carefully balanced. To address this challenge, we propose Metatrace Actor-Critic (MAT), which uses meta-gradient descent (MD) to adapt the step size (TS) hyperparameter in online TD(lambda)-based actorcritic methods. MAT achieves efficient adaptation of the TS using a simple and computationally cheap update rule without relying on model parallelization or experience buffering. We demonstrate through extensive experimental results that our proposed method effectively tunes the agent parameters during interaction time, resulting in improved performance over current state-of-the art methods across several benchmark tasks. These findings suggest the potential of MD techniques for enabling robust and adaptive decision making in realtime applications under uncertainty.",1
"Automatic machine learning is an important problem in the forefront of machine learning. The strongest AutoML systems are based on neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and Bayesian optimization. Recently AlphaD3M reached state-of-the-art results with an order of magnitude speedup using reinforcement learning with self-play. In this work we extend AlphaD3M by using a pipeline grammar and a pre-trained model which generalizes from many different datasets and similar tasks. Our results demonstrate improved performance compared with our earlier work and existing methods on AutoML benchmark datasets for classification and regression tasks. In the spirit of reproducible research we make our data, models, and code publicly available.",0
"In recent years, machine learning has become increasingly important in many fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. However, designing efficient machine learning models remains a challenging task due to the large number of parameters that need to be tuned manually to achieve good results. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach called ""Automatic Machine Learning by Pipeline Synthesis"" (AutoML), which combines model-based reinforcement learning and grammar to automatically generate machine learning pipelines tailored to specific tasks. We evaluate our approach on three diverse benchmark datasets and show that AutoML outperforms state-of-the-art baseline algorithms while requiring significantly less time and computational resources. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using grammatical structure as a prior knowledge to guide automatic machine learning research, with promising implications for reducing manual effort required to build high-quality machine learning systems. This work highlights the synergy between deep learning and symbolic methods, paving the way towards next generation automation tools that can harness both paradigms effectively to enable faster innovation cycles in Artificial Intelligence.",1
"Recent reinforcement learning algorithms, though achieving impressive results in various fields, suffer from brittle training effects such as regression in results and high sensitivity to initialization and parameters. We claim that some of the brittleness stems from variance differences, i.e. when different environment areas - states and/or actions - have different rewards variance. This causes two problems: First, the ""Boring Areas Trap"" in algorithms such as Q-learning, where moving between areas depends on the current area variance, and getting out of a boring area is hard due to its low variance. Second, the ""Manipulative Consultant"" problem, when value-estimation functions used in DQN and Actor-Critic algorithms influence the agent to prefer boring areas, regardless of the mean rewards return, as they maximize estimation precision rather than rewards. This sheds a new light on how exploration contribute to training, as it helps with both challenges. Cognitive experiments in humans showed that noised reward signals may paradoxically improve performance. We explain this using the two mentioned problems, claiming that both humans and algorithms may share similar challenges. Inspired by this result, we propose the Adaptive Symmetric Reward Noising (ASRN), by which we mean adding Gaussian noise to rewards according to their states' estimated variance, thus avoiding the two problems while not affecting the environment's mean rewards behavior. We conduct our experiments in a Multi Armed Bandit problem with variance differences. We demonstrate that a Q-learning algorithm shows the brittleness effect in this problem, and that the ASRN scheme can dramatically improve the results. We show that ASRN helps a DQN algorithm training process reach better results in an end to end autonomous driving task using the AirSim driving simulator.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), noisy rewards have proven to be effective in improving the stability and robustness of algorithms. However, current methods for adding noise are static, meaning they add the same amount of noise across all episodes, regardless of how well the agent performs. We propose adaptive symmetric reward noising (ASRN), which dynamically adjusts the amount of noise based on the performance of the agent. ASRN balances the desire for low variance and high precision by tuning the noise level using a learned scale factor that updates as the agent learns. Our experimental results show that ASRN leads to improved performance compared to static noising methods and achieves better results than state-of-the-art baselines on both continuous control tasks and Atari games. These findings demonstrate the potential of ASRN as a powerful tool for enhancing RL algorithms' ability to learn quickly and efficiently in complex environments.",1
"The optimal predictor for a linear dynamical system (with hidden state and Gaussian noise) takes the form of an autoregressive linear filter, namely the Kalman filter. However, a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning and control theory is to make optimal predictions in an unknown dynamical system. To this end, we take the approach of directly learning an autoregressive filter for time-series prediction under unknown dynamics. Our analysis differs from previous statistical analyses in that we regress not only on the inputs to the dynamical system, but also the outputs, which is essential to dealing with process noise. The main challenge is to estimate the filter under worst case input (in $\mathcal H_\infty$ norm), for which we use an $L^\infty$-based objective rather than ordinary least-squares. For learning an autoregressive model, our algorithm has optimal sample complexity in terms of the rollout length, which does not seem to be attained by naive least-squares.",0
"Learning an autoregressive (AR) model has been shown as a simple yet effective approach for time series forecasting tasks under stationary assumptions. In practice, however, real world data often violate these assumptions due to changes over time, missing values, outliers etc., leading to poor generalization performance or failure during inference when using standard AR models. Our work addresses this problem by providing robust theoretical guarantees on the performance of an appropriate modification of the standard AR model that can cope well with many common forms of variability present in nonstationary time series. For a wide range of conditions we prove guaranteed bounds on the error of our modified AR model, showing state-of-the-art empirical performance across multiple domains including financial markets, solar energy generation, internet traffic analysis, speech signal processing, among others. In summary, our contributions demonstrate the feasibility of addressing challenging time series related problems in applications of great interest without requiring complex deep architectures or access to large amounts of training data, while still matching the best existing methods. We hope our findings will aid researchers and practitioners alike in effectively dealing with the intricacies and difficulties associated with non-stationarity, opening new doors for application-focused investigations into important phenomena involving temporal data patterns.",1
"Despite recent innovations in network architectures and loss functions, training RNNs to learn long-term dependencies remains difficult due to challenges with gradient-based optimisation methods. Inspired by the success of Deep Neuroevolution in reinforcement learning (Such et al. 2017), we explore the use of gradient-free population-based global optimisation (PBO) techniques -- training RNNs to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data. Testing evolution strategies (ES) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) on an application in volatility forecasting, we demonstrate that PBO methods lead to performance improvements in general, with ES exhibiting the most consistent results across a variety of architectures.",0
"Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been applied extensively over recent years due to their ability to model complex sequential data structures, such as speech signals, music melodies, natural language sequences and many others. With their internal memory they can even capture quite subtle long term dependencies that traditional feedforward neural networks would fail to learn. However, training these models is often challenging because it needs to find all those hidden weights and biases which result into most accurate prediction over the whole sequence length. To achieve better generalization performance in terms of accuracy and capacity we propose three population based optimization methods: Evolutionary Strategies(ES), Covariance Matrix Adaptation(CMA)-ES and Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO). These algorithms show very competitive results compared against simple gradient descent backpropagation (BP) using cross entropy loss function. Moreover, the proposed methods are able to exploit special features provided by recurrent nets and significantly speed up the learning process on large datasets. This research work therefore provides valuable insights, novel approaches and implementations towards solving practical machine learning tasks that involve long term dependencies of varying nature. Our future goal is focused on extending and generalizing our approach onto alternative families of RNNs architectures.",1
"Recent work has explored the problem of autonomous navigation by imitating a teacher and learning an end-to-end policy, which directly predicts controls from raw images. However, these approaches tend to be sensitive to mistakes by the teacher and do not scale well to other environments or vehicles. To this end, we propose Observational Imitation Learning (OIL), a novel imitation learning variant that supports online training and automatic selection of optimal behavior by observing multiple imperfect teachers. We apply our proposed methodology to the challenging problems of autonomous driving and UAV racing. For both tasks, we utilize the Sim4CV simulator that enables the generation of large amounts of synthetic training data and also allows for online learning and evaluation. We train a perception network to predict waypoints from raw image data and use OIL to train another network to predict controls from these waypoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained network outperforms its teachers, conventional imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) baselines and even humans in simulation.

We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that OIL outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both task success rate and generalization ability across different environments and initial conditions. Our results showcase the potential of observational learning as a powerful tool for robotic control and open up new possibilities for using machine learning to achieve adaptive robot behaviors.  ---  Hello!

"Despite recent successes in Reinforcement Learning, value-based methods often suffer from high variance hindering performance. In this paper, we illustrate this in a continuous control setting where state of the art methods perform poorly whenever sensor noise is introduced. To overcome this issue, we introduce Recurrent Value Functions (RVFs) as an alternative to estimate the value function of a state. We propose to estimate the value function of the current state using the value function of past states visited along the trajectory. Due to the nature of their formulation, RVFs have a natural way of learning an emphasis function that selectively emphasizes important states. First, we establish RVF's asymptotic convergence properties in tabular settings. We then demonstrate their robustness on a partially observable domain and continuous control tasks. Finally, we provide a qualitative interpretation of the learned emphasis function.",0

"In the space of only a few years, deep generative modeling has revolutionized how we think of artificial creativity, yielding autonomous systems which produce original images, music, and text. Inspired by these successes, researchers are now applying deep generative modeling techniques to the generation and optimization of molecules - in our review we found 45 papers on the subject published in the past two years. These works point to a future where such systems will be used to generate lead molecules, greatly reducing resources spent downstream synthesizing and characterizing bad leads in the lab. In this review we survey the increasingly complex landscape of models and representation schemes that have been proposed. The four classes of techniques we describe are recursive neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning. After first discussing some of the mathematical fundamentals of each technique, we draw high level connections and comparisons with other techniques and expose the pros and cons of each. Several important high level themes emerge as a result of this work, including the shift away from the SMILES string representation of molecules towards more sophisticated representations such as graph grammars and 3D representations, the importance of reward function design, the need for better standards for benchmarking and testing, and the benefits of adversarial training and reinforcement learning over maximum likelihood based training.",0

"Phishing is the simplest form of cybercrime with the objective of baiting people into giving away delicate information such as individually recognizable data, banking and credit card details, or even credentials and passwords. This type of simple yet most effective cyber-attack is usually launched through emails, phone calls, or instant messages. The credential or private data stolen are then used to get access to critical records of the victims and can result in extensive fraud and monetary loss. Hence, sending malicious messages to victims is a stepping stone of the phishing procedure. A \textit{phisher} usually setups a deceptive website, where the victims are conned into entering credentials and sensitive information. It is therefore important to detect these types of malicious websites before causing any harmful damages to victims. Inspired by the evolving nature of the phishing websites, this paper introduces a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning to model and detect malicious URLs. The proposed model is capable of adapting to the dynamic behavior of the phishing websites and thus learn the features associated with phishing website detection.",0

"Legged locomotion is a challenging task for learning algorithms, especially when the task requires a diverse set of primitive behaviors. To solve these problems, we introduce a hierarchical framework to automatically decompose complex locomotion tasks. A high-level policy issues commands in a latent space and also selects for how long the low-level policy will execute the latent command. Concurrently, the low-level policy uses the latent command and only the robot's on-board sensors to control the robot's actuators. Our approach allows the high-level policy to run at a lower frequency than the low-level one. We test our framework on a path-following task for a dynamic quadruped robot and we show that steering behaviors automatically emerge in the latent command space as low-level skills are needed for this task. We then show efficient adaptation of the trained policy to a different task by transfer of the trained low-level policy. Finally, we validate the policies on a real quadruped robot. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of end-to-end hierarchical learning to a real robotic locomotion task.",0
"This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training quadrupeds to walk on different terrains. We propose a two-level hierarchy consisting of a high-level policy that plans stable footholds and a low-level policy that executes gaits. Both policies interact through shared parameters and mutual guidance to optimize overall performance. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods across various challenging environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating task decomposition into RL for improving locomotion skills. Our framework paves the way for developing more advanced legged robots capable of navigating complex real-world settings autonomously.",1
"Branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithms are widely used to solve combinatorial problems, and the performance crucially depends on its branching heuristic.In this work, we consider a typical problem of maximum common subgraph (MCS), and propose a branching heuristic inspired from reinforcement learning with a goal of reaching a tree leaf as early as possible to greatly reduce the search tree size.Extensive experiments show that our method is beneficial and outperforms current best BnB algorithm for the MCS.",0
Solving Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) problems involves finding the largest common subgraph that two graphs share in linear time complexity. One popular algorithm for solving MCS problems is the branch and bound method which consists of recursively exploring the search space and pruning nodes that cannot contain solutions. In our work we present a novel learning-based approach to improve the efficiency of the branch and bind method by making use of precomputation of upper bounds on node values obtained through machine learning models trained on synthetic data. We show experimentally that our proposed approach significantly reduces the number of iterations required by the solver while providing competitive running times compared against state-of-the art methods. Our work has applications in graph alignment and network analysis where MCS problems arise frequently and scalability is important.,1
"N-discount optimality was introduced as a hierarchical form of policy- and value-function optimality, with Blackwell optimality lying at the top level of the hierarchy Veinott (1969); Blackwell (1962). We formalize notions of myopic discount factors, value functions and policies in terms of Blackwell optimality in MDPs, and we provide a novel concept of regret, called Blackwell regret, which measures the regret compared to a Blackwell optimal policy. Our main analysis focuses on long horizon MDPs with sparse rewards. We show that selecting the discount factor under which zero Blackwell regret can be achieved becomes arbitrarily hard. Moreover, even with oracle knowledge of such a discount factor that can realize a Blackwell regret-free value function, an $\epsilon$-Blackwell optimal value function may not even be gain optimal. Difficulties associated with this class of problems is discussed, and the notion of a policy gap is defined as the difference in expected return between a given policy and any other policy that differs at that state; we prove certain properties related to this gap. Finally, we provide experimental results that further support our theoretical results.",0
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant progress in recent years due to advances in deep learning techniques that have enabled agents to learn complex behaviors from raw sensor inputs without manual engineering. Despite these advances, several key issues still remain unresolved, including the achievability of Blackwell optimal policies which aim to maximize expected cumulative reward over time. In practice, achieving such optimality remains challenging due to a lack of knowledge regarding environment dynamics, uncertainty, partial observability, computational intractability, and other factors. This paper discusses these issues and presents alternative approaches for approximating solutions to RL problems where perfect knowledge may not always be feasible. Our work builds upon prior research in approximate dynamic programming methods such as Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradient methods, and more advanced neurocomputational models inspired by biological brains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through numerical simulations on standard benchmark tasks, highlighting their potential for addressing some of the open problems facing contemporary RL applications. Ultimately, we believe that continued advancements in RL require addressing the issues surrounding the realization of optimal policies under limited domain knowledge or computational tractability. Our contributions aim to push forward towards that goal while offering new insights into how RL can solve sequential decision making problems ranging from robotics to finance and beyond.",1
"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have achieved human-level performance on a variety of real-world applications. However, the current algorithms still suffer from poor gradient estimation with excessive variance, resulting in unstable training and poor sample efficiency. In our paper, we proposed an innovative optimization strategy by utilizing stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) techniques. With extensive experiments on Atari domain, our method outperforms the deep q-learning baselines on 18 out of 20 games.",0
"This paper presents a new method for reducing variance in deep reinforcement learning algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By incorporating uncertainty estimates into the SGD updates, our approach can adaptively adjust the step size and achieve improved stability and efficiency compared to traditional methods that rely solely on heuristics. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over several benchmark tasks, including both continuous control problems and discrete game environments. Additionally, we show how the proposed method generalizes across different architectures and training settings, making it a flexible option for practitioners working on various domains and problem sizes. Overall, these results suggest that our method has the potential to significantly impact the field of deep RL by improving sample complexity, speeding up convergence, and enabling more accurate exploration and exploitation tradeoffs.",1
"The field of reinforcement learning (RL) is facing increasingly challenging domains with combinatorial complexity. For an RL agent to address these challenges, it is essential that it can plan effectively. Prior work has typically utilized an explicit model of the environment, combined with a specific planning algorithm (such as tree search). More recently, a new family of methods have been proposed that learn how to plan, by providing the structure for planning via an inductive bias in the function approximator (such as a tree structured neural network), trained end-to-end by a model-free RL algorithm. In this paper, we go even further, and demonstrate empirically that an entirely model-free approach, without special structure beyond standard neural network components such as convolutional networks and LSTMs, can learn to exhibit many of the characteristics typically associated with a model-based planner. We measure our agent's effectiveness at planning in terms of its ability to generalize across a combinatorial and irreversible state space, its data efficiency, and its ability to utilize additional thinking time. We find that our agent has many of the characteristics that one might expect to find in a planning algorithm. Furthermore, it exceeds the state-of-the-art in challenging combinatorial domains such as Sokoban and outperforms other model-free approaches that utilize strong inductive biases toward planning.",0
"""Model free"" refers to machine learning algorithms which use rewards (rather than explicit models) that can drive optimal decision making given some exploration-exploitation balance (e.g., epsilon greedy policy). This class of methods are relevant to many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks including robotics, video games, autonomous vehicles, personal assistants like ChatGPT, etc. Model Free Planning refers specifically to finding decision paths / control policies that approximately maximize summed future reward from a given state -- without assuming any statistical model for how actions change state transitions probabilities. In this work we empirically compare several ways to make these decisions: (1) uniform random choice among legal next actions, (2) a novel method based on gradient ascent in policy space with respect to expected total discounted reward starting from each state (""Gradient Ascent Random Policy""), and (3) using the most recent visitation count of states (""count-based"") as the probability used in determining policy choices at each step. For all three methods we add exploration by adding noise proportional to the time elapsed since the last action was taken; this can either be added uniformly across all possible next actions, or only added to the currently chosen action to favor more novel actions earlier. We study both batch performance (across multiple episodes), and average episodic return versus training steps. All methods are trained against a single variant of MountainCarContinuous where the initial position is sampled randomly from [-6,-4] and we report results over 10 different seeds for each method so as to show the distribution of outcomes obtained. Experiments suggest that while simple baselines perform surprisingly well in our task suite, Gradient Ascent Random Policy consistently produces higher expected episodi",1
"Experience replay (ER) is a fundamental component of off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL). ER recalls experiences from past iterations to compute gradient estimates for the current policy, increasing data-efficiency. However, the accuracy of such updates may deteriorate when the policy diverges from past behaviors and can undermine the performance of ER. Many algorithms mitigate this issue by tuning hyper-parameters to slow down policy changes. An alternative is to actively enforce the similarity between policy and the experiences in the replay memory. We introduce Remember and Forget Experience Replay (ReF-ER), a novel method that can enhance RL algorithms with parameterized policies. ReF-ER (1) skips gradients computed from experiences that are too unlikely with the current policy and (2) regulates policy changes within a trust region of the replayed behaviors. We couple ReF-ER with Q-learning, deterministic policy gradient and off-policy gradient methods. We find that ReF-ER consistently improves the performance of continuous-action, off-policy RL on fully observable benchmarks and partially observable flow control problems.",0
"This study investigates the influence of experience replay on memory consolidation and retention in artificial neural networks (ANNs). To achieve this goal, we designed experiments where the network can either remember or forget specific experiences during recall. Our results demonstrate that both strategies have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the task at hand and other environmental factors. Furthermore, our work highlights the critical role of attention mechanisms in regulating the balance between preserving important memories while suppressing irrelevant ones. These findings contribute new insights into how deep learning models process information from their environment and may inform future designs aimed at improving memory performance.",1
"Imitation by observation is an approach for learning from expert demonstrations that lack action information, such as videos. Recent approaches to this problem can be placed into two broad categories: training dynamics models that aim to predict the actions taken between states, and learning rewards or features for computing them for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that learns values, rather than rewards, directly from observations. We show that by using values, we can significantly speed up RL by removing the need to bootstrap action-values, as compared to sparse-reward specifications.",0
"Abstract: Humans tend to place a great deal of importance on perceptions - how we perceive something can greatly affect our attitudes and beliefs towards that thing. In this research project, I aimed to explore whether these perceptions could be objectively measured by analyzing patterns of human behavior in response to certain stimuli. To do so, I designed a study using eye tracking technology to observe participants' gaze patterns as they viewed images depicting various objects. By examining where individuals looked first and for longest periods of time, I was able to determine which aspects of each image were most salient to them - that is, held the most visual value in their eyes. My findings suggest that perceptual values derived through observation may indeed hold some degree of objectivity, as there were clear patterns across all participants' responses that pointed towards particular elements within each picture as being more visually significant than others. These results have important implications for fields such as design, advertising, and psychology, among others. Ultimately, my work highlights the potential utility of incorporating objective measures into our understanding of subjective experiences, which can only serve to enrich our comprehension of human cognition and behavior.

"Reinforcement learning has steadily improved and outperform human in lots of traditional games since the resurgence of deep neural network. However, these success is not easy to be copied to autonomous driving because the state spaces in real world are extreme complex and action spaces are continuous and fine control is required. Moreover, the autonomous driving vehicles must also keep functional safety under the complex environments. To deal with these challenges, we first adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which has the capacity to handle complex state and action spaces in continuous domain. We then choose The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) as our environment to avoid physical damage. Meanwhile, we select a set of appropriate sensor information from TORCS and design our own rewarder. In order to fit DDPG algorithm to TORCS, we design our network architecture for both actor and critic inside DDPG paradigm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, We evaluate on different modes in TORCS and show both quantitative and qualitative results.",0

Overall, these results showcase the potential of deep reinforcement learning for developing intelligent systems able to master highly dynamic and uncertain tasks required by autonomous driving scenarios.",1
"The impact of softmax on the value function itself in reinforcement learning (RL) is often viewed as problematic because it leads to sub-optimal value (or Q) functions and interferes with the contraction properties of the Bellman operator. Surprisingly, despite these concerns, and independent of its effect on exploration, the softmax Bellman operator when combined with Deep Q-learning, leads to Q-functions with superior policies in practice, even outperforming its double Q-learning counterpart. To better understand how and why this occurs, we revisit theoretical properties of the softmax Bellman operator, and prove that $(i)$ it converges to the standard Bellman operator exponentially fast in the inverse temperature parameter, and $(ii)$ the distance of its Q function from the optimal one can be bounded. These alone do not explain its superior performance, so we also show that the softmax operator can reduce the overestimation error, which may give some insight into why a sub-optimal operator leads to better performance in the presence of value function approximation. A comparison among different Bellman operators is then presented, showing the trade-offs when selecting them.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to achieve human-level intelligence. One key component of DRL algorithms is the use of efficient exploration strategies that allow agents to learn faster and more effectively from their experiences. The softmax operator has played an important role in many successful DRL systems due to its ability to normalize probabilities and model uncertainty. However, despite its popularity, there remains room for improvement in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. This paper presents a new perspective on the softmax bellman operator by revisiting its underlying mathematical principles and developing novel techniques for improving its performance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real-world settings. Our work sheds new light on how to design effective exploration strategies in DRL and paves the way for future advancements in artificial intelligence.",1

"Reaching high levels of performance on complex tasks is challenging due to their intrinsic uncertainty. This can lead to catastrophic failures caused by the accumulation of small uncertainties that eventually lead to failure. In order to address these issues, reinforcement learning algorithms have been designed for uncertain environments where the system dynamics may change over time. These methods aim at identifying policies that maximize the expected cumulative reward while taking into account unknown changes in the environment. With the integration of deep neural networks in reinforcement learning models, more advanced representations such as image recognition and autonomous driving systems have become possible. Despite these advances, there remain several open problems that need to be addressed before real world applications become feasible. Furthermore, the use of online adaptation schemes which allow the algorithm to learn new policies during deployment remains a largely unexplored area. Thus, understanding how RL works in uncertain environments remains fundamental for designing adaptive agents able to operate in dynamic settings.",1
"This paper provides a unifying view of a wide range of problems of interest in machine learning by framing them as the minimization of functionals defined on the space of probability measures. In particular, we show that generative adversarial networks, variational inference, and actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning can all be seen through the lens of our framework.

We believe that PDF represents a promising direction for advancing artificial intelligence research and has the potential to revolutionize many fields beyond computer science.",1
"Many continuous control tasks have easily formulated objectives, yet using them directly as a reward in reinforcement learning (RL) leads to suboptimal policies. Therefore, many classical control tasks guide RL training using complex rewards, which require tedious hand-tuning. We automate the reward search with AutoRL, an evolutionary layer over standard RL that treats reward tuning as hyperparameter optimization and trains a population of RL agents to find a reward that maximizes the task objective. AutoRL, evaluated on four Mujoco continuous control tasks over two RL algorithms, shows improvements over baselines, with the the biggest uplift for more complex tasks.

"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) agents to learn from experience through trial and error, without explicit programming. This technique, known as reinforcement learning (RL), allows AI agents to adapt their behavior based on feedback signals called rewards or penalties. However, manually designing reward functions can be difficult, time-consuming, and may lead to suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, researchers have proposed methods that allow reward functions to evolve over time, adapting to changing environments and goals.  The paper presents a study investigating the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize reward functions for RL tasks. Two different approaches were evaluated: firstly, the use of a fitness function to evaluate candidate reward functions and select those that perform well; secondly, coevolution with the policy, where both the policy and reward function parameters are optimized jointly using genetic algorithms. Experiments showed that both methods could effectively automate the process of reward engineering and improve performance compared to hand-engineered reward functions. Additionally, the paper found that coevolution with the policy outperformed independent optimization of each component, highlighting the importance of considering both components simultaneously during search. Overall, the results indicate promise for using evolutionary algorithms to automate the creation of effective reward functions for AI agents performing complex decision making tasks.",1
"We assume that we are given a time series of data from a dynamical system and our task is to learn the flow map of the dynamical system. We present a collection of results on how to enforce constraints coming from the dynamical system in order to accelerate the training of deep neural networks to represent the flow map of the system as well as increase their predictive ability. In particular, we provide ways to enforce constraints during training for all three major modes of learning, namely supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. In general, the dynamic constraints need to include terms which are analogous to memory terms in model reduction formalisms. Such memory terms act as a restoring force which corrects the errors committed by the learned flow map during prediction.   For supervised learning, the constraints are added to the objective function. For the case of unsupervised learning, in particular generative adversarial networks, the constraints are introduced by augmenting the input of the discriminator. Finally, for the case of reinforcement learning and in particular actor-critic methods, the constraints are added to the reward function. In addition, for the reinforcement learning case, we present a novel approach based on homotopy of the action-value function in order to stabilize and accelerate training. We use numerical results for the Lorenz system to illustrate the various constructions.",0
"This paper focuses on enforcing constraints for time series prediction using three different approaches: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Time series data often contains inherent structure, such as periodicity and nonlinearities that can affect predictions. By incorporating prior knowledge through constraints, we aim to improve the accuracy and interpretability of these models while still maintaining their flexibility. We evaluate our methodologies on benchmark datasets and demonstrate their effectiveness by comparing them against other state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of considering constraints in time series prediction tasks, especially in high-stakes applications where accurate forecasting is crucial. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the field of machine learning and providing tools for better decision making in real-world problems involving temporal data.",1
"Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is a meta-learning technique to train a model on a multitude of learning tasks in a way that primes the model for few-shot learning of new tasks. The MAML algorithm performs well on few-shot learning problems in classification, regression, and fine-tuning of policy gradients in reinforcement learning, but comes with the need for costly hyperparameter tuning for training stability. We address this shortcoming by introducing an extension to MAML, called Alpha MAML, to incorporate an online hyperparameter adaptation scheme that eliminates the need to tune meta-learning and learning rates. Our results with the Omniglot database demonstrate a substantial reduction in the need to tune MAML training hyperparameters and improvement to training stability with less sensitivity to hyperparameter choice.",0
"Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful technique that allows models to learn from multiple tasks or experiences, improving their ability to generalize to new situations. One popular approach to meta-learning is model agnostic meta-learning (MAML), which learns initial parameters that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by taking only a few steps of gradient descent on task-specific data. However, current methods may require significant computational resources or are sensitive to hyperparameters. In this paper, we introduce alpha maml, a method that addresses these challenges by combining simplicity and efficiency through a two-step adaptation process. Our framework first estimates a shared task metric using a lightweight neural network, then updates the model’s parameters accordingly. We showcase the performance of our method across diverse environments including image classification, reinforcement learning, program synthesis, and question answering. Alpha MAML achieves state-of-the-art results while requiring fewer shots, less time for fine-tuning, and smaller model sizes compared to baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, highlighting its potential to improve meta-learning techniques, paving the way towards more efficient artificial intelligence systems.",1
"As global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the use of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), a form of solar geoengineering, is increasingly considered in order to artificially mitigate climate change effects. However, initial research in simulation suggests that naive SAI can have catastrophic regional consequences, which may induce serious geostrategic conflicts. Current geo-engineering research treats SAI control in low-dimensional approximation only. We suggest treating SAI as a high-dimensional control problem, with policies trained according to a context-sensitive reward function within the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm. In order to facilitate training in simulation, we suggest to emulate HadCM3, a widely used General Circulation Model, using deep learning techniques. We believe this is the first application of DRL to the climate sciences.",0
"As countries continue to grapple with the reality of climate change, policymakers and researchers alike have explored various mitigation strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the rapid pace of global warming demands immediate action that can slow down the temperature rise before permanent damage occurs. One such strategy gaining traction is stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which involves releasing sulfur dioxide particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth and cool the planet. Despite promising results, concerns remain regarding SAI's potential impact on atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem health. This study approaches SAI as a deep reinforcement learning problem by modeling interactions between human decisions, environmental dynamics, and societal outcomes. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, we simulate different scenarios involving varying levels of intervention intensity and duration and evaluate their effectiveness in achieving desired temperature thresholds while minimizing negative side effects. Our findings support the feasibility of SAI as a short-term emergency measure under carefully controlled conditions and highlight the need for further experimentation and multidisciplinary collaboration towards addressing climate change challenges. With proper governance structures in place, SAI could serve as a bridging solution until longer term sustainable solutions take hold.",1
"Off-policy reinforcement learning with eligibility traces is challenging because of the discrepancy between target policy and behavior policy. One common approach is to measure the difference between two policies in a probabilistic way, such as importance sampling and tree-backup. However, existing off-policy learning methods based on probabilistic policy measurement are inefficient when utilizing traces under a greedy target policy, which is ineffective for control problems. The traces are cut immediately when a non-greedy action is taken, which may lose the advantage of eligibility traces and slow down the learning process. Alternatively, some non-probabilistic measurement methods such as General Q($\lambda$) and Naive Q($\lambda$) never cut traces, but face convergence problems in practice. To address the above issues, this paper introduces a new method named TBQ($\sigma$), which effectively unifies the tree-backup algorithm and Naive Q($\lambda$). By introducing a new parameter $\sigma$ to illustrate the \emph{degree} of utilizing traces, TBQ($\sigma$) creates an effective integration of TB($\lambda$) and Naive Q($\lambda$) and continuous role shift between them. The contraction property of TB($\sigma$) is theoretically analyzed for both policy evaluation and control settings. We also derive the online version of TBQ($\sigma$) and give the convergence proof. We empirically show that, for $\epsilon\in(0,1]$ in $\epsilon$-greedy policies, there exists some degree of utilizing traces for $\lambda\in[0,1]$, which can improve the efficiency in trace utilization for off-policy reinforcement learning, to both accelerate the learning process and improve the performance.",0

"Shaping in humans and animals has been shown to be a powerful tool for learning complex tasks as compared to learning in a randomized fashion. This makes the problem less complex and enables one to solve the easier sub task at hand first. Generating a curriculum for such guided learning involves subjecting the agent to easier goals first, and then gradually increasing their difficulty. This paper takes a similar direction and proposes a dual curriculum scheme for solving robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards, called MaMiC. It includes a macro curriculum scheme which divides the task into multiple sub-tasks followed by a micro curriculum scheme which enables the agent to learn between such discovered sub-tasks. We show how combining macro and micro curriculum strategies help in overcoming major exploratory constraints considered in robot manipulation tasks without having to engineer any complex rewards. We also illustrate the meaning of the individual curricula and how they can be used independently based on the task. The performance of such a dual curriculum scheme is analyzed on the Fetch environments.",0
"In this paper we propose two different approaches to curriculum learning for robotic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. One approach is inspired by macroeconomics principles and defines goals for the RL agent at different levels of abstraction, such as state exploration, skill development, task execution and adaptive behavior change. This allows us to address problems caused by the curse of dimensionality that plagues most continuous action spaces. The second approach focuses on microeconomic principles such as competition and profit maximization. We use hierarchical deep Q-networks to create subgoals which can then be learned using standard RL methods. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline algorithms across several domains, including gridworld tasks, simulated robot manipulation and real world robots playing sports games.",1
"Recent work in reinforcement learning demonstrated that learning solely through self-play is not only possible, but could also result in novel strategies that humans never would have thought of. However, optimization methods cast as a game between two players require careful tuning to prevent suboptimal results. Hence, we look at random play as an alternative method. In this paper, we train a DQN agent to play Sungka, a two-player turn-based board game wherein the players compete to obtain more stones than the other. We show that even with purely random play, our training algorithm converges very fast and is stable. Moreover, we test our trained agent against several baselines and show its ability to consistently win against these.",0
"This paper presents research into how players can improve their strategy during games of sungka without any prior knowledge. It uses data collected from participants playing multiple rounds of sungka, analyses player decisions and discusses strategies that increase win probability. The results demonstrate the possibility of achieving high winning rates through experimentation rather than relying on expertise alone. Implications and future directions for further improving performance in sungka games are also discussed.",1
"Automated design of neural network architectures tailored for a specific task is an extremely promising, albeit inherently difficult, avenue to explore. While most results in this domain have been achieved on image classification and language modelling problems, here we concentrate on dense per-pixel tasks, in particular, semantic image segmentation using fully convolutional networks. In contrast to the aforementioned areas, the design choices of a fully convolutional network require several changes, ranging from the sort of operations that need to be used---e.g., dilated convolutions---to a solving of a more difficult optimisation problem. In this work, we are particularly interested in searching for high-performance compact segmentation architectures, able to run in real-time using limited resources. To achieve that, we intentionally over-parameterise the architecture during the training time via a set of auxiliary cells that provide an intermediate supervisory signal and can be omitted during the evaluation phase. The design of the auxiliary cell is emitted by a controller, a neural network with the fixed structure trained using reinforcement learning. More crucially, we demonstrate how to efficiently search for these architectures within limited time and computational budgets. In particular, we rely on a progressive strategy that terminates non-promising architectures from being further trained, and on Polyak averaging coupled with knowledge distillation to speed-up the convergence. Quantitatively, in 8 GPU-days our approach discovers a set of architectures performing on-par with state-of-the-art among compact models on the semantic segmentation, pose estimation and depth prediction tasks.

"We consider a model-based approach to perform batch off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. Our method takes a mixture-of-experts approach to combine parametric and non-parametric models of the environment such that the final value estimate has the least expected error. We do so by first estimating the local accuracy of each model and then using a planner to select which model to use at every time step as to minimize the return error estimate along entire trajectories. Across a variety of domains, our mixture-based approach outperforms the individual models alone as well as state-of-the-art importance sampling-based estimators.",0
"In off-policy evaluation, evaluating policies that differ from the policy that generated data requires correcting for distribution shift. Both parametric models and nonparametric models have been used for this purpose, but using either alone can be limited by model misspecification or insufficient flexibility. This paper proposes combining both types of models, leveraging their respective strengths while mitigating weaknesses. The proposed method uses a flexible nonparametric model to capture complex relationship between features and outcomes and a parametric model to provide regularization and improve identifiability. We show how to combine these models effectively through efficient inference algorithms that scale to large datasets. Experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods.",1
"The combination of deep neural network models and reinforcement learning algorithms can make it possible to learn policies for robotic behaviors that directly read in raw sensory inputs, such as camera images, effectively subsuming both estimation and control into one model. However, real-world applications of reinforcement learning must specify the goal of the task by means of a manually programmed reward function, which in practice requires either designing the very same perception pipeline that end-to-end reinforcement learning promises to avoid, or else instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to determine if the task has been performed successfully. In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for manual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from a modest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively solicited queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label to determine whether that state represents successful completion of the task. While requesting labels for every single state would amount to asking the user to manually provide the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a tiny fraction of the states seen during training, making it an efficient and practical approach for learning skills without manually engineered rewards. We evaluate our method on real-world robotic manipulation tasks where the observations consist of images viewed by the robot's camera. In our experiments, our method effectively learns to arrange objects, place books, and drape cloth, directly from images and without any manually specified reward functions, and with only 1-4 hours of interaction with the real world.",0

Our results showcase the potential of end-to-end deep reinforcement learning algorithms for enabling robots to autonomously acquire new skills, adapt to novel situations, and interact with their surroundings.

"We consider an agent who is involved in a Markov decision process and receives a vector of outcomes every round. Her objective is to maximize a global concave reward function on the average vectorial outcome. The problem models applications such as multi-objective optimization, maximum entropy exploration, and constrained optimization in Markovian environments. In our general setting where a stationary policy could have multiple recurrent classes, the agent faces a subtle yet consequential trade-off in alternating among different actions for balancing the vectorial outcomes. In particular, stationary policies are in general sub-optimal. We propose a no-regret algorithm based on online convex optimization (OCO) tools (Agrawal and Devanur 2014) and UCRL2 (Jaksch et al. 2010). Importantly, we introduce a novel gradient threshold procedure, which carefully controls the switches among actions to handle the subtle trade-off. By delaying the gradient updates, our procedure produces a non-stationary policy that diversifies the outcomes for optimizing the objective. The procedure is compatible with a variety of OCO tools.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), the exploration-exploitation trade-off refers to the dilemma faced by agents who must balance the need to explore new actions to learn more about their environment versus exploiting existing knowledge to maximize rewards. This challenge becomes particularly acute in online Markov decision processes (OMDPs) where both the state transition probabilities and reward functions can change over time.  This paper presents a novel approach to addressing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in OMDPs with global concave rewards. We begin by introducing a new algorithm called Tractable Thompson Sampling (TTS) that builds upon Thompson sampling but incorporates additional techniques to improve its performance in OMDPs. Our main contribution lies in developing a tight bound on the regret of TTS using Lyapunov drift theory. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of Lyapunov drift analysis to online MDPs with nonlinear function approximation.  We demonstrate the efficacy of TTS through extensive simulations across several domains, including stochastic and adversarial environments. Results show that TTS outperforms existing methods while requiring fewer samples for optimal exploration. Moreover, we present a theoretical justification for why the proposed method succeeds even when traditional methods fail due to the use of global concave rewards.  In summary, this paper proposes a novel framework for tackling the exploration-exploitation trade-off in OMDPs with global concave rewards. By leveraging recent advancements in Lyapunov drift analysis and integrating them into Thompson sampling, we develop an efficient algorithm that significantly improves upon current approaches. Our findings have important implications for designing intelligent agents capable of adapting to changing and uncertain environments.",1
"We establish geometric and topological properties of the space of value functions in finite state-action Markov decision processes.

Finally, we use this novel perspective to introduce visualizations to enhance the understanding of the dynamics of reinforcement learning algorithms.",0

We begin by introducing the concept and formalizing the mathematical foundations of the value function polytope. We then discuss several key advantages of using this representation, including improved sample efficiency and reduced solution fragility. Next, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the value function polytope across a range of benchmark problems from the RL literature. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of potential future directions for research in this area.",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning based methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization, or Q-learning typically require thousands of interactions with the environment to approximate the optimum controller which may not always be feasible in robotics due to safety and time consumption. Model-based methods such as PILCO or BlackDrops, while data-efficient, provide solutions with limited robustness and complexity. To address this tradeoff, we introduce active uncertainty reduction-based virtual environments, which are formed through limited trials conducted in the original environment. We provide an efficient method for uncertainty management, which is used as a metric for self-improvement by identification of the points with maximum expected improvement through adaptive sampling. Capturing the uncertainty also allows for better mimicking of the reward responses of the original system. Our approach enables the use of complex policy structures and reward functions through a unique combination of model-based and model-free methods, while still retaining the data efficiency. We demonstrate the validity of our method on several classic reinforcement learning problems in OpenAI gym. We prove that our approach offers a better modeling capacity for complex system dynamics as compared to established methods.",0
"This will make up the body of the abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an efficient paradigm for robot control that can reduce uncertainty during task execution, but has difficulty dealing with initially large uncertainties due to insufficient exploration. To solve such challenges, we propose active RL methods that use preplanned trajectories from initial states to iteratively remove uncertainty and reduce search spaces. We evaluate our algorithm’s efficiency using four tasks on two robotic systems. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies, reducing average path lengths by over sixty percent in some cases while significantly improving overall performance. Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning for Robotics and Control with Active Uncertainty Reduction ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Abstract: In the realm of robotics and control, reinforcement learning (RL) presents itself as an attractive option due to its ability to efficiently provide solutions to complex problems. Despite its potential advantages, traditional RL approaches struggle with significant uncertainties present at the beginning stages of problem solving. This challenge arises from the fact that the agent often lacks sufficient knowledge and must explore different options before finding effective solutions. In light of these limitations, researchers have introduced active RL methods designed to mitigate ambiguity through preplanned trajectory assistance. The proposed approach utilizes preprogrammed paths derived from initial conditions to gradually eliminate uncertainty. By narrowing down search areas and providing guidance early in the learning process, agents equipped with these techniques experience more focused and effective search strategies compared to their passive counterparts. In this work, we introduce four case studies involving two separate robots, testing both simulation and experimental scenarios. Across all tests, our methodology consistently produced remarkable results in terms of path length reduction—up to 60%—and substantially improved overall performance scores. These findings underscore the significance of incorporating adaptive active learning frameworks into future developments in robotics and control applications. (word count: 294).",1
"A long-standing challenge in Reinforcement Learning is enabling agents to learn a model of their environment which can be transferred to solve other problems in a world with the same underlying rules. One reason this is difficult is the challenge of learning accurate models of an environment. If such a model is inaccurate, the agent's plans and actions will likely be sub-optimal, and likely lead to the wrong outcomes. Recent progress in model-based reinforcement learning has improved the ability for agents to learn and use predictive models. In this paper, we extend a recent deep learning architecture which learns a predictive model of the environment that aims to predict only the value of a few key measurements, which are be indicative of an agent's performance. Predicting only a few measurements rather than the entire future state of an environment makes it more feasible to learn a valuable predictive model. We extend this predictive model with a small, evolving neural network that suggests the best goals to pursue in the current state. We demonstrate that this allows the predictive model to transfer to new scenarios where goals are different, and that the adaptive goals can even adjust agent behavior on-line, changing its strategy to fit the current context.",0
"One of the key challenges faced by machine learning algorithms is their lack of adaptability, particularly when it comes to transferring learned knowledge from one task to another. In order to address this issue, researchers have proposed the use of self-adapting goals (SAG) as a means of allowing predictive models to more easily transfer learned knowledge to new tasks. This approach involves training machine learning algorithms on both static and dynamic objectives that can change over time. By doing so, these algorithms are able to better learn underlying patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns rather than simply memorizing specific examples. As such, SAG allows models to generalize better across different domains and tasks, making them more effective at transfer learning. This paper presents an analysis of how SAG works and evaluates its performance through experiments using real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that SAG significantly outperforms traditional methods for transfer learning, highlighting its potential utility for a wide range of applications. Overall, SAG provides a promising solution for improving the adaptability and effectiveness of machine learning models.",1
"Recently, the state-of-the-art models for image captioning have overtaken human performance based on the most popular metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr. Does this mean we have solved the task of image captioning? The above metrics only measure the similarity of the generated caption to the human annotations, which reflects its accuracy. However, an image contains many concepts and multiple levels of detail, and thus there is a variety of captions that express different concepts and details that might be interesting for different humans. Therefore only evaluating accuracy is not sufficient for measuring the performance of captioning models --- the diversity of the generated captions should also be considered. In this paper, we proposed a new metric for measuring the diversity of image captions, which is derived from latent semantic analysis and kernelized to use CIDEr similarity. We conduct extensive experiments to re-evaluate recent captioning models in the context of both diversity and accuracy. We find that there is still a large gap between the model and human performance in terms of both accuracy and diversity and the models that have optimized accuracy (CIDEr) have low diversity. We also show that balancing the cross-entropy loss and CIDEr reward in reinforcement learning during training can effectively control the tradeoff between diversity and accuracy of the generated captions.",0
"Image caption generation has been gaining attention recently as a challenging task that requires machine learning models to generate descriptive natural language captions of images, similarly to how humans would describe them. However, most current approaches lack the ability to incorporate human traits such as individuality, creativity, and subjectivity into their descriptions, leading to uniform and impersonal captions. This research focuses on addressing these limitations by developing novel techniques that allow machines to better mimic human-like description patterns while preserving relevant details from the input images. We propose an algorithm based on adversarial training that forces the model to generate captions that can fool human evaluators into thinking they were written by a person. Our results demonstrate significant improvement compared to baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics including coherence, accuracy, diversity, and adequacy. Additionally, we perform detailed analysis showing that our method leads to more diverse and personalized descriptions closer to human preferences. Overall, this work bridges the gap between objective understanding and subjective interpretation in artificial intelligence, providing promising insights for future advancements in image caption generation and beyond.",1
"In an episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, an online algorithm chooses from a set of actions in a sequence of $H$ trials, where $H$ is the episode length, in order to maximize the total payoff of the chosen actions. Q-learning, as the most popular model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, directly parameterizes and updates value functions without explicitly modeling the environment. Recently, [Jin et al. 2018] studies the sample complexity of Q-learning with finite states and actions. Their algorithm achieves nearly optimal regret, which shows that Q-learning can be made sample efficient. However, MDPs with large discrete states and actions [Silver et al. 2016] or continuous spaces [Mnih et al. 2013] cannot learn efficiently in this way. Hence, it is critical to develop new algorithms to solve this dilemma with provable guarantee on the sample complexity. With this motivation, we propose a novel algorithm that works for MDPs with a more general setting, which has infinitely many states and actions and assumes that the payoff function and transition kernel are Lipschitz continuous. We also provide corresponding theory justification for our algorithm. It achieves the regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{\frac{d+1}{d+2}}\sqrt{H^3}),$ where $K$ denotes the number of episodes and $d$ denotes the dimension of the joint space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the model-free setting whose established regret matches the lower bound up to a logarithmic factor.",0

We empirically show how this formulation improves performance by simultaneously optimizing the evaluation metric and smoothing the loss landscape. We verify our method in metric learning and classification scenarios, showing considerable improvements over the state-of-the-art on a diverse set of tasks. Importantly, our method is applicable to a wide range of loss functions and evaluation metrics.

"Most model-free reinforcement learning methods leverage state representations (embeddings) for generalization, but either ignore structure in the space of actions or assume the structure is provided a priori. We show how a policy can be decomposed into a component that acts in a low-dimensional space of action representations and a component that transforms these representations into actual actions. These representations improve generalization over large, finite action sets by allowing the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar to actions already taken. We provide an algorithm to both learn and use action representations and provide conditions for its convergence.

"The options framework in reinforcement learning models the notion of a skill or a temporally extended sequence of actions. The discovery of a reusable set of skills has typically entailed building options, that navigate to bottleneck states. This work adopts a complementary approach, where we attempt to discover options that navigate to landmark states. These states are prototypical representatives of well-connected regions and can hence access the associated region with relative ease. In this work, we propose Successor Options, which leverages Successor Representations to build a model of the state space. The intra-option policies are learnt using a novel pseudo-reward and the model scales to high-dimensional spaces easily. Additionally, we also propose an Incremental Successor Options model that iterates between constructing Successor Representations and building options, which is useful when robust Successor Representations cannot be built solely from primitive actions.

"Policy gradient methods are powerful reinforcement learning algorithms and have been demonstrated to solve many complex tasks. However, these methods are also data-inefficient, afflicted with high variance gradient estimates, and frequently get stuck in local optima.

The resulting objective is amenable to standard neural network optimization strategies like stochastic gradient descent or stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Incorporation of previous rollouts via importance sampling greatly improves data-efficiency, whilst stochastic optimization schemes facilitate the escape from local optima.

We introduce two variants: one directly optimizing expected total reward during the rollout and another following a truncation scheme. These allow us to control exploration without sacrificing convergence speed compared to traditional trust-region methods. We demonstrate our approach’s performance by comparing it against several state-of-the-art baselines on popular benchmarks including Humanoid, Hopper, Walker2D, HalfCheetah and Ant. Overall our results show a clear improvement over current state-of-the art in both sample efficiency and final performance.",1
"In this paper, we propose TauRieL and target Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) since it has broad applicability in theoretical and applied sciences. TauRieL utilizes an actor-critic inspired architecture that adopts ordinary feedforward nets to obtain a policy update vector $v$. Then, we use $v$ to improve the state transition matrix from which we generate the policy. Also, the state transition matrix allows the solver to initialize from precomputed solutions such as nearest neighbors. In an online learning setting, TauRieL unifies the training and the search where it can generate near-optimal results in seconds. The input to the neural nets in the actor-critic architecture are raw 2-D inputs, and the design idea behind this decision is to keep neural nets relatively smaller than the architectures with wide embeddings with the tradeoff of omitting any distributed representations of the embeddings. Consequently, TauRieL generates TSP solutions two orders of magnitude faster per TSP instance as compared to state-of-the-art offline techniques with a performance impact of 6.1\% in the worst case.",0
"""Targeting Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Deep Reinforcement Learning Inspired Architecture"" presents an innovative approach to solving one of the most challenging problems in computer science: finding optimal solutions for complex combinatorial optimization tasks such as TSP. This study proposes a novel algorithm called TauRieL that combines state-of-the-art techniques from deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and classical optimization methods.  The main contribution of our work lies in designing an efficient DRL agent that effectively learns the policy gradient using targeted maximum likelihood estimation, which has been previously applied successfully to other domains such as speech recognition and games. Our agent explores the problem space by generating samples from its policy distribution instead of using expensive Monte Carlo rollouts, allowing us to significantly speed up training times without sacrificing solution quality.  We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets ranging from small to large sizes, comparing the performance against well-established baselines like Concorde and Random Sampling Hill Climber. Results show that TauRieL consistently outperforms these algorithms across all instances, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding high-quality solutions efficiently. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analysis of the key components driving the success of our algorithm, enabling insights into the behavior of the agent during search.  Overall, our research offers significant advances in solving TSP through novel integration of machine learning paradigms and search heuristics. Given the ubiquity of combinatorial optimization problems, our findings have far-reaching implications for tackling real-world applications requiring efficient decision making under uncertainty, including logistics, transportation planning, and manufacturing.",1
"We explore value-based solutions for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks in the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) regime popularized recently. However, VDN and QMIX are representative examples that use the idea of factorization of the joint action-value function into individual ones for decentralized execution. VDN and QMIX address only a fraction of factorizable MARL tasks due to their structural constraint in factorization such as additivity and monotonicity. In this paper, we propose a new factorization method for MARL, QTRAN, which is free from such structural constraints and takes on a new approach to transforming the original joint action-value function into an easily factorizable one, with the same optimal actions. QTRAN guarantees more general factorization than VDN or QMIX, thus covering a much wider class of MARL tasks than does previous methods. Our experiments for the tasks of multi-domain Gaussian-squeeze and modified predator-prey demonstrate QTRAN's superior performance with especially larger margins in games whose payoffs penalize non-cooperative behavior more aggressively.",0
"In recent years, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has gained significant attention as a promising approach for solving complex problems that involve multiple agents interacting with each other in uncertain environments. However, designing efficient MARL algorithms remains challenging due to issues such as nonstationarity, partial observability, and credit assignment. In this work, we introduce QTRAN, a novel algorithm that addresses these limitations by combining transformation techniques with factorized value functions. Our method enables effective cooperation among agents while ensuring scalability to large-scale systems. Extensive experimental evaluation across various domains demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. This study contributes to the development of advanced MARL algorithms with strong theoretical foundations and practical applications.",1
"Dealing with high variance is a significant challenge in model-free reinforcement learning (RL). Existing methods are unreliable, exhibiting high variance in performance from run to run using different initializations/seeds. Focusing on problems arising in continuous control, we propose a functional regularization approach to augmenting model-free RL. In particular, we regularize the behavior of the deep policy to be similar to a policy prior, i.e., we regularize in function space. We show that functional regularization yields a bias-variance trade-off, and propose an adaptive tuning strategy to optimize this trade-off. When the policy prior has control-theoretic stability guarantees, we further show that this regularization approximately preserves those stability guarantees throughout learning. We validate our approach empirically on a range of settings, and demonstrate significantly reduced variance, guaranteed dynamic stability, and more efficient learning than deep RL alone.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), controlling the exploration process can greatly impact model performance. For effective RL control, regularization techniques have been introduced. However, existing approaches are limited in their ability to reduce variance during training, which often leads to suboptimal results. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called control regularization that improves the stability and reduced variance of model outputs under various conditions. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms current methods on multiple RL benchmarks. By applying novel data structures to learn and represent policies, our framework captures meaningful behavioral characteristics that lead to better generalization across domains. Our experiments show that control regularization effectively controls the policy evaluation phase while minimizing policy updates. These findings offer valuable insights into efficient RL control mechanisms that improve performance on complex tasks. Overall, our contributions advance the state-of-the-art in reducing variance and increasing stability in modern RL algorithms, paving the way for more robust applications in real-world settings.",1
"Simulation is a useful tool in situations where training data for machine learning models is costly to annotate or even hard to acquire. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method for automatically adjusting the parameters of any (non-differentiable) simulator, thereby controlling the distribution of synthesized data in order to maximize the accuracy of a model trained on that data. In contrast to prior art that hand-crafts these simulation parameters or adjusts only parts of the available parameters, our approach fully controls the simulator with the actual underlying goal of maximizing accuracy, rather than mimicking the real data distribution or randomly generating a large volume of data. We find that our approach (i) quickly converges to the optimal simulation parameters in controlled experiments and (ii) can indeed discover good sets of parameters for an image rendering simulator in actual computer vision applications.",0
"This article proposes that the use of simulation technology has increased significantly over the past decade due to advancements in computer graphics, virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).

"In distributional reinforcement learning (RL), the estimated distribution of value function models both the parametric and intrinsic uncertainties. We propose a novel and efficient exploration method for deep RL that has two components. The first is a decaying schedule to suppress the intrinsic uncertainty. The second is an exploration bonus calculated from the upper quantiles of the learned distribution. In Atari 2600 games, our method outperforms QR-DQN in 12 out of 14 hard games (achieving 483 \% average gain across 49 games in cumulative rewards over QR-DQN with a big win in Venture). We also compared our algorithm with QR-DQN in a challenging 3D driving simulator (CARLA). Results show that our algorithm achieves near-optimal safety rewards twice faster than QRDQN.",0
"This study presents a new model for deep reinforcement learning called Distributional Value Iteration (DVI). Unlike traditional value iteration methods that approximate expected accumulated rewards at each state as a single scalar, DVI approximates expected future accumulated returns across multiple runs as probability distributions. By computing these expectations on a lower dimensional distribution over rewards rather than individual sample values, DVI significantly reduces computational cost compared to other exploration strategies while still allowing for efficient policy improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DVI through extensive experiments and comparisons against previous exploration methods both in terms of sample efficiency and final performance, showing significant improvements over existing methods. Additionally, we apply our method to continuous control domains and complex multi-task environments where it achieves substantial gains in stability and overall task proficiency over prior work. Our results show that DVI provides a compelling solution to efficient exploration in a variety of settings, further enabling more scalable reinforcement learning systems in real world applications.",1
"Many real-world decision problems are characterized by multiple conflicting objectives which must be balanced based on their relative importance. In the dynamic weights setting the relative importance changes over time and specialized algorithms that deal with such change, such as a tabular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm by Natarajan and Tadepalli (2005), are required. However, this earlier work is not feasible for RL settings that necessitate the use of function approximators. We generalize across weight changes and high-dimensional inputs by proposing a multi-objective Q-network whose outputs are conditioned on the relative importance of objectives and we introduce Diverse Experience Replay (DER) to counter the inherent non-stationarity of the Dynamic Weights setting. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and compare our methods to adapted algorithms from Deep Multi-Task/Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning and show that our proposed network in combination with DER dominates these adapted algorithms across weight change scenarios and problem domains.",0
"In multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (MORL), multiple objectives need to be simultaneously optimized by selecting appropriate actions based on trade-offs among them. Conventional MORL methods optimize objectives using predefined weight factors that give different importance levels to each objective; however, these weights may change over time due to changes in task requirements or system dynamics. As such, adapting weights dynamically during runtime can improve the performance of the overall optimization process. This study proposes dynamic weight adaptation in MORL tasks, aimed at updating weight values online according to changing environmental conditions. Experiments show improved results in solving challenging benchmark problems and real-world applications. Results suggest the effectiveness of proposed approaches compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",1
"Physical construction---the ability to compose objects, subject to physical dynamics, to serve some function---is fundamental to human intelligence. We introduce a suite of challenging physical construction tasks inspired by how children play with blocks, such as matching a target configuration, stacking blocks to connect objects together, and creating shelter-like structures over target objects. We examine how a range of deep reinforcement learning agents fare on these challenges, and introduce several new approaches which provide superior performance. Our results show that agents which use structured representations (e.g., objects and scene graphs) and structured policies (e.g., object-centric actions) outperform those which use less structured representations, and generalize better beyond their training when asked to reason about larger scenes. Model-based agents which use Monte-Carlo Tree Search also outperform strictly model-free agents in our most challenging construction problems. We conclude that approaches which combine structured representations and reasoning with powerful learning are a key path toward agents that possess rich intuitive physics, scene understanding, and planning.",0

Our results show that we can significantly improve upon existing state-of-the-art methods for robotic assembly tasks while enabling robots to work effectively with everyday tools and materials. Finally, we discuss future research directions and potential applications of our framework.",1
"The Exploration-Exploitation tradeoff arises in Reinforcement Learning when one cannot tell if a policy is optimal. Then, there is a constant need to explore new actions instead of exploiting past experience. In practice, it is common to resolve the tradeoff by using a fixed exploration mechanism, such as $\epsilon$-greedy exploration or by adding Gaussian noise, while still trying to learn an optimal policy. In this work, we take a different approach and study exploration-conscious criteria, that result in optimal policies with respect to the exploration mechanism. Solving these criteria, as we establish, amounts to solving a surrogate Markov Decision Process. We continue and analyze properties of exploration-conscious optimal policies and characterize two general approaches to solve such criteria. Building on the approaches, we apply simple changes in existing tabular and deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms and empirically demonstrate superior performance relatively to their non-exploration-conscious counterparts, both for discrete and continuous action spaces.",0
"In recent years, exploration has become increasingly important as a means of enabling reinforcement learning algorithms to learn more efficiently from sparse rewards and explore parts of the state space that may lead to better solutions. At the same time, consciousness continues to play a major role in shaping our understanding of cognition and behavior, but its exact relationship to machine learning remains unclear. This paper seeks to contribute to these two areas by proposing a new model for integrating exploration into conscious reinforcement learning, which we call ""conscious exploratory Q-learning"" (CEQL). Our approach draws on both theoretical work in psychology and neuroscience, as well as experimental data collected through simulated environments, to demonstrate how CEQL can improve performance over traditional methods while remaining grounded in principles of conscious awareness. We find that CEQL outperforms non-exploratory baselines across a range of tasks and is able to learn faster and more accurately than unconscious models even when they incorporate intrinsic motivation. These results have implications for the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of high-level reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, suggesting that future research should focus on refining our understanding of consciousness within the context of RL. By bridging the gap between human-like intuitions and algorithmic methodologies, we aim to create intelligent agents that truly think like humans.",1
"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) exploits temporally extended actions, or options, to make decisions from a higher-dimensional perspective to alleviate the sparse reward problem, one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning. The majority of existing HRL algorithms require either significant manual design with respect to the specific environment or enormous exploration to automatically learn options from data. To achieve fast exploration without using manual design, we devise a multi-goal HRL algorithm, consisting of a high-level policy Manager and a low-level policy Worker. The Manager provides the Worker multiple subgoals at each time step. Each subgoal corresponds to an option to control the environment. Although the agent may show some confusion at the beginning of training since it is guided by three diverse subgoals, the agent's behavior policy will quickly learn how to respond to multiple subgoals from the high-level controller on different occasions. By exploiting multiple subgoals, the exploration efficiency is significantly improved. We conduct experiments in Atari's Montezuma's Revenge environment, a well-known sparse reward environment, and in doing so achieve the same performance as state-of-the-art HRL methods with substantially reduced training time cost.",0
"In recent years there has been growing interest in hierarchical reinforcement learning, which seeks to decompose complex tasks into smaller subtasks that can be learned more efficiently. One approach to hierarchical RL is multi-objective learning, where multiple subgoals are used as intermediate rewards during training. This paper presents a new method called LEXORS (LEarning and EXPLOiting MulTiple SUBgoals) which combines several state-of-the-art techniques from both hierarchical and single-task deep RL. Our method learns multiple interleaved subgoals at once while achieving better sample efficiency and task performance compared to previous methods. We demonstrate our results on two challenging continuous control benchmarks: Sacher et al. (2018)'s Ant and Hopper continuation task suite and Pommier et al.'s (2019)'s MuJoCo locomotion task set. Overall, we believe that LEXORS represents a significant step forward in terms of understanding how to effectively combine several desirable properties (sample efficiency, exploration exploitation tradeoff, generalization across tasks and domains) in one framework.",1
"Increasingly available city data and advanced learning techniques have empowered people to improve the efficiency of our city functions. Among them, improving the urban transportation efficiency is one of the most prominent topics. Recent studies have proposed to use reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control. Different from traditional transportation approaches which rely heavily on prior knowledge, RL can learn directly from the feedback. On the other side, without a careful model design, existing RL methods typically take a long time to converge and the learned models may not be able to adapt to new scenarios. For example, a model that is trained well for morning traffic may not work for the afternoon traffic because the traffic flow could be reversed, resulting in a very different state representation. In this paper, we propose a novel design called FRAP, which is based on the intuitive principle of phase competition in traffic signal control: when two traffic signals conflict, priority should be given to one with larger traffic movement (i.e., higher demand). Through the phase competition modeling, our model achieves invariance to symmetrical cases such as flipping and rotation in traffic flow. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model finds better solutions than existing RL methods in the complicated all-phase selection problem, converges much faster during training, and achieves superior generalizability for different road structures and traffic conditions.",0
"""This research explores the use of learning phase competition for traffic signal control. Traditional approaches to traffic signal timing have relied on fixed cycle lengths and predefined split ratios, which can lead to suboptimal performance and increased congestion. By using real-time data collection and machine learning techniques, we propose a novel approach that adapts the duration of each light phase based on current traffic conditions. This system dynamically adjusts the length of green, yellow, and red phases during each cycle to improve throughput and reduce delay at intersections. We evaluate our algorithm using simulation experiments and demonstrate that learning phase competition significantly reduces average queue length and waiting time while maintaining safety standards. Our results show promise for improving urban mobility and reducing congestion.""",1
"With the increasing availability of traffic data and advance of deep reinforcement learning techniques, there is an emerging trend of employing reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control. A key question for applying RL to traffic signal control is how to define the reward and state. The ultimate objective in traffic signal control is to minimize the travel time, which is difficult to reach directly. Hence, existing studies often define reward as an ad-hoc weighted linear combination of several traffic measures. However, there is no guarantee that the travel time will be optimized with the reward. In addition, recent RL approaches use more complicated state (e.g., image) in order to describe the full traffic situation. However, none of the existing studies has discussed whether such a complex state representation is necessary. This extra complexity may lead to significantly slower learning process but may not necessarily bring significant performance gain.   In this paper, we propose to re-examine the RL approaches through the lens of classic transportation theory. We ask the following questions: (1) How should we design the reward so that one can guarantee to minimize the travel time? (2) How to design a state representation which is concise yet sufficient to obtain the optimal solution? Our proposed method LIT is theoretically supported by the classic traffic signal control methods in transportation field. LIT has a very simple state and reward design, thus can serve as a building block for future RL approaches to traffic signal control. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods.",0

"Assemblies of modular subsystems are being pressed into service to perform sensing, reasoning, and decision making in high-stakes, time-critical tasks in such areas as transportation, healthcare, and industrial automation. We address the opportunity to maximize the utility of an overall computing system by employing reinforcement learning to guide the configuration of the set of interacting modules that comprise the system. The challenge of doing system-wide optimization is a combinatorial problem. Local attempts to boost the performance of a specific module by modifying its configuration often leads to losses in overall utility of the system's performance as the distribution of inputs to downstream modules changes drastically. We present metareasoning techniques which consider a rich representation of the input, monitor the state of the entire pipeline, and adjust the configuration of modules on-the-fly so as to maximize the utility of a system's operation. We show significant improvement in both real-world and synthetic pipelines across a variety of reinforcement learning techniques.",0
"In modern software engineering practice, modularity has emerged as a central principle driving design decisions across domains. This allows developers to create flexible systems that can accommodate changing requirements over time, facilitating maintenance and evolution. However, as these systems grow more complex, managing their configuration becomes increasingly difficult due to intricate interdependencies among components. As such, techniques that support on-the-fly reconfiguration based on rich contextual representations could greatly benefit system maintainability and adaptability. Here we present a new approach called metareasoning in modular software systems (MSS), which leverages machine learning (ML) methods specifically designed to handle high-dimensional state spaces. We demonstrate how our method can configure MSS by considering environmental conditions, runtime execution history, and user goals via reinforcement learning from rich contextual representations grounded in natural language. Our results showcase that the proposed approach enables effective decision making through both offline simulations and online evaluations. Thus, we posit that MSS metareasoning represents a promising direction towards creating intelligent self-adaptive, future-proof software systems that effectively cope with unpredictable change.",1

Simulation results show that the proposed accelerated algorithms can improve the convergence performance compared with the vanilla Q-learning algorithm.",0
"Title: Rapid Update of Reinforcement Learning Objectives for Enhanced Decision Making  Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. At the core of RL algorithms lies the evaluation of action values using either state-action value functions or state-dependent policy evaluations such as Q-values. The most popular method for updating these values is based on temporal difference (TD) learning, which provides updates that converge rapidly to optimal solutions given sufficient experience sampling from different states and actions. However, implementing TD learning can lead to high computational complexity and limited scalability for large problem sizes due to the time required to compute exact action values at each step. To address this issue, we propose an accelerated target update algorithm for improving the performance of Q-learning methods by reducing the number of iterations required for convergence while retaining accuracy. Our approach relies on leveraging both previous samples and their corresponding target estimates to create more effective weighted combinations of past experiences. We demonstrate via simulations that our proposed method outperforms traditional Q-learning by exhibiting faster convergence rates while maintaining consistency across all environments tested. These results highlight the potential utility of our approach in real world applications where computation resources may be limited.",1
"Parameterised actions in reinforcement learning are composed of discrete actions with continuous action-parameters. This provides a framework for solving complex domains that require combining high-level actions with flexible control. The recent P-DQN algorithm extends deep Q-networks to learn over such action spaces. However, it treats all action-parameters as a single joint input to the Q-network, invalidating its theoretical foundations. We analyse the issues with this approach and propose a novel method, multi-pass deep Q-networks, or MP-DQN, to address them. We empirically demonstrate that MP-DQN significantly outperforms P-DQN and other previous algorithms in terms of data efficiency and converged policy performance on the Platform, Robot Soccer Goal, and Half Field Offense domains.",0
"This paper presents a new method called ""Multi-Pass Q-Network"" (MQN) which improves over traditional deep reinforcement learning techniques that use parameterized action spaces. We address three main challenges: firstly, we show how to learn good quality estimates of state value functions efficiently; secondly, we adaptively balance exploitation against exploration using upper confidence bounds based on learned uncertainties; thirdly, we introduce multi-pass learning where multiple estimators update their parameters within each interaction step. Evaluations on suite of continuous control tasks demonstrate improvements in sample efficiency, convergence speed as well as overall performance when compared to single-Q baselines, including TD3. Our MQN algorithm also achieves comparable results as SAC but without the need to re-sample actions during updates and uses an easier to implement architecture. These advancements make our approach a strong alternative for solving difficult continuous control problems using function approximation.",1
"Mapping states to actions in deep reinforcement learning is mainly based on visual information. The commonly used approach for dealing with visual information is to extract pixels from images and use them as state representation for reinforcement learning agent. But, any vision only agent is handicapped by not being able to sense audible cues. Using hearing, animals are able to sense targets that are outside of their visual range. In this work, we propose the use of audio as complementary information to visual only in state representation. We assess the impact of such multi-modal setup in reach-the-goal tasks in ViZDoom environment. Results show that the agent improves its behavior when visual information is accompanied with audio features.",0
"This article discusses the impact of hearing on autonomous agents. We argue that autonomous agents benefit significantly by having access to auditory inputs as part of their sensory repertoire. By examining current state-of-the art systems we identify several advantages offered by incorporating hearing into agent’s perception system, which includes better localization capabilities, increased robustness towards unexpected events, enhanced social interaction skills and improved overall performance across different tasks. Furthermore, we present results using deep neural network models trained end-to-end with audio signals and demonstrate their effectiveness compared to standard vision only approaches. Throughout the course of our research, we found no evidence indicating any negative consequences of adding auditory input to agents. Our work suggests promising new directions in developing more capable and versatile autonomous agents. This study seeks to investigate the benefits of incorporating hearing into autonomous agents' perceptual abilities. Drawing upon current advancements in the field, we examine how audio inputs can enhance agents' capacity for localization, resilience against unforeseen circumstances, social interactions, and overall task performance. Our findings suggest that integrating auditory channels significantly improves agents' effectiveness, resulting in more adept and adaptive behavior. Utilizing artificial neural networks optimized through end-to-end training with audio data substantiates these conclusions, outperforming traditional visual-only methods. Crucially, we discovered no detrimental effects associated with introducing sound stimuli to autonomous agents, signifying positive prospects for further development along these lines. Ultimately, our results contribute novel insights towards constructing more refined and competent autonomous entities capable of tackling diverse challenges.",1

"In recent years, energy harvesting has emerged as a promising technology for powering Internet of Things (IoT) devices that operate in remote and difficult to access areas where traditional grid connection is impossible. However, managing these systems effectively presents significant challenges due to their distributed nature, limited battery capacity, and unpredictability of environmental conditions affecting energy generation rates. To address these issues, we propose using deep reinforcement learning algorithms to develop an autonomous management system that can efficiently manage energy flows within such networks. Our approach leverages data collected from sensors placed throughout the network to adaptively optimize operational parameters of individual nodes based on real-time local energy availability estimates. This enables each node to determine the most optimal times for transmitting sensor readings while minimizing reliance on finite batteries, resulting in more efficient energy usage and longer device lifespans. We evaluate our proposed solution through simulations and experiments on testbeds featuring multiple IoT nodes equipped with solar panels and battery storage units. Results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the art solutions under dynamic environments by reducing peak load on the batteries, extending network lifetime, and increasing overall packet delivery ratios. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques for developing intelligent energy management strategies tailored to specific application requirements in IoT settings.",1
"In order perform a large variety of tasks and to achieve human-level performance in complex real-world environments, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents must be able to learn from their past experiences and gain both knowledge and an accurate representation of their environment from raw sensory inputs. Traditionally, AI agents have suffered from difficulties in using only sensory inputs to obtain a good representation of their environment and then mapping this representation to an efficient control policy. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have provided a solution to this issue. In this study, the performance of different conventional and novel deep reinforcement learning algorithms was analysed.

"Partial domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption across different domains. In this more general and practical scenario, a major challenge is how to select source instances in the shared classes across different domains for positive transfer. To address this issue, we propose a Domain Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (DARL) framework to automatically select source instances in the shared classes for circumventing negative transfer as well as to simultaneously learn transferable features between domains by reducing the domain shift. Specifically, in this framework, we employ deep Q-learning to learn policies for an agent to make selection decisions by approximating the action-value function. Moreover, domain adversarial learning is introduced to learn domain-invariant features for the selected source instances by the agent and the target instances, and also to determine rewards for the agent based on how relevant the selected source instances are to the target domain. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the superior performance of our DARL method over existing state of the arts for partial domain adaptation.",0
"An important problem in reinforcement learning (RL) is adapting agents to new tasks that share some but not all characteristics with previously seen domains. We study this problem under the partial domain adaptation setting where only one source task provides access to expert demonstrations. To achieve effective transfer across tasks, we propose adversarial training techniques based on generative models to maximize reward harvested by RL policies while preserving the integrity of learned representations. Our contributions are twofold: Firstly, we introduce discriminators which aim at predicting whether state transitions come from training or target domains. Secondly, we present methods to improve stability and efficiency via gradient reversal, multi-step updates and regularization terms. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving state-of-the-art performance on several challenging benchmarks including robotic manipulation, locomotion and navigation tasks despite significant differences between original environments. In conclusion, we showcase that adversarial augmentation can significantly facilitate generalization without direct access to additional target data.",1
"In reinforcement learning algorithms, it is a common practice to account for only a single view of the environment to make the desired decisions; however, utilizing multiple views of the environment can help to promote the learning of complicated policies. Since the views may frequently suffer from partial observability, their provided observation can have different levels of importance. In this paper, we present a novel attention-based deep reinforcement learning method in a multi-view environment in which each view can provide various representative information about the environment. Specifically, our method learns a policy to dynamically attend to views of the environment based on their importance in the decision-making process. We evaluate the performance of our method on TORCS racing car simulator and three other complex 3D environments with obstacles.",0
"Increasingly, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used to develop agents that can learn complex behaviors across multiple views of a single environment. However, these methods have faced significant challenges due to their limited ability to effectively handle environments characterized by high complexity, noise, partial observability, and stochasticity.  To address this gap, we propose a novel attention-based approach to DRL which utilizes multi-head self-attention mechanisms to weight different view features based on their relevance at each time step. By leveraging these attention weights, our model is able to selectively focus on informative observations while ignoring irrelevant ones, leading to improved performance and stability in a wide range of challenging domains.  Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong baselines across several benchmark tasks, including continuous control and decision making problems involving real-world datasets such as Atari games and Montezuma's Revenge.

"The game of Tetris is an important benchmark for research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. This paper provides a historical account of the algorithmic developments in Tetris and discusses open challenges. Handcrafted controllers, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning have all contributed to good solutions.

"Title: ""The Game of Tetris in Machine Learning""  Abstract: In recent years, game playing has emerged as a popular area of research in machine learning. In particular, games like chess, Go, and even Starcraft have been used as challenging test beds for developing intelligent agents that can learn from experience and compete against human players. However, there remains a gap in using simpler yet classic arcade games such as Tetris to study machine learning algorithms. This paper seeks to fill that gap by demonstrating how the famous tile-matching puzzle game can serve as an excellent platform for studying several fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We present four case studies on different aspects of Tetris that highlight the use of reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning, planning, and evaluation metrics respectively. Each case study provides insights into solving complex real-world problems through algorithmic design and analyses of learned models. Our results show promising progress towards applying these techniques to other applications beyond just gaming environments. Overall, we aim to inspire more exploration in the intersection of game theory and machine learning, especially in domains where less attention has been given previously.",1
"Pretraining reinforcement learning methods with demonstrations has been an important concept in the study of reinforcement learning since a large amount of computing power is spent on online simulations with existing reinforcement learning algorithms. Pretraining reinforcement learning remains a significant challenge in exploiting expert demonstrations whilst keeping exploration potentials, especially for value based methods. In this paper, we propose a pretraining method for soft Q-learning. Our work is inspired by pretraining methods for actor-critic algorithms since soft Q-learning is a value based algorithm that is equivalent to policy gradient. The proposed method is based on $\gamma$-discounted biased policy evaluation with entropy regularization, which is also the updating target of soft Q-learning. Our method is evaluated on various tasks from Atari 2600. Experiments show that our method effectively learns from imperfect demonstrations, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods that learn from expert demonstrations.",0
"This can make things easier for you: The main motivation behind our work on pretraining soft Q-learning agents using imperfect demonstrations is that we believe it has great potential applications, ranging from automating repetitive tasks to improving communication between humans and machines by providing them with more natural ways to interact. We have found that these methods have several advantages over traditional reinforcement learning techniques when dealing with high-dimensional state spaces and sparse rewards. In addition, these approaches allow us to leverage large amounts of data collected through human interactions with virtual environments, reducing the need for manual engineering of reward functions. Furthermore, our results show that these systems can learn policies that closely match those learned from perfect demonstrations and even outperform them in certain cases. Our hope is that this research inspires future work towards making machine learning models more intelligent and adaptive to real-world conditions.",1
"Learning an effective representation for high-dimensional data is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) such as Deep Q networks (DQN) achieves remarkable success in computer games by learning deeply encoded representation from convolution networks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet very effective method for representation learning with DRL algorithms. Our key insight is that features learned by DRL algorithms are highly correlated, which interferes with learning. By adding a regularized loss that penalizes correlation in latent features (with only slight computation), we decorrelate features represented by deep neural networks incrementally. On 49 Atari games, with the same regularization factor, our decorrelation algorithms perform $70\%$ in terms of human-normalized scores, which is $40\%$ better than DQN. In particular, ours performs better than DQN on 39 games with 4 close ties and lost only slightly on $6$ games. Empirical results also show that the decorrelation method applies to Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN) and significantly boosts performance. Further experiments on the losing games show that our decorelation algorithms can win over DQN and QR-DQN with a fined tuned regularization factor.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising fields of artificial intelligence research. DRL algorithms allow agents to learn complex behaviors by interacting with their environments and receiving rewards or penalties based on the consequences of their actions. However, training these models can often suffer from instability, slow convergence, and overfitting due to the high dimensionality and nonlinear nature of the problem space.  One approach to mitigating these issues is through decorrelation techniques, which seek to reduce correlations between features in the state representation used by the agent. By doing so, the policy gradient updates become less sensitive to changes in any single feature and more robust to noise and outliers. In this paper, we investigate several different methods for decorrelating state representations in continuous control DRL problems using neural networks.  We begin by introducing two simple baseline approaches: temporal difference error smoothing and experience buffer filtering. We then describe three novel decorrelation techniques that build upon these baselines: randomizing network activations, additive Gaussian noise injection, and a variational autoencoder regularization term. Each of these methods is evaluated across a range of challenging continuous control tasks with varying levels of complexity.  Our experiments show that all three new decorrelation techniques consistently improve stability, speed, and final performance compared to the baseline approaches. Furthermore, the effects of each method are found to depend on the specific characteristics of the task at hand, suggesting that careful selection of appropriate decorrelation techniques may be crucial for achieving strong results in practice. These findings contribute important insights into the design and implementation of effective deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential value of decorrelation techniques in advancing the state of the art in artificial i",1
"While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have drawn increasing attention, their posterior inference remains challenging, due to the high-dimensional and over-parameterized nature. To address this issue, several highly flexible and scalable variational inference procedures based on the idea of particle optimization have been proposed. These methods directly optimize a set of particles to approximate the target posterior. However, their application to BNNs often yields sub-optimal performance, as such methods have a particular failure mode on over-parameterized models. In this paper, we propose to solve this issue by performing particle optimization directly in the space of regression functions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method successfully overcomes this issue, and outperforms strong baselines in a variety of tasks including prediction, defense against adversarial examples, and reinforcement learning.",0
"Inferential models trained using particle optimization techniques have recently shown state-of-the-art results across many real world applications such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition tasks. These models use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in function space to optimize parameters which makes them computationally efficient and effective at capturing complex dependencies. While these methods have gained attention in recent years there remains scope for improvement in certain application domains. One significant area where performance gains can be achieved is by incorporating prior knowledge into the model training process through Bayesian inference. This paper presents novel approaches for combining particle optimization with Bayesian neural networks which have been validated on several benchmark datasets. Our experimental evaluations show that our proposed approach outperforms other well known SOTA techniques while requiring less computational resources thus making them suitable for deployment across different platforms. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings and motivation behind our work and provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of combining particle optimization techniques with bayesian frameworks for neural network modelling. Finally we conclude by highlighting future research directions that may further improve these models and expand their applicability in real world scenarios.",1
"Policy gradient algorithms are among the best candidates for the much anticipated application of reinforcement learning to real-world control tasks, such as the ones arising in robotics. However, the trial-and-error nature of these methods introduces safety issues whenever the learning phase itself must be performed on a physical system. In this paper, we address a specific safety formulation, where danger is encoded in the reward signal and the learning agent is constrained to never worsen its performance. By studying actor-only policy gradient from a stochastic optimization perspective, we establish improvement guarantees for a wide class of parametric policies, generalizing existing results on Gaussian policies. This, together with novel upper bounds on the variance of policy gradient estimators, allows to identify those meta-parameter schedules that guarantee monotonic improvement with high probability. The two key meta-parameters are the step size of the parameter updates and the batch size of the gradient estimators. By a joint, adaptive selection of these meta-parameters, we obtain a safe policy gradient algorithm.",0
"This paper presents novel methods for safely improving policy gradient algorithms used to train agents that interact with real world environments. We propose two new approaches called ""Smoothed Advantage Function"" (SAF) and ""Monte Carlo Rollouts using Advantage Optimization"" (MCRPO). SAF adds noise to the advantage function during training to reduce correlation errors while preserving high rewarding actions. MCRPO combines Monte Carlo rollouts with advantage optimization allowing better exploration. Both methods were tested on OpenAI benchmarks achieving state-of-the-art results outperforming existing alternatives. Our work has implications for safe learning in complex real world systems where safety is critical.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning method in a reinforcement learning setting, based on evolution strategies (ES), exploration in parameter space and deterministic policy gradients. ES methods are easy to parallelize, which is desirable for modern training architectures; however, such methods typically require a huge number of samples for effective training. We use deterministic policy gradients during adaptation and other techniques to compensate for the sample-efficiency problem while maintaining the inherent scalability of ES methods. We demonstrate that our method achieves good results compared to gradient-based meta-learning in high-dimensional control tasks in the MuJoCo simulator. In addition, because of gradient-free methods in the meta-training phase, which do not need information about gradients and policies in adaptation training, we predict and confirm our algorithm performs better in tasks that need multi-step adaptation.",0
"This paper presents a meta-reinforcement learning (meta RL) approach that leverages distributional exploration parameters learned using evolution strategies (ES). We propose a framework where ES optimizes the distribution over parameterized action spaces rather than individual actions, allowing us to efficiently learn robust policies across multiple tasks. Our method learns a distribution of exploration parameters conditioned on each task, which enables fine-grained control over how much uncertainty the agent injects during training. In addition, we introduce a novel objective function for gradient-based optimization of continuous distributions to accelerate the search process and increase sample efficiency. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show improved performance across multiple benchmark domains, including gridworld environments and Atari games. Furthermore, we provide insights into the behavior of the learned distributions and highlight their potential benefits. Overall, our work provides new perspectives on meta RL and explores opportunities for future research in the area.",1
"Evaluation of deep reinforcement learning (RL) is inherently challenging. In particular, learned policies are largely opaque, and hypotheses about the behavior of deep RL agents are difficult to test in black-box environments. Considerable effort has gone into addressing opacity, but almost no effort has been devoted to producing high quality environments for experimental evaluation of agent behavior. We present TOYBOX, a new high-performance, open-source* subset of Atari environments re-designed for the experimental evaluation of deep RL. We show that TOYBOX enables a wide range of experiments and analyses that are impossible in other environments.   *https://kdl-umass.github.io/Toybox/",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches towards achieving human-level intelligence in artificial agents. However, designing environments suitable for evaluating DRL algorithms remains a challenge due to the high complexity and uncertainty present in real-world tasks. This study presents Toybox, a suite of novel environments designed specifically for experimental evaluation of DRL algorithms.  Toybox includes eight challenging domains based on classical control problems that have been adapted to take advantage of recent advances in computer graphics. Each domain offers unique characteristics, such as partially observable states, stochastic transitions, continuous action spaces, adversarial behaviors, hierarchical task structures, and more, which make them suitable for testing various aspects of DRL algorithms. Furthermore, each environment is accompanied by comprehensive baseline results achieved using state-of-the-art DRL methods, allowing researchers to easily compare their own models against existing benchmarks.  The authors evaluate several popular DRL algorithms on Toybox, demonstrating the effectiveness of these new environments in identifying strengths and weaknesses of different algorithmic variants. Their experiments reveal interesting insights into how various DRL algorithms perform across multiple problem classes and identify areas requiring further investigation. Overall, the Toybox suite provides the community with well-designed, challenging testbeds critical for driving progress in DRL research and developing intelligent agents capable of mastering complex real-world tasks.",1
"Although deep reinforcement learning has advanced significantly over the past several years, sample efficiency remains a major challenge. Careful choice of input representations can help improve efficiency depending on the structure present in the problem. In this work, we present an attention-based method to project inputs into an efficient representation space that is invariant under changes to input ordering. We show that our proposed representation results in a search space that is a factor of m! smaller for inputs of m objects. Our experiments demonstrate improvements in sample efficiency for policy gradient methods on a variety of tasks. We show that our representation allows us to solve problems that are otherwise intractable when using naive approaches.",0
"Object exchangeability refers to the idea that any object can be replaced by another object without affecting the outcome of a particular task or problem. In the field of reinforcement learning (RL), the concept of exchangeability has been explored as a means of improving efficiency and robustness in RL algorithms. However, most prior work on exchangeability in RL has focused on discrete tasks or state spaces, rather than continuous ones. This extended abstract presents our latest research on incorporating object exchangeability into deep reinforcement learning models trained using continuous action spaces. Our approach involves training neural network policies to generate actions that are invariant to object substitutions, which allows them to generalize across different objects. We evaluate our method on several benchmark control problems, including robotic manipulation tasks and simulations of navigation systems, and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Overall, our results suggest that incorporating exchangeability into deep RL models can lead to more efficient and effective solutions for complex real-world tasks. Future directions may involve extending our approach to other domains such as natural language processing or computer vision.",1
"A policy is said to be robust if it maximizes the reward while considering a bad, or even adversarial, model. In this work we formalize two new criteria of robustness to action uncertainty. Specifically, we consider two scenarios in which the agent attempts to perform an action $a$, and (i) with probability $\alpha$, an alternative adversarial action $\bar a$ is taken, or (ii) an adversary adds a perturbation to the selected action in the case of continuous action space. We show that our criteria are related to common forms of uncertainty in robotics domains, such as the occurrence of abrupt forces, and suggest algorithms in the tabular case. Building on the suggested algorithms, we generalize our approach to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and provide extensive experiments in the various MuJoCo domains. Our experiments show that not only does our approach produce robust policies, but it also improves the performance in the absence of perturbations. This generalization indicates that action-robustness can be thought of as implicit regularization in RL problems.",0
"Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training agents to perform complex tasks, particularly in domains where obtaining optimal solutions remains difficult using traditional methods. However, most RL algorithms assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed during the entire training process, which may lead to suboptimal policies if the agent must adapt to changes in the environment. In this work, we propose action robust reinforcement learning (ARRL), a new framework that leverages intrinsic motivation mechanisms within an actor-critic architecture to encourage exploration and improve robustness to variations in task environments. Our approach enables agents trained under ARRL to maintain better performance even when faced with significant environmental changes, making them ideal candidates for real-world applications in continuous control settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through several experiments across diverse problem spaces including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we discuss possible use cases of ARRL in robotics, autonomous systems, and other fields demanding reliable agents capable of operating in dynamic environments.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging control tasks. However, these methods typically struggle with achieving effective exploration and are extremely sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters. One reason is that most approaches use a noisy version of their operating policy to explore - thereby limiting the range of exploration. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (CERL), a scalable framework that comprises a portfolio of policies that simultaneously explore and exploit diverse regions of the solution space. A collection of learners - typically proven algorithms like TD3 - optimize over varying time-horizons leading to this diverse portfolio. All learners contribute to and use a shared replay buffer to achieve greater sample efficiency. Computational resources are dynamically distributed to favor the best learners as a form of online algorithm selection. Neuroevolution binds this entire process to generate a single emergent learner that exceeds the capabilities of any individual learner. Experiments in a range of continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that the emergent learner significantly outperforms its composite learners while remaining overall more sample-efficient - notably solving the Mujoco Humanoid benchmark where all of its composite learners (TD3) fail entirely in isolation.",0
"Collaborative evolutionary reinforcement learning (CERL) is an approach to artificial intelligence that combines elements of evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn from each other as well as their own experiences. In CERL, multiple agent populations work together to solve complex tasks by sharing knowledge, collaborating on solutions, and competing against one another.  One of the key features of CERL is that it allows agents to build upon each other’s successes rather than starting from scratch every time they encounter a new problem. This is achieved through a process called “coevolution,” where two or more populations of agents interact and adapt to each other over time. Coevolution enables agents to leverage their collective experience and intelligence to overcome challenges that would be difficult for individual agents to tackle alone.  Another important aspect of CERL is its use of reinforcement learning algorithms, which allow agents to improve their performance by trial and error. By receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions, agents can learn to make better decisions and achieve higher levels of performance. The incorporation of coevolution into these learning processes further increases the agents’ ability to discover effective strategies and adapt to changing environments.  The potential applications of CERL span across numerous domains, including robotics, game design, social simulation, economics, and scientific discovery. As future research continues to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, collaborative evolutionary reinforcement learning has the potential to become an increasingly important tool for solving complex problems and driving innovation.",1
"Recent success in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has been dominated by model-free approaches which, unlike model-based approaches, do not suffer from representational limitations in making assumptions about the world dynamics and model errors inevitable in complex domains. However, they require a lot of experiences compared to model-based approaches that are typically more sample-efficient. We propose to combine the benefits of the two approaches by presenting an integrated approach called Curious Meta-Controller. Our approach alternates adaptively between model-based and model-free control using a curiosity feedback based on the learning progress of a neural model of the dynamics in a learned latent space. We demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the sample efficiency and achieve near-optimal performance on learning robotic reaching and grasping tasks from raw-pixel input in both dense and sparse reward settings.",0
"In our latest work, we aimed to develop a meta controller that could dynamically switch between model-based and model-free control during deep reinforcement learning (RL). We proposed the use of curiosity as the driving force behind these transitions, allowing the agent to explore and learn from new experiences while still achieving efficient task performance. Our approach, which we call ""Curious Meta-controller,"" combines the benefits of both model-based and model-free RL into one cohesive framework, enabling agents to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation. By utilizing a novel measure of intrinsic motivation based on information theory, our meta-controller effectively guides agents towards states where they are most likely to gain valuable new insights. Experimental results across various domains showcased significant improvements over state-of-the art methods in terms of efficiency, sample complexity, and overall performance. These findings suggest that Curious Meta-controller holds great potential for advancing artificial intelligence, opening up exciting possibilities for intelligent systems capable of adapting to changing environments and tackling complex tasks. Overall, our work represents an important step towards more effective and flexible agents, paving the way for future research in automated decision making under uncertainty.",1
"We study online reinforcement learning for finite-horizon deterministic control systems with {\it arbitrary} state and action spaces. Suppose that the transition dynamics and reward function is unknown, but the state and action space is endowed with a metric that characterizes the proximity between different states and actions. We provide a surprisingly simple upper-confidence reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a function approximation oracle to estimate optimistic Q functions from experiences. We show that the regret of the algorithm after $K$ episodes is $O(HL(KH)^{\frac{d-1}{d}}) $ where $L$ is a smoothness parameter, and $d$ is the doubling dimension of the state-action space with respect to the given metric. We also establish a near-matching regret lower bound. The proposed method can be adapted to work for more structured transition systems, including the finite-state case and the case where value functions are linear combinations of features, where the method also achieve the optimal regret.",0
"This paper presents a framework for controlling agents acting in high dimensions without direct access to their reward function. We propose a novel algorithm that learns an optimal control policy by minimizing regret towards some unknown metric defined on state-action pairs. By designing a smooth and strictly convex metric space, we can guarantee convergence to locally optimal policies under mild assumptions. Our method requires no prior knowledge of the dimensionality, structure, or scaling of the environment. Experiments show that our approach outperforms standard model-free reinforcement learning methods, even those equipped with function approximation, in difficult exploration tasks ranging from continuous robotics to Atari games. By providing a flexible alternative to shaping rewards or model-based planning, we hope to open up new possibilities for robust and versatile decision making in complex systems.",1
"Face hallucination is a domain-specific super-resolution problem that aims to generate a high-resolution (HR) face image from a low-resolution~(LR) input. In contrast to the existing patch-wise super-resolution models that divide a face image into regular patches and independently apply LR to HR mapping to each patch, we implement deep reinforcement learning and develop a novel attention-aware face hallucination (Attention-FH) framework, which recurrently learns to attend a sequence of patches and performs facial part enhancement by fully exploiting the global interdependency of the image. Specifically, our proposed framework incorporates two components: a recurrent policy network for dynamically specifying a new attended region at each time step based on the status of the super-resolved image and the past attended region sequence, and a local enhancement network for selected patch hallucination and global state updating. The Attention-FH model jointly learns the recurrent policy network and local enhancement network through maximizing a long-term reward that reflects the hallucination result with respect to the whole HR image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Attention-FH significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on in-the-wild face images with large pose and illumination variations.",0
"Imagine if we could create images from text descriptions that look so real they seem like photographs. This research makes progress toward developing artificial intelligence capable of such ""hallucinations."" We present a novel model trained on large amounts of data using reinforcement learning techniques. Our experiments show impressive results, producing vivid, lifelike faces even from brief texts. Additionally, our method requires far less computational power compared to prior work, allowing us to push the boundaries of generative image synthesis. Further exploration of these methods may one day enable machines to replace cameras altogether.",1
"In this letter, we address the problem of controlling energy storage systems (ESSs) for arbitrage in real-time electricity markets under price uncertainty. We first formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, and then develop a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm to learn a stochastic control policy that maps a set of available information processed by a recurrent neural network to ESSs' charging/discharging actions. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our algorithm using real-time electricity prices from PJM.",0
"In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to finding arbitrage opportunities in energy storage systems participating on electricity markets. We model energy storage as continuous state spaces where battery charge level can be controlled using two actions: increasing the power consumption at some fixed efficiency, or decreasing it. Our objective function captures profits from both participation in regulation services markets where fast response times and high precision are required, as well as those derived from more conventional frequency containment reserve products. These services have different market windows and requirements regarding state-of-charge of batteries, which motivates the need for multi-task RL approaches. To account for the safety constraints present during regulation service provision, we introduce a novel safe policy improvement algorithm based on linearly projecting the gradient update onto an ellipsoidal constraint set that represents feasible battery states given by physics principles such as SoC bounds, capacity degradation due to aging mechanisms related to cycling wear of batteries, and maximum charging/discharging rates, etc. Experimental evaluation shows that our DRL agent outperforms rule-based baseline policies that were manually engineered by human experts under standard scenarios of high demand periods. Interestingly, however, our models exhibit significant sample complexity, making their application in real-life deployments a challenging task. We finish discussing potential remedies to reduce conservatism and improve exploration.",1
"Motor control is a set of time-varying muscle excitations which generate desired motions for a biomechanical system. Muscle excitations cannot be directly measured from live subjects. An alternative approach is to estimate muscle activations using inverse motion-driven simulation. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method to estimate the muscle excitations in simulated biomechanical systems. Here, we introduce a custom-made reward function which incentivizes faster point-to-point tracking of target motion. Moreover, we deploy two new techniques, namely, episode-based hard update and dual buffer experience replay, to avoid feedback training loops. The proposed method is tested in four simulated 2D and 3D environments with 6 to 24 axial muscles. The results show that the models were able to learn muscle excitations for given motions after nearly 100,000 simulated steps. Moreover, the root mean square error in point-to-point reaching of the target across experiments was less than 1% of the length of the domain of motion. Our reinforcement learning method is far from the conventional dynamic approaches as the muscle control is derived functionally by a set of distributed neurons. This can open paths for neural activity interpretation of this phenomenon.",0
"Muscle excitation estimation is an important aspect of biomechanical simulation as accurate muscle excitations can significantly improve the realism and accuracy of simulations. In traditional methods, the calculation of muscle excitations relies on manual tuning or optimization using numerical algorithms, which can lead to high computational costs and limited exploration of the solution space. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that uses neuroevolution through augmented reality (NAF) reinforcement learning to automatically estimate muscle excitations in biomechanical simulations. Our method trains a neural network controller to optimize muscle activations during simulation by maximizing the similarity between simulated movement trajectories and those generated from measured motion capture data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark tasks, where our learned controllers achieve better performance compared to manually tuned ones. Additionally, we show that our trained controllers can generalize well across different scenarios and movements. Overall, our work has significant implications in improving the efficiency and quality of biomechanical simulations, particularly in applications such as robotics and human movement analysis.",1
"Meta-learning is a tool that allows us to build sample-efficient learning systems. Here we show that, once meta-trained, LSTM Meta-Learners aren't just faster learners than their sample-inefficient deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) brethren, but that they actually pursue fundamentally different learning trajectories. We study their learning dynamics on three sets of structured tasks for which the corresponding learning dynamics of DL and RL systems have been previously described: linear regression (Saxe et al., 2013), nonlinear regression (Rahaman et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018), and contextual bandits (Schaul et al., 2019). In each case, while sample-inefficient DL and RL Learners uncover the task structure in a staggered manner, meta-trained LSTM Meta-Learners uncover almost all task structure concurrently, congruent with the patterns expected from Bayes-optimal inference algorithms. This has implications for research areas wherever the learning behaviour itself is of interest, such as safety, curriculum design, and human-in-the-loop machine learning.",0
"Learning dynamics refer to how one goes from knowing nothing at all about something to being able to perform complex tasks that require significant knowledge. Traditionally, research on learning has focused on understanding learning mechanisms as they apply to humans. These investigations have led to important insights into how people process sensory inputs, attend to relevant stimuli in their environment, retain memories over time, make decisions based on incomplete information, solve problems requiring logic and planning, coordinate and execute motor actions—the list could go on ad nauseam but you probably already know what I mean if you’ve ever read any psychology papers before! In short, there exists a vast literature dedicated to studying human learning processes. This body of work has provided us with a detailed account of how typical (human) learners acquire skills throughout development. By contrast, we know very little about meta-learning. Meta-learning refers to the ability to learn how to learn. Humans can take different experiences that they accumulate through life and integrate them so that they become increasingly better at learning new things: for instance, they can generalize previously acquired knowledge to novel situations; they can improve their performance after receiving feedback, even across different domains; and so forth and so on—there again the examples are endless! However, compared to our deep understanding of human learning mechanisms, our knowledge regarding meta-learners remains mostly rudimentary at this stage (to say the least). We still do not fully grasp the essence of how these exceptional minds build up knowledge as they grow more intelligent each year while progressing through school education—or why some individuals outperform others academically or professionally despite having comparable initial intellectual abilities! What we need is ne",1
"Lack of performance when it comes to continual learning over non-stationary distributions of data remains a major challenge in scaling neural network learning to more human realistic settings. In this work we propose a new conceptualization of the continual learning problem in terms of a temporally symmetric trade-off between transfer and interference that can be optimized by enforcing gradient alignment across examples. We then propose a new algorithm, Meta-Experience Replay (MER), that directly exploits this view by combining experience replay with optimization based meta-learning. This method learns parameters that make interference based on future gradients less likely and transfer based on future gradients more likely. We conduct experiments across continual lifelong supervised learning benchmarks and non-stationary reinforcement learning environments demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for continual learning. Our experiments show that the gap between the performance of MER and baseline algorithms grows both as the environment gets more non-stationary and as the fraction of the total experiences stored gets smaller.",0
"As machine learning models become more powerful, they often need to learn multiple tasks simultaneously while minimizing interference from previously learned knowledge. In ""Learning to Learn Without Forgetting"", we propose maximizing transfer and minimizing interference as key components of effective multi-task learning. We present empirical evidence that demonstrates how these two components interact during learning, and showcase their importance in enabling successful transfer. Additionally, our approach provides insight into the process of learning, allowing us to gain understanding of why certain learning methods succeed or fail. This work has important implications for fields such as education and artificial intelligence, where adaptability and flexibility are highly valued. By considering both transfer and interference in tandem, our findings provide guidance on designing effective multi-task learning algorithms capable of handling complex real-world tasks.",1
"Air traffic control is a real-time safety-critical decision making process in highly dynamic and stochastic environments. In today's aviation practice, a human air traffic controller monitors and directs many aircraft flying through its designated airspace sector. With the fast growing air traffic complexity in traditional (commercial airliners) and low-altitude (drones and eVTOL aircraft) airspace, an autonomous air traffic control system is needed to accommodate high density air traffic and ensure safe separation between aircraft. We propose a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that is able to identify and resolve conflicts between aircraft in a high-density, stochastic, and dynamic en-route sector with multiple intersections and merging points. The proposed framework utilizes an actor-critic model, A2C that incorporates the loss function from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to help stabilize the learning process. In addition we use a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme where one neural network is learned and shared by all agents in the environment. We show that our framework is both scalable and efficient for large number of incoming aircraft to achieve extremely high traffic throughput with safety guarantee. We evaluate our model via extensive simulations in the BlueSky environment. Results show that our framework is able to resolve 99.97% and 100% of all conflicts both at intersections and merging points, respectively, in extreme high-density air traffic scenarios.",0
"Imagine you are writing this abstract as if talking to someone who knows nothing about air traffic control. Be clear and concise but accurate. Here we go! Air traffic management is a complex task that involves managing hundreds of aircrafts simultaneously to ensure safe and efficient operations at busy airports worldwide. With the increasing demands on air travel, human air traffic controllers face significant challenges coping with ever growing workloads while maintaining high levels of safety. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to automate many tasks previously done by humans such as image recognition, speech understanding, decision making and more recently autonomous driving. These developments raise the question whether machines could soon replace human operators working within critical infrastructure systems such as aviation. In this article, we present our approach to train deep multi agent reinforcement learning models capable of controlling multiple aircrafts simultaneously under different conditions in real time simulations mimicking actual airport scenarios. We demonstrate their superior performance over traditional methods based on rule sets such as TCAS and conflict resolution algorithms used today. Our findings provide evidence for deploying machine agents into these domains suggesting potentially large improvements in terms of scalability, efficiency and reliability which may bring new perspectives to tackle similar challenges in other domains requiring coordination among multiple entities. However, important questions remain unanswered regarding responsibility allocation, accountability, security guarantees and ethical implications when letting artificial agents make life or death decisions without direct supervision. Further research is necessary examining how society deals with automation introductions involving moral implications before transferring these technologies to operational environments. Despite the potential benefits coming with AI automation, a rigorous debate on impact assessment must ensue",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is about sequential decision making and is traditionally opposed to supervised learning (SL) and unsupervised learning (USL). In RL, given the current state, the agent makes a decision that may influence the next state as opposed to SL (and USL) where, the next state remains the same, regardless of the decisions taken, either in batch or online learning. Although this difference is fundamental between SL and RL, there are connections that have been overlooked. In particular, we prove in this paper that gradient policy method can be cast as a supervised learning problem where true label are replaced with discounted rewards. We provide a new proof of policy gradient methods (PGM) that emphasizes the tight link with the cross entropy and supervised learning. We provide a simple experiment where we interchange label and pseudo rewards. We conclude that other relationships with SL could be made if we modify the reward functions wisely.",0
"This paper investigates the similarities between Policy Gradient Methods (PGM) in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Learning (SL), two fields that have traditionally been viewed as distinct. By exploring the commonalities between these approaches, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of both domains and identify potential opportunities for cross-pollination. We begin by providing an overview of PGM in RL and SL, highlighting their key differences and shared characteristics. Next, we present several case studies where principles from one domain were successfully applied in the other, resulting in improved performance and new insights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest directions for future research. Our work contributes to ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between RL and SL and enhance our ability to solve complex problems using machine learning techniques.",1
"Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as Q-learning [Watkins, Dayan 92] have been widely used in practice and can achieve human level performance in applications such as video games [Mnih et al. 15]. Recently, equipped with the idea of optimism in the face of uncertainty, Q-learning algorithms [Jin, Allen-Zhu, Bubeck, Jordan 18] can be proven to be sample efficient for discrete tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which have finite number of states and actions. In this work, we present an efficient model-free Q-learning based algorithm in MDPs with a natural metric on the state-action space--hence extending efficient model-free Q-learning algorithms to continuous state-action space. Compared to previous model-based RL algorithms for metric spaces [Kakade, Kearns, Langford 03], our algorithm does not require access to a black-box planning oracle.",0
"Title: Efficient Model-Free Reinforcement Learning in High Dimensional State Spaces Using Optimization Algorithms Abstract: In recent years there has been significant progress in model-based RL algorithms that have yielded state-of-the art results on several benchmarks tasks. However, most methods still rely on low dimensional state spaces. Real world applications such as robotics often require high dimensions making many existing methods computationally intractable. Furthermore, solving Bellman equations becomes difficult even with approximate dynamic programming (ADP) due to the curse of dimensionality which leads to slow convergence rates. We present a novel algorithm based on linearly scaling gradient descent using trust region optimization techniques to achieve efficient learning in large scale high dimensional environments. Our approach outperforms baseline models across all metrics including policy evaluation, Monte Carlo return estimation, and model selection consistency. Moreover our method also offers a significantly faster training speed compared to competing approaches while maintaining comparative performance at inference time. This allows us to efficiently solve optimal control problems with realistic constraints found in robotic systems. Introduction: The problem of learning an optimal policy from raw sensor inputs, also known as reinforcement learning, is one of the central goals of artificial intelligence research [1]. Recently, we have seen the development of deep neural network architectures capable of approaching human level skill in tasks like playing games [2], but they are mostly limited to relatively small action spaces. Most approaches take advantage of the linear structure provided by the Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, but these representations can become intractable",1
"Value-function approximation methods that operate in batch mode have foundational importance to reinforcement learning (RL). Finite sample guarantees for these methods often crucially rely on two types of assumptions: (1) mild distribution shift, and (2) representation conditions that are stronger than realizability. However, the necessity (""why do we need them?"") and the naturalness (""when do they hold?"") of such assumptions have largely eluded the literature. In this paper, we revisit these assumptions and provide theoretical results towards answering the above questions, and make steps towards a deeper understanding of value-function approximation.",0
"Here are some possible abstracts based on different interpretations of ""batch reinforcement learning"":  Abstract 1: In batch reinforcement learning, large numbers of experiences are collected simultaneously using multiple agents. This allows for more efficient exploration and faster convergence compared to traditional single-agent approaches. However, careful consideration must be given to the nature of these interactions, as well as the choice of reward function, to ensure that the resulting policies align with human values and goals. This paper presents a framework for addressing these challenges and discusses experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.  Abstract 2: When training deep neural networks with reinforcement learning algorithms, the standard practice is to train one agent at a time using small amounts of experience obtained from random actions taken by that agent alone. In contrast, batch reinforcement learning enables us to collect data from many agents at once and train them jointly using that shared dataset. This leads to significant improvements in sample efficiency, model performance, and stability across various benchmark domains. We provide detailed experiments comparing both methods, offering insights into how each performs under various conditions such as task difficulty and agent diversity. By identifying key tradeoffs between these two popular paradigms, we aim to guide practitioners towards choosing the optimal methodology depending on their specific requirements.  These are just two possibilities - there may be other ways to frame a study related to batch reinforcement learning. Please provide further details if you need me to generate additional options for your paper.",1
"Vision-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically obtains performance benefit by using high capacity and relatively large convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, a large network leads to higher inference costs (power, latency, silicon area, MAC count). Many inference optimizations have been developed for CNNs. Some optimization techniques offer theoretical efficiency, such as sparsity, but designing actual hardware to support them is difficult. On the other hand, distillation is a simple general-purpose optimization technique which is broadly applicable for transferring knowledge from a trained, high capacity teacher network to an untrained, low capacity student network. DQN distillation extended the original distillation idea to transfer information stored in a high performance, high capacity teacher Q-function trained via the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm. Our work adapts the DQN distillation work to the actor-critic Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. PPO is simple to implement and has much higher performance than the seminal DQN algorithm. We show that a distilled PPO student can attain far higher performance compared to a DQN teacher. We also show that a low capacity distilled student is generally able to outperform a low capacity agent that directly trains in the environment. Finally, we show that distillation, followed by ""fine-tuning"" in the environment, enables the distilled PPO student to achieve parity with teacher performance. In general, the lessons learned in this work should transfer to other modern actor-critic RL algorithms.",0
This paper presents new techniques for speeding up training on large datasets for reinforcement learning agents trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The proposed methods use mini batch distillation strategies that allow us to take advantage of stochastic gradient descent and recent advances in data compression such as Haar wavelets and JPEG quantization. Our results show that these novel distillation strategies can significantly accelerate training while preserving accuracy. In addition we discuss theoretical analysis of the algorithms and their limitations. We hope our work inspires future research into more efficient methods for training reinforcement learning agents and other machine learning models.,1
"As an efficient and scalable graph neural network, GraphSAGE has enabled an inductive capability for inferring unseen nodes or graphs by aggregating subsampled local neighborhoods and by learning in a mini-batch gradient descent fashion. The neighborhood sampling used in GraphSAGE is effective in order to improve computing and memory efficiency when inferring a batch of target nodes with diverse degrees in parallel. Despite this advantage, the default uniform sampling suffers from high variance in training and inference, leading to sub-optimum accuracy. We propose a new data-driven sampling approach to reason about the real-valued importance of a neighborhood by a non-linear regressor, and to use the value as a criterion for subsampling neighborhoods. The regressor is learned using a value-based reinforcement learning. The implied importance for each combination of vertex and neighborhood is inductively extracted from the negative classification loss output of GraphSAGE. As a result, in an inductive node classification benchmark using three datasets, our method enhanced the baseline using the uniform sampling, outperforming recent variants of a graph neural network in accuracy.",0
"Advances in graph representation learning have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to capture complex relationships among entities in large scale graphs. One popular technique is GraphSAGE which utilizes node sampling to generate embeddings that can effectively preserve structural properties. However, current implementations rely on heuristics that may result in suboptimal performance across different datasets and tasks. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that dynamically adjusts the number of sampled neighbors per node based on the underlying structure of each graph. This leads to significantly improved results while remaining efficient in terms of time and space complexity. We evaluate our method across multiple benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements over existing methods. Our proposed framework provides insights into how well-suited graph embedding techniques such as GraphSAGE can benefit from more informed decisions during training.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its worth in a series of artificial domains, and is beginning to show some successes in real-world scenarios. However, much of the research advances in RL are often hard to leverage in real-world systems due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice. We present a set of nine unique challenges that must be addressed to productionize RL to real world problems. For each of these challenges, we specify the exact meaning of the challenge, present some approaches from the literature, and specify some metrics for evaluating that challenge. An approach that addresses all nine challenges would be applicable to a large number of real world problems. We also present an example domain that has been modified to present these challenges as a testbed for practical RL research.",0
"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve and become more advanced, one area that has seen significant progress in recent years is reinforcement learning. This subfield of machine learning focuses on training algorithms to make decisions by maximizing rewards received from their actions in complex environments. However, while there have been many successful applications of reinforcement learning in simulated domains, such as game playing, there remain numerous challenges associated with applying these techniques in real-world settings. In this paper, we discuss several key challenges facing real-world RL and highlight potential solutions towards addressing them. We hope that our work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing robust RL methods suitable for deployment in diverse and dynamic real-world scenarios.",1
"We present RL-GAN-Net, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent provides fast and robust control of a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our framework is applied to point cloud shape completion that converts noisy, partial point cloud data into a high-fidelity completed shape by controlling the GAN. While a GAN is unstable and hard to train, we circumvent the problem by (1) training the GAN on the latent space representation whose dimension is reduced compared to the raw point cloud input and (2) using an RL agent to find the correct input to the GAN to generate the latent space representation of the shape that best fits the current input of incomplete point cloud. The suggested pipeline robustly completes point cloud with large missing regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train an RL agent to control the GAN, which effectively learns the highly nonlinear mapping from the input noise of the GAN to the latent space of point cloud. The RL agent replaces the need for complex optimization and consequently makes our technique real time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipelines can be used to enhance the classification accuracy of point cloud with missing data.",0
"Title: A Novel Approach to Real-time Point Cloud Shape Completion using Reinforcement Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (RL-GAN-Net)  Abstract:  In recent years, point cloud data has become increasingly popular due to its ability to capture detailed three-dimensional environments and objects. However, real-time shape completion remains a significant challenge as existing methods often produce incomplete results and lack detail. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (RL-GAN-Net). Our method uses a generator network consisting of a conditional GAN architecture controlled by a separate agent trained using reinforcement learning techniques. This design allows us to train agents directly on raw sensor inputs rather than preprocessed data, enabling efficient real-time performance without the need for high computational resources. By incorporating reward feedback into our training process, we can further improve the quality of generated shapes while minimizing error accumulation over time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RL-GAN-Net achieves superior completeness rates compared to current state-of-the-art methods, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous driving.  Note: This model outperforms previous models by significantly improving completeness rates through real-time control using reinforcement learning, demonstrating its suitability for real-world applications requiring efficient processing times.",1
"Due to burdensome data requirements, learning from demonstration often falls short of its promise to allow users to quickly and naturally program robots. Demonstrations are inherently ambiguous and incomplete, making correct generalization to unseen situations difficult without a large number of demonstrations in varying conditions. By contrast, humans are often able to learn complex tasks from a single demonstration (typically observations without action labels) by leveraging context learned over a lifetime. Inspired by this capability, our goal is to enable robots to perform one-shot learning of multi-step tasks from observation by leveraging auxiliary video data as context. Our primary contribution is a novel system that achieves this goal by: (1) using a single user-segmented demonstration to define the primitive actions that comprise a task, (2) localizing additional examples of these actions in unsegmented auxiliary videos via a metalearning-based approach, (3) using these additional examples to learn a reward function for each action, and (4) performing reinforcement learning on top of the inferred reward functions to learn action policies that can be combined to accomplish the task. We empirically demonstrate that a robot can learn multi-step tasks more effectively when provided auxiliary video, and that performance greatly improves when localizing individual actions, compared to learning from unsegmented videos.",0
"This paper presents a method for one-shot learning of multi-step tasks using auxiliary video data. Our approach uses activity localization techniques to identify relevant subtasks within each observation, allowing us to learn task representations that can generalize across different instances of the same task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for one-shot visual instruction following. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our framework beyond single-step instruction following, including complex task chaining and planning.",1
"By the widespread popularity of electronic devices, the emergence of biometric technology has brought significant convenience to user authentication compared with the traditional password and mode unlocking. Among many biological characteristics, the face is a universal and irreplaceable feature that does not need too much cooperation and can significantly improve the user's experience at the same time. Face recognition is one of the main functions of electronic equipment propaganda. Hence it's virtually worth researching in computer vision. Previous work in this field has focused on two directions: converting loss function to improve recognition accuracy in traditional deep convolution neural networks (Resnet); combining the latest loss function with the lightweight system (MobileNet) to reduce network size at the minimal expense of accuracy. But none of these has changed the network structure. With the development of AutoML, neural architecture search (NAS) has shown excellent performance in the benchmark of image classification. In this paper, we integrate NAS technology into face recognition to customize a more suitable network. We quote the framework of neural architecture search which trains child and controller network alternately. At the same time, we mutate NAS by incorporating evaluation latency into rewards of reinforcement learning and utilize policy gradient algorithm to search the architecture automatically with the most classical cross-entropy loss. The network architectures we searched out have got state-of-the-art accuracy in the large-scale face dataset, which achieves 98.77% top-1 in MS-Celeb-1M and 99.89% in LFW with relatively small network size. To the best of our knowledge, this proposal is the first attempt to use NAS to solve the problem of Deep Face Recognition and achieve the best results in this domain.",0
"In recent years deep learning has shown promising results on many tasks including image classification, object detection and speech recognition. However face verification accuracy hasn’t seen the same performance increase as other task areas despite having more data available. One reason for this is that designing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architecture requires extensive expert knowledge which might result in suboptimal architectures. Thus there is need for automating neural network architecture search (ANN). Most current work focuses on cell level searches such as DARTS but their scalability is limited by computational resources. To alleviate this we present NASFACENET, a novel approach to ANNS for deep face recognition. Our contributions includes: evaluating popular cell operations such as separable convolution, normalization cells, group normalization; presenting our novel search space based on those findings; introducing two new components: dynamic filter generation at the early stages and later fusion block which provides direct competition among features from different backbones during late stage. On LFW benchmark using CASIA webface dataset our method outperformed state of art on rank1 accuracy by +2.4% and achieved mAP score improvement up to 6%. We also showed robustness against large poses and occlusions on MegaFace Challenge dataset by performing better than published baseline models trained on clean images only. To our best knowledge this is first time anyone has used GluonCV framework to achieve top ranking model across all metrics in both datasets. As demonstrated our proposed search algorithm effectively learns good quality architectures without any heuristics applied while still allowing manual intervention through human priors and regularizer terms.",1
"Supervised learning is widely used in training autonomous driving vehicle. However, it is trained with large amount of supervised labeled data. Reinforcement learning can be trained without abundant labeled data, but we cannot train it in reality because it would involve many unpredictable accidents. Nevertheless, training an agent with good performance in virtual environment is relatively much easier. Because of the huge difference between virtual and real, how to fill the gap between virtual and real is challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework of reinforcement learning with image semantic segmentation network to make the whole model adaptable to reality. The agent is trained in TORCS, a car racing simulator.",0
"Abstract: Despite significant advances in autonomous driving research over the past decade, there remains a gap between theoretical performance and real-world implementation due to challenges such as varying road conditions, complex traffic scenarios, and dynamic environments. Recent progress has been made through the use of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that enable vehicles to adaptively learn from their environment through trial and error. RL algorithms can generate efficient policies by leveraging large amounts of data collected from sensors such as cameras and lidars, but translating these raw sensor signals into meaningful features for training purposes still poses a challenge. In this study, we propose using image translation methods to enhance the quality of the translated images before feeding them into the RL algorithm. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate improved policy stability, coverage, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our findings pave the way for more advanced RL-based autonomy systems capable of handling diverse and uncertain environments, thus closing the gap between theory and practice.",1
"Rather than proposing a new method, this paper investigates an issue present in existing learning algorithms. We study the learning dynamics of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically a characteristic coupling between learning and data generation that arises because RL agents control their future data distribution. In the presence of function approximation, this coupling can lead to a problematic type of 'ray interference', characterized by learning dynamics that sequentially traverse a number of performance plateaus, effectively constraining the agent to learn one thing at a time even when learning in parallel is better. We establish the conditions under which ray interference occurs, show its relation to saddle points and obtain the exact learning dynamics in a restricted setting. We characterize a number of its properties and discuss possible remedies.",0
"Ray interference occurs in deep reinforcement learning when multiple rays converge at a single state/action pair and cause instability in policy gradients during backpropagation through time (BPTT). This phenomenon can lead to plateaus in training performance, making it difficult for agents to learn optimal policies. We investigate the causes and implications of ray interference in deep RL, and propose mitigation strategies that could alleviate its effects on training stability and performance. Our findings suggest that careful design choices regarding architecture, parameterization, and hyperparameters can significantly reduce the impact of ray interference, improving both training efficiency and overall model quality. These results have important implications for future research in deep RL, as well as potential applications in areas such as robotics and computer vision.",1
"We propose a method to incrementally learn an embedding space over the domain of network architectures, to enable the careful selection of architectures for evaluation during compressed architecture search. Given a teacher network, we search for a compressed network architecture by using Bayesian Optimization (BO) with a kernel function defined over our proposed embedding space to select architectures for evaluation. We demonstrate that our search algorithm can significantly outperform various baseline methods, such as random search and reinforcement learning (Ashok et al., 2018). The compressed architectures found by our method are also better than the state-of-the-art manually-designed compact architecture ShuffleNet (Zhang et al., 2018). We also demonstrate that the learned embedding space can be transferred to new settings for architecture search, such as a larger teacher network or a teacher network in a different architecture family, without any training.

"Artificial neural networks have shown tremendous success in various tasks, ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. However, designing efficient neural architectures that can achieve state-of-the-art results remains challenging due to their high complexity and vast parameter spaces. One approach to address this challenge is through embedding space compression techniques that reduce the size of neural models without compromising accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel learnable embedding space method for compressing deep neural architecture parameters. We demonstrate how this approach can effectively reduce the model size while preserving performance on popular benchmark datasets across different domains. Our experimental evaluations show significant improvement over existing methods in terms of both storage requirements and inference speed. Overall, our findings highlight the potential benefits of using learnable embeddings spaces for efficiently reducing the computational burden of modern neural network models.",1
"Learning to take actions based on observations is a core requirement for artificial agents to be able to be successful and robust at their task. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies. However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient. In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem. We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.",0
"This study presents a novel approach to policy selection based on Bayesian inference through active learning. We propose that agents can improve their decision making by actively seeking out new evidence to update their beliefs about the world. By integrating active inference principles into Bayesian reasoning, we demonstrate how agents can learn more efficiently and effectively. Through simulations and experiments, our results show that this method significantly enhances agent performance compared to traditional passive methods. Our findings have important implications for artificial intelligence research as well as psychology and neuroscience.",1
"Opioids are the preferred medications for the treatment of pain in the intensive care unit. While undertreatment leads to unrelieved pain and poor clinical outcomes, excessive use of opioids puts patients at risk of experiencing multiple adverse effects. In this work, we present a sequential decision making framework for opioid dosing based on deep reinforcement learning. It provides real-time clinically interpretable dosing recommendations, personalized according to each patient's evolving pain and physiological condition. We focus on morphine, one of the most commonly prescribed opioids. To train and evaluate the model, we used retrospective data from the publicly available MIMIC-3 database. Our results demonstrate that reinforcement learning may be used to aid decision making in the intensive care setting by providing personalized pain management interventions.",0
"In recent years deep learning techniques have become increasingly popular in healthcare applications due to their ability to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data. One such application is critical care pain management where effective pain relief is crucial for patient recovery. Opioids like morphine are commonly used for intravenous (IV) administration, but pose significant risks of overdose, respiratory depression, sedation, and addiction if not titrated carefully. This study presents a novel approach to personalized IV morphine dosage titration based on dual deep reinforcement learning algorithms that adjust infusion rates according to both patient pain levels and adverse effects, maximizing analgesia while minimizing complications. Our method uses dueling double-deep Q networks (DQN), which incorporate two streams of experience replay – one focused exclusively on reward prediction errors from successful policy updates, accelerating training convergence and stability compared to standard single DQN architectures. We evaluated our approach by comparing simulated agent performance against clinically validated protocols on 24 virtual patients with variable comorbidities and response sensitivities. Agent strategies achieved significantly better pain scores, reduced opioid consumption, fewer incidents of oversedation/hypoventilation, and increased treatment satisfaction metrics compared to current standards of care across diverse scenarios. Our results suggest considerable potential benefits could arise through integration of artificial intelligence-driven decision support tools into real-time ICU settings, improving quality outcomes via safe and efficient use of potent narcotics, as well as reducing human cognitive biases potentially associated wi",1
"Machine learning has been widely applied to various applications, some of which involve training with privacy-sensitive data. A modest number of data breaches have been studied, including credit card information in natural language data and identities from face dataset. However, most of these studies focus on supervised learning models. As deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been deployed in a number of real-world systems, such as indoor robot navigation, whether trained DRL policies can leak private information requires in-depth study. To explore such privacy breaches in general, we mainly propose two methods: environment dynamics search via genetic algorithm and candidate inference based on shadow policies. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate such privacy vulnerabilities in DRL under various settings. We leverage the proposed algorithms to infer floor plans from some trained Grid World navigation DRL agents with LiDAR perception. The proposed algorithm can correctly infer most of the floor plans and reaches an average recovery rate of 95.83% using policy gradient trained agents. In addition, we are able to recover the robot configuration in continuous control environments and an autonomous driving simulator with high accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate privacy leakage in DRL settings and we show that DRL-based agents do potentially leak privacy-sensitive information from the trained policies.",0
"This research presents a new method for performing privacy attacks on deep reinforcement learning models by analyzing their actions alone. Our approach uses an efficient neural network architecture that is trained on action sequences from both successful and unsuccessful attempts at completing tasks. By comparing these two types of sequences, our model can accurately detect whether specific states correspond to a private state, such as a user's location or identity, without access to any additional context or information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack using several well-known deep reinforcement learning algorithms on real-world datasets. Additionally, we provide guidelines for mitigating the risk of these types of privacy attacks through careful consideration of the structure of the training data and task design. Overall, our work highlights the need for continued attention to privacy concerns in machine learning applications and underscores the importance of developing methods for protecting sensitive information during both training and deployment.",1
"This paper presents a novel approach to synthesize automatically age-progressed facial images in video sequences using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The proposed method models facial structures and the longitudinal face-aging process of given subjects coherently across video frames. The approach is optimized using a long-term reward, Reinforcement Learning function with deep feature extraction from Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Unlike previous age-progression methods that are only able to synthesize an aged likeness of a face from a single input image, the proposed approach is capable of age-progressing facial likenesses in videos with consistently synthesized facial features across frames. In addition, the deep reinforcement learning method guarantees preservation of the visual identity of input faces after age-progression. Results on videos of our new collected aging face AGFW-v2 database demonstrate the advantages of the proposed solution in terms of both quality of age-progressed faces, temporal smoothness, and cross-age face verification.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to automatic face aging in videos using deep reinforcement learning. Previous methods have relied on handcrafted features and rule-based systems which often lack robustness and generalization across different datasets. In contrast, our proposed method uses a deep neural network that learns to age faces by interacting with an environment modelled as a Markov decision process. We use a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the neural network's parameters over time. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in terms of visual quality and realism while also achieving faster inference speed. These findings have important implications for various applications such as video surveillance, digital entertainment, and medical diagnosis. Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision and offers a promising direction towards more advanced artificial intelligence.",1
"In this paper, we point out a fundamental property of the objective in reinforcement learning, with which we can reformulate the policy gradient objective into a perceptron-like loss function, removing the need to distinguish between on and off policy training. Namely, we posit that it is sufficient to only update a policy $\pi$ for cases that satisfy the condition $A(\frac{\pi}{\mu}-1)\leq0$, where $A$ is the advantage, and $\mu$ is another policy. Furthermore, we show via theoretic derivation that a perceptron-like loss function matches the clipped surrogate objective for PPO. With our new formulation, the policies $\pi$ and $\mu$ can be arbitrarily apart in theory, effectively enabling off-policy training. To examine our derivations, we can combine the on-policy PPO clipped surrogate (which we show to be equivalent with one instance of the new reformation) with the off-policy IMPALA method. We first verify the combined method on the OpenAI Gym pendulum toy problem. Next, we use our method to train a quadrotor position controller in a simulator. Our trained policy is efficient and lightweight enough to perform in a low cost micro-controller at a minimum update rate of 500 Hz. For the quadrotor, we show two experiments to verify our method and demonstrate performance: 1) hovering at a fixed position, and 2) tracking along a specific trajectory. In preliminary trials, we are also able to apply the method to a real-world quadrotor.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving challenging problems in control and decision making under uncertainty. One key challenge facing researchers in this field is how to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Exploration allows agents to learn new skills and adapt to changing environments, while exploitation enables them to make effective use of their current knowledge to maximize rewards. Many algorithms have been proposed that try to strike a good balance between these two competing objectives, but none have yet achieved widespread adoption due to limitations such as high sample complexity, instability, or poor generalization across tasks. This paper proposes several novel approaches to combining on-policy and off-policy methods based on the idea of using multiple value functions to represent different aspects of the agent’s behavior. Our approach addresses many of the shortcomings of existing methods by providing efficient exploration mechanisms and robustness across tasks, allowing us to achieve state-of-the art results in several benchmark domains. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis to support our claims and shed light on the underlying principles behind our algorithm. Overall, this work represents an important step towards bridging the gap between theory and practice in deep reinforcement learning, and demonstrates the potential of using multiple value functions to improve the performance of realworld applications.",1
"Model-free learning for multi-agent stochastic games is an active area of research. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms, however, are often restricted to zero-sum games, and are applicable only in small state-action spaces or other simplified settings. Here, we develop a new data efficient Deep-Q-learning methodology for model-free learning of Nash equilibria for general-sum stochastic games. The algorithm uses a local linear-quadratic expansion of the stochastic game, which leads to analytically solvable optimal actions. The expansion is parametrized by deep neural networks to give it sufficient flexibility to learn the environment without the need to experience all state-action pairs. We study symmetry properties of the algorithm stemming from label-invariant stochastic games and as a proof of concept, apply our algorithm to learning optimal trading strategies in competitive electronic markets.",0

"This paper addresses the scalability challenge of architecture search by formulating the task in a differentiable manner. Unlike conventional approaches of applying evolution or reinforcement learning over a discrete and non-differentiable search space, our method is based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, allowing efficient search of the architecture using gradient descent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels in discovering high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques.

Our method overcomes several limitations of existing methods such as limited scalability, reliance on predefined operators, and lack of uncertainty estimation. We demonstrate through experiments on popular benchmark datasets that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks while significantly reducing computational costs compared to handcrafted architectures designed by human experts. Furthermore, we provide insightful analyses of learned architectures to gain a better understanding of how they perform well on their respective tasks. Overall, our work presents a promising direction towards fully automating the pipeline of machine learning model development and deployment.",1
"Decomposition methods have been proposed to approximate solutions to large sequential decision making problems. In contexts where an agent interacts with multiple entities, utility decomposition can be used to separate the global objective into local tasks considering each individual entity independently. An arbitrator is then responsible for combining the individual utilities and selecting an action in real time to solve the global problem. Although these techniques can perform well empirically, they rely on strong assumptions of independence between the local tasks and sacrifice the optimality of the global solution. This paper proposes an approach that improves upon such approximate solutions by learning a correction term represented by a neural network. We demonstrate this approach on a fisheries management problem where multiple boats must coordinate to maximize their catch over time as well as on a pedestrian avoidance problem for autonomous driving. In each problem, decomposition methods can scale to multiple boats or pedestrians by using strategies involving one entity. We verify empirically that the proposed correction method significantly improves the decomposition method and outperforms a policy trained on the full scale problem without utility decomposition.",0
"In this article we propose two new methods for decomposing complex reinforcement learning problems into simpler subproblems that can then be solved more easily. We first discuss the basic idea behind decomposition methods, which involves breaking down a difficult problem into smaller and easier tasks that can each be solved separately. Our proposed method builds on this foundation by adding deep neural networks as well as specialized learning algorithms to improve performance. These deep neural nets learn representations of state actions pairs that can better capture the true dynamics underlying our domains. Furthermore, these learned representations enable us to correct any errors made during the decomposition process using additional algorithms tailored specifically for correction. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we provide comparisons against prior art in terms of sample efficiency and final rewards achieved across multiple challenging environments.",1
"Abstracting complex 3D shapes with parsimonious part-based representations has been a long standing goal in computer vision. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this problem which goes beyond the traditional 3D cuboid representation by exploiting superquadrics as atomic elements. We demonstrate that superquadrics lead to more expressive 3D scene parses while being easier to learn than 3D cuboid representations. Moreover, we provide an analytical solution to the Chamfer loss which avoids the need for computational expensive reinforcement learning or iterative prediction. Our model learns to parse 3D objects into consistent superquadric representations without supervision. Results on various ShapeNet categories as well as the SURREAL human body dataset demonstrate the flexibility of our model in capturing fine details and complex poses that could not have been modelled using cuboids.",0
"Shape parsing has been a fundamental task in computer vision and graphics for decades, where the goal is to predict 2D shapes from images. However, extending shape parsing into the third dimension remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of real world scenes and object geometries. In recent years, superquadric modeling has emerged as one of the most widely used methods for representing and approximating curved surfaces, but traditional approaches still rely heavily on cubic primitives such as cubes, spheres, and cylinders, which can lead to imprecise representations of complex objects. This paper presents a novel approach to 3D shape parsing using learning techniques that go beyond simple cube-based representation models. We propose a deep neural network architecture that learns to directly map input images into point cloud representations that encode detailed geometric features, including fine scale curvature, silhouette contours, surface normal vectors, and texture maps. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach for accurate 3D shape prediction in the wild.",1
"Power system emergency control is generally regarded as the last safety net for grid security and resiliency. Existing emergency control schemes are usually designed off-line based on either the conceived ""worst"" case scenario or a few typical operation scenarios. These schemes are facing significant adaptiveness and robustness issues as increasing uncertainties and variations occur in modern electrical grids. To address these challenges, for the first time, this paper developed novel adaptive emergency control schemes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), by leveraging the high-dimensional feature extraction and non-linear generalization capabilities of DRL for complex power systems. Furthermore, an open-source platform named RLGC has been designed for the first time to assist the development and benchmarking of DRL algorithms for power system control. Details of the platform and DRL-based emergency control schemes for generator dynamic braking and under-voltage load shedding are presented. Extensive case studies performed in both two-area four-machine system and IEEE 39-Bus system have demonstrated the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed schemes.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex decision making problems in real-world applications such as control systems. This study presents a novel application of DRL in adaptive power system emergency control, which involves dealing with unpredictable events that may disrupt normal operation of electric grids. Traditional grid protection schemes rely on predefined static rules and cannot adapt effectively to rapidly changing scenarios. By contrast, our proposed method utilizes a state-of-the-art model-free deep Q-network algorithm to learn optimal responses to unexpected disturbances and ensure stable operation while minimizing negative impacts on customers. Our results show significant improvements over conventional methods in terms of stability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction under different contingencies. Overall, we demonstrate the great potential of applying advanced machine learning techniques to enhance resilience and reliability of modern power systems.",1
"How much does having visual priors about the world (e.g. the fact that the world is 3D) assist in learning to perform downstream motor tasks (e.g. delivering a package)? We study this question by integrating a generic perceptual skill set (e.g. a distance estimator, an edge detector, etc.) within a reinforcement learning framework--see Figure 1. This skill set (hereafter mid-level perception) provides the policy with a more processed state of the world compared to raw images.   We find that using a mid-level perception confers significant advantages over training end-to-end from scratch (i.e. not leveraging priors) in navigation-oriented tasks. Agents are able to generalize to situations where the from-scratch approach fails and training becomes significantly more sample efficient. However, we show that realizing these gains requires careful selection of the mid-level perceptual skills. Therefore, we refine our findings into an efficient max-coverage feature set that can be adopted in lieu of raw images. We perform our study in completely separate buildings for training and testing and compare against visually blind baseline policies and state-of-the-art feature learning methods.",0
"Visual representations learned by agents that operate in complex environments play an essential role in learning generalizable visuomotor policies. One key challenge in representation learning is designing representations that improve both generalization across environments and sample efficiency during training. In recent work, mid-level visual representations have been proposed as effective features for transferring knowledge from source tasks to target domains in reinforcement learning (RL). These representations capture high-level contextual relationships within scenes and can simplify problem complexity while preserving most important details. However, less attention has been given to applying these representations explicitly as part of RL algorithms operating directly on raw sensory inputs. This paper investigates whether incorporating mid-level representations into RL frameworks can further enhance performance across several challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks. Our findings show improvements in terms of faster convergence rates and increased robustness to variations in scene configurations across different environments compared to using raw pixel observations or lower-level feature extractors alone. While there remains ample room for further advancements in leveraging such representations for improved performance, our study represents a step towards broader adoption of these techniques in real-world applications where data collection may remain constrained.",1
"An important facet of reinforcement learning (RL) has to do with how the agent goes about exploring the environment. Traditional exploration strategies typically focus on efficiency and ignore safety. However, for practical applications, ensuring safety of the agent during exploration is crucial since performing an unsafe action or reaching an unsafe state could result in irreversible damage to the agent. The main challenge of safe exploration is that characterizing the unsafe states and actions is difficult for large continuous state or action spaces and unknown environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to incorporate estimations of safety to guide exploration and policy search in deep reinforcement learning. By using a cost function to capture trajectory-based safety, our key idea is to formulate the state-action value function of this safety cost as a candidate Lyapunov function and extend control-theoretic results to approximate its derivative using online Gaussian Process (GP) estimation. We show how to use these statistical models to guide the agent in unknown environments to obtain high-performance control policies with provable stability certificates.",0
"Title: ""Online Gaussian Process Estimation for Safe Reinforcement Learning""  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently emerged as a powerful framework for solving complex control problems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, game playing, and other domains. One key challenge in applying DRL methods to safety-critical systems is ensuring that the learned behavior of the agent remains within safe operating limits. In this work, we present an online estimation method based on Gaussian processes to estimate the uncertain dynamics of the system under exploration by the DRL algorithm. We then use these estimates to guide the policy update during training towards safer actions without sacrificing performance. Our approach enables efficient model selection through online adaptive inference and can handle high-dimensional state spaces encountered in real-world applications. Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements in both safety and overall performance compared to baseline DRL algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method in enabling safe exploration and decision making.",1
"In decision making problems for continuous state and action spaces, linear dynamical models are widely employed. Specifically, policies for stochastic linear systems subject to quadratic cost functions capture a large number of applications in reinforcement learning. Selected randomized policies have been studied in the literature recently that address the trade-off between identification and control. However, little is known about policies based on bootstrapping observed states and actions. In this work, we show that bootstrap-based policies achieve a square root scaling of regret with respect to time. We also obtain results on the accuracy of learning the model's dynamics. Corroborative numerical analysis that illustrates the technical results is also provided.",0
"The abstract should begin by introducing the topic of continuous space reinforcement learning (RL), followed by motivation behind using Bootstrap methods in RL applications. Then describe how Bootstrap can help improve sample efficiency in deep RL, provide empirical results from simulations and experiments conducted on standard continuous control tasks such as MuJoCo locomotion problems that demonstrate improvement over state of art DDPG baseline. Finally end with conclusion on future directions in improving sample efficiency through bootstrapping techniques applied in deep RL algorithms such as TD3 etc. ------ Hi there! I was looking into using bootstrap in my machine learning project, but couldn't find any articles directly related to my task so far. What would you recommend? -------- Thanks for your question. Can you tell me more about your machine learning project, specifically what type of problem you are trying to solve and which ML algorithm(s) you plan to use? This will allow me to give better recommendations on whether or not bootstrap may be applicable, and if so, which bootstrap technique might be most suitable. Additionally, have you considered other regularization techniques besides bootstrap, such as dropout or early stopping? These could potentially also help improve model performance.",1
"Deep neural networks have become commonplace in the domain of reinforcement learning, but are often expensive in terms of the number of parameters needed. While compressing deep neural networks has of late assumed great importance to overcome this drawback, little work has been done to address this problem in the context of reinforcement learning agents. This work aims at making first steps towards model compression in an RL agent. In particular, we compress networks to drastically reduce the number of parameters in them (to sizes less than 3% of their original size), further facilitated by applying a global max pool after the final convolution layer, and propose using Actor-Mimic in the context of compression. Finally, we show that this global max-pool allows for weakly supervised object localization, improving the ability to identify the agent's points of focus.",0
"This article presents a novel algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) on Atari games that combines model compression techniques with localization methods to improve performance and sample efficiency. The proposed method uses deep Q-learning, where actions are selected based on their corresponding values under a learned stochastic policy. A neural network is trained from scratch as an approximation of the action value function, which takes state vectors as input and outputs expected long-term reward. To reduce computational requirements and memory usage, we use pruning techniques during training to gradually remove unimportant weights and connections from the network. Pruned networks have fewer parameters than original ones, resulting in faster inference speed while maintaining similar accuracy. Model quantization further reduces storage size by representing weights using low precision integers. We then adopt a form of selfplay using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), introducing a variant called Recurrent Self Play Lead to Death (RSPLD). RSPLD improves sample efficiency by terminating random playouts early if they are unlikely to lead to desired results. In addition, our approach incorporates a domain decomposition strategy called Neural Environment Localization (NEL), which adjusts the probability distribution used for exploration based on current beliefs about the environment. NEL increases exploitation rates by directing agents towards regions where rewards are more predictable. Results show significant improvements over previous algorithms in terms of final scores and average return across multiple environments, making our approach well suited for real-world applications with limited computing resources. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of combining model compression techniques with localization methods to advance the field of RL for complex problems.",1
"Boltzmann exploration is widely used in reinforcement learning to provide a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Recently, in (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2017) it has been shown that pure Boltzmann exploration does not perform well from a regret perspective, even in the simplest setting of stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems. In this paper, we show that a simple modification to Boltzmann exploration, motivated by a variation of the standard doubling trick, achieves $O(K\log^{1+\alpha} T)$ regret for a stochastic MAB problem with $K$ arms, where $\alpha0$ is a parameter of the algorithm. This improves on the result in (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2017), where an algorithm inspired by the Gumbel-softmax trick achieves $O(K\log^2 T)$ regret. We also show that our algorithm achieves $O(\beta(G) \log^{1+\alpha} T)$ regret in stochastic MAB problems with graph-structured feedback, without knowledge of the graph structure, where $\beta(G)$ is the independence number of the feedback graph. Additionally, we present extensive experimental results on real datasets and applications for multi-armed bandits with both traditional bandit feedback and graph-structured feedback. In all cases, our algorithm performs as well or better than the state-of-the-art.",0
"This can lead reviewers astray if they happen upon an abstract before deciding whether your submission would belong at their workshop or conference! Abstract: Here is an example of how you could write such an abstract.  ""Boltzmann exploration is an algorithm that allows intelligent agents, both real or artificial, to make optimal use of resources. However, many natural phenomena can only be described statistically rather than deterministically, which means we need a different model of decision making based on statistics instead of determinism. In this paper I present a new approach called ""Almost Boltzmann Exploration"", which uses statistical methods as well as traditional methods like backpropagation to find good solutions even under conditions of uncertainty.""",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) agents optimize only the features specified in a reward function and are indifferent to anything left out inadvertently. This means that we must not only specify what to do, but also the much larger space of what not to do. It is easy to forget these preferences, since these preferences are already satisfied in our environment. This motivates our key insight: when a robot is deployed in an environment that humans act in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want. We can therefore use this implicit preference information from the state to fill in the blanks. We develop an algorithm based on Maximum Causal Entropy IRL and use it to evaluate the idea in a suite of proof-of-concept environments designed to show its properties. We find that information from the initial state can be used to infer both side effects that should be avoided as well as preferences for how the environment should be organized. Our code can be found at https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/rlsp.",0
"Title:Preferences Implicit in the State of the World Abstract:Human preferences are often complex and difficult to fully articulate or quantify. This can make it challenging to model human behavior accurately in a variety of fields including economics, psychology, and machine learning. However, recent advances have allowed researchers to analyze data on how individuals interact with their environment and draw inferences about their underlying preferences based on these interactions. In this paper, we propose that studying the current state of the world provides insights into implicit human preferences, as the state of the world represents the outcome of countless individual decisions and actions. We explore the implications of this idea using case studies from a range of domains, demonstrating the potential value of this approach for understanding and predicting human behavior. Our findings highlight the utility of considering the state of the world as a source of information about human preferences and provide guidance for future work in this area.",1
"Within Reinforcement Learning, there is a growing collection of research which aims to express all of an agent's knowledge of the world through predictions about sensation, behaviour, and time. This work can be seen not only as a collection of architectural proposals, but also as the beginnings of a theory of machine knowledge in reinforcement learning. Recent work has expanded what can be expressed using predictions, and developed applications which use predictions to inform decision-making on a variety of synthetic and real-world problems. While promising, we here suggest that the notion of predictions as knowledge in reinforcement learning is as yet underdeveloped: some work explicitly refers to predictions as knowledge, what the requirements are for considering a prediction to be knowledge have yet to be well explored. This specification of the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge is important; even if claims about the nature of knowledge are left implicit in technical proposals, the underlying assumptions of such claims have consequences for the systems we design. These consequences manifest in both the way we choose to structure predictive knowledge architectures, and how we evaluate them. In this paper, we take a first step to formalizing predictive knowledge by discussing the relationship of predictive knowledge learning methods to existing theories of knowledge in epistemology. Specifically, we explore the relationships between Generalized Value Functions and epistemic notions of Justification and Truth.",0
"This paper investigates how people decide whether or not something counts as knowledge in everyday situations. We focus on predictions because they pose interesting cases where some aspects of knowledge can seemingly apply even though there might be no actual knowledge involved. In our studies, participants read descriptions of scenarios involving prediction—such as predicting that one’s team will win based on past performance statistics. They then judged whether these actions were done “based on knowledge.” Our results show that people often attribute “knowledge” to successful predictions while denying such attributions in other similar but less successful or ambiguous cases. This provides insights into important ways we implicitly judge knowledge claims and has implications for philosophical theories of knowledge as well as applied domains like artificial intelligence.

"We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodology to bypass Google reCAPTCHA v3. We formulate the problem as a grid world where the agent learns how to move the mouse and click on the reCAPTCHA button to receive a high score. We study the performance of the agent when we vary the cell size of the grid world and show that the performance drops when the agent takes big steps toward the goal. Finally, we used a divide and conquer strategy to defeat the reCAPTCHA system for any grid resolution. Our proposed method achieves a success rate of 97.4% on a 100x100 grid and 96.7% on a 1000x1000 screen resolution.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to hacking Google reCAPTCHA version 3 (v3) using reinforcement learning techniques.

Our method leverages a convolutional neural network trained on a dataset of annotated images to predict the correct response to the reCAPTCHA challenge. By optimizing both our model architecture and training process through a continuous reinforcement loop, we achieved an accuracy rate above 90% across multiple domains. In addition to describing our methodology, we provide insights into the challenges encountered during development and discuss potential mitigations that could make future versions of reCAPTCHA more robust against automated attacks. Finally, we highlight the broader implications of our findings on reCAPTCHA security and their impact on online applications and services.",1
"Optimism about the poorly understood states and actions is the main driving force of exploration for many provably-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms. We propose optimism in the face of sensible value functions (OFVF)- a novel data-driven Bayesian algorithm to constructing Plausibility sets for MDPs to explore robustly minimizing the worst case exploration cost. The method computes policies with tighter optimistic estimates for exploration by introducing two new ideas. First, it is based on Bayesian posterior distributions rather than distribution-free bounds. Second, OFVF does not construct plausibility sets as simple confidence intervals. Confidence intervals as plausibility sets are a sufficient but not a necessary condition. OFVF uses the structure of the value function to optimize the location and shape of the plausibility set to guarantee upper bounds directly without necessarily enforcing the requirement for the set to be a confidence interval. OFVF proceeds in an episodic manner, where the duration of the episode is fixed and known. Our algorithm is inherently Bayesian and can leverage prior information. Our theoretical analysis shows the robustness of OFVF, and the empirical results demonstrate its practical promise.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing methods that can efficiently explore complex search spaces while ensuring robustness to uncertainty in the problem definition. One approach that has gained popularity is the use of Bayesian optimization, which iteratively builds a probabilistic model of the objective function using Gaussian processes. However, existing approaches often rely on loose bounds to define the feasible region of the search space, which may result in suboptimal solutions or even failure to converge. This paper presents a novel framework called ""Tight Bayesian Plausibility Sets"" (TBPS) that tightens these bounds by incorporating prior knowledge about constraints and the distribution of the unknown variables into the posterior distribution over possible objectives. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world problems that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency while maintaining strong guarantees of feasibility and optimality. Our work shows that by combining domain expertise and statistical models, we can develop more efficient exploration strategies that better capture the structure of complex systems and lead to superior decision making.",1
"Efficient exploration is one of the key challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most traditional sample efficiency bounds require strategic exploration. Recently many deep RL algorithms with simple heuristic exploration strategies that have few formal guarantees, achieve surprising success in many domains. These results pose an important question about understanding these exploration strategies such as $e$-greedy, as well as understanding what characterize the difficulty of exploration in MDPs. In this work we propose problem specific sample complexity bounds of $Q$ learning with random walk exploration that rely on several structural properties. We also link our theoretical results to some empirical benchmark domains, to illustrate if our bound gives polynomial sample complexity in these domains and how that is related with the empirical performance.",0
"In our world, exploring more helps us learn faster. There are algorithms that can perform very well even if they explore only slightly better than random chance alone! Our results show simple methods are surprisingly powerful, but there is one key condition we need in order to make these work as advertised. When exploration improves by just enough over randomness, then learning performance skyrockets without any tuning at all. This turns out to depend on some conditions that sound like common sense, so that's nice—no tricks here. While more complex things might not always beat simpler ones, sometimes all you need is simplicity to win big! With easy-to-check rules, researchers will know how far to trust these simplified exploratory algorithms without wasting time testing them fully. So whether you think simple ideas deserve a second look or want to apply great new techniques to real problems today, read on for all the details behind this exciting breakthrough. (We're pretty proud!)  ----- In this paper, we consider whether Random Exploration in reinforcement learning is sufficient for efficient sample complexity, i.e., achieving good accuracy while using few data points. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for ""simple"" exploration strategies to yield provably correct PAC Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms under standard assumptions about Markov decision processes (MDPs). Specifically, we find that the ability to achieve sufficient improvement over pure random exploration depends crucially on properties such as controllability and smoothness of the MDP dynamics. These conditions may appear unsurprising in retrospect, yet their verification remains essential, both for theoretical analysis and in practice; indeed, verifying them is computationally straightforward. Moreover, since purely heuristically motivated alternatives are typically much harder to analyze theoretically or verify practicall",1
"This paper addresses the problem of learning the optimal control policy for a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system with continuous state space, continuous action space and unknown dynamics. This class of problems are typically addressed in stochastic adaptive control and reinforcement learning literature using model-based and model-free approaches respectively. Both methods rely on solving a dynamic programming problem, either directly or indirectly, for finding the optimal closed loop control policy. The inherent `curse of dimensionality' associated with dynamic programming method makes these approaches also computationally difficult.   This paper proposes a novel decoupled data-based control (D2C) algorithm that addresses this problem using a decoupled, `open loop - closed loop', approach. First, an open-loop deterministic trajectory optimization problem is solved using a black-box simulation model of the dynamical system. Then, a closed loop control is developed around this open loop trajectory by linearization of the dynamics about this nominal trajectory. By virtue of linearization, a linear quadratic regulator based algorithm can be used for this closed loop control. We show that the performance of D2C algorithm is approximately optimal. Moreover, simulation performance suggests significant reduction in training time compared to other state of the art algorithms.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for learning to control nonlinear dynamical systems using decoupled data based approach. Traditional approaches to controlling complex systems often struggle with identifying the most relevant features that drive system behavior, which can lead to suboptimal performance or even instability. In contrast, our proposed method uses machine learning algorithms to learn the essential dynamics of the system from raw sensory data, without relying on domain knowledge or handcrafted features. By combining state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques with powerful deep neural network architectures, we show how these learned dynamics can be used to generate optimal control policies that maximize desired objectives while minimizing unwanted behaviors. We evaluate our method through extensive simulations across various benchmark problems, demonstrating its ability to outperform traditional model-based controllers as well as other data-driven methods that rely on handcrafted features. Our results suggest significant potential for this new approach to improve the efficiency, robustness, and adaptability of real-world cyber-physical systems.",1
"We study the multi-round response generation in visual dialog, where a response is generated according to a visually grounded conversational history. Given a triplet: an image, Q&A history, and current question, all the prevailing methods follow a codec (i.e., encoder-decoder) fashion in a supervised learning paradigm: a multimodal encoder encodes the triplet into a feature vector, which is then fed into the decoder for the current answer generation, supervised by the ground-truth. However, this conventional supervised learning does NOT take into account the impact of imperfect history, violating the conversational nature of visual dialog and thus making the codec more inclined to learn history bias but not contextual reasoning. To this end, inspired by the actor-critic policy gradient in reinforcement learning, we propose a novel training paradigm called History Advantage Sequence Training (HAST). Specifically, we intentionally impose wrong answers in the history, obtaining an adverse critic, and see how the historic error impacts the codec's future behavior by History Advantage-a quantity obtained by subtracting the adverse critic from the gold reward of ground-truth history. Moreover, to make the codec more sensitive to the history, we propose a novel attention network called History-Aware Co-Attention Network (HACAN) which can be effectively trained by using HAST. Experimental results on three benchmarks: VisDial v0.9&v1.0 and GuessWhat?!, show that the proposed HAST strategy consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised counterparts.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can perform tasks such as image description generation and visual question answering. One approach that has shown promising results is history advantage sequence training (HAST). HAST involves using historical context from previous interactions with users to inform future responses. However, most current implementations of HAST focus on language models trained specifically for natural language processing tasks. This paper proposes a novel application of HAST to the domain of visual dialogue. Our method allows a machine learning model to learn a representation of human behavior, allowing the model to better predict the user intent and provide more accurate responses. We evaluate our approach through experiments comparing two different types of representations, one based purely on natural language text and another enriched with additional context provided by the agent itself, including both human annotations and a lightweight gaze estimation system. Results show that incorporating gaze information significantly improves performance compared to relying solely on NL data. Furthermore, we analyze some examples where agents failed, which provides insights into how future versions could be improved. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining HAST with vision-based task-oriented dialogue systems, suggesting potential applications beyond just single conversational turn settings.",1
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms allow artificial agents to improve their action selections so as to increase rewarding experiences in their environments. Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms require solving a nonconvex and nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem. Methods for solving the optimization problems in deep RL are restricted to the class of first-order algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The major drawback of the SGD methods is that they have the undesirable effect of not escaping saddle points and their performance can be seriously obstructed by ill-conditioning. Furthermore, SGD methods require exhaustive trial and error to fine-tune many learning parameters. Using second derivative information can result in improved convergence properties, but computing the Hessian matrix for large-scale problems is not practical. Quasi-Newton methods require only first-order gradient information, like SGD, but they can construct a low rank approximation of the Hessian matrix and result in superlinear convergence. The limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) approach is one of the most popular quasi-Newton methods that construct positive definite Hessian approximations. In this paper, we introduce an efficient optimization method, based on the limited memory BFGS quasi-Newton method using line search strategy -- as an alternative to SGD methods. Our method bridges the disparity between first order methods and second order methods by continuing to use gradient information to calculate a low-rank Hessian approximations. We provide formal convergence analysis as well as empirical results on a subset of the classic ATARI 2600 games. Our results show a robust convergence with preferred generalization characteristics, as well as fast training time and no need for the experience replaying mechanism.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex sequential decision making problems across diverse domains such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving.

These algorithms can become computationally expensive especially in high dimensional state spaces which makes them intractable for real world applications. To tackle these issues, we present a novel algorithm that uses second order optimization method L-BFGS for optimizing the value function in DQL agent. Our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of iterations required to converge by adapting the curvature information provided by L-BFGS. We showcase our algorithm's effectiveness by comparing its performance against state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark tasks such as cartpole and mountain car while achieving better results at a lower computational cost.

"In recent times, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models have gained a lot of popularity and provide state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of tasks such as machine translation, headline generation, text summarization, speech to text conversion, and image caption generation. The underlying framework for all these models is usually a deep neural network comprising an encoder and a decoder. Although simple encoder-decoder models produce competitive results, many researchers have proposed additional improvements over these sequence-to-sequence models, e.g., using an attention-based model over the input, pointer-generation models, and self-attention models. However, such seq2seq models suffer from two common problems: 1) exposure bias and 2) inconsistency between train/test measurement. Recently, a completely novel point of view has emerged in addressing these two problems in seq2seq models, leveraging methods from reinforcement learning (RL). In this survey, we consider seq2seq problems from the RL point of view and provide a formulation combining the power of RL methods in decision-making with sequence-to-sequence models that enable remembering long-term memories. We present some of the most recent frameworks that combine concepts from RL and deep neural networks and explain how these two areas could benefit from each other in solving complex seq2seq tasks.

"When watching omnidirectional images (ODIs), subjects can access different viewports by moving their heads. Therefore, it is necessary to predict subjects' head fixations on ODIs. Inspired by generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), this paper proposes a novel approach to predict saliency of head fixations on ODIs, named SalGAIL. First, we establish a dataset for attention on ODIs (AOI). In contrast to traditional datasets, our AOI dataset is large-scale, which contains the head fixations of 30 subjects viewing 600 ODIs. Next, we mine our AOI dataset and determine three findings: (1) The consistency of head fixations are consistent among subjects, and it grows alongside the increased subject number; (2) The head fixations exist with a front center bias (FCB); and (3) The magnitude of head movement is similar across subjects. According to these findings, our SalGAIL approach applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to predict the head fixations of one subject, in which GAIL learns the reward of DRL, rather than the traditional human-designed reward. Then, multi-stream DRL is developed to yield the head fixations of different subjects, and the saliency map of an ODI is generated via convoluting predicted head fixations. Finally, experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting saliency maps of ODIs, significantly better than 10 state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"Image saliency prediction has been studied extensively over past years for several applications like visual attention analysis and scene understanding. However, most previous works focused only on natural images under fixed viewpoints rather than omni-directional image pairs (e.g., stereo pairs) that provide complete surroundings information crucial to autonomous robots. In this work we focus on the problem of predicting pixel-level saliency maps from omnidirectional images which could benefit robotic tasks such as navigation and obstacle detection. We propose a novel framework called generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), by leveraging both generative and discriminative models trained simultaneously through two different objectives: maximizing the performance of the generator network in predicting saliency values of ground truth saliency map and minimizing the difference between generated map and real one using GAN loss functions. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins in both subjective evaluations and objective metrics. Meanwhile, extensive ablation study demonstrates our method successfully incorporate learned knowledge into existing networks without any fine-tuning. --In summary: Image saliency prediction plays a key role in computer vision systems but limited research has been done on omnidirectional images. This study proposes a new approach - generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) - to accurately predict saliency maps from these types of images. The authors demonstrate their model significantly improves upon current methods in terms of accuracy and performance, making it suitable for use in robotics, specifically for tasks involving navigation and obstacle detection. By combining both generative and discriminative models, GAIL successfully captures important features and achieves better results overall while requiring no further training once implemented.",1
"In reinforcement learning (RL), temporal abstraction still remains as an important and unsolved problem. The options framework provided clues to temporal abstraction in the RL, and the option-critic architecture elegantly solved the two problems of finding options and learning RL agents in an end-to-end manner. However, it is necessary to examine whether the options learned through this method play a mutually exclusive role. In this paper, we propose a Hellinger distance regularizer, a method for disentangling options. In addition, we will shed light on various indicators from the statistical point of view to compare with the options learned through the existing option-critic architecture.",0
"In recent years, the problem of disentanglement has received significant attention as a key challenge in deep learning research. Successful disentanglement can lead to more interpretable and generalizable models, while failure often results in entangled representations that are difficult to reason about and lack robustness. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the use of the Hellinger distance regularizer. This method adds an additional term to the loss function during training, encouraging the model to generate outputs that minimize the Hellinger distance between adjacent time steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Our findings provide important insights into the role of disentanglement in deep learning and highlight the potential benefits of using geometric measures such as the Hellinger distance for regularization purposes. Overall, our work represents an important contribution to the field and provides new tools for future researchers to build upon.",1
"Existing methods for image captioning are usually trained by cross entropy loss, which leads to exposure bias and the inconsistency between the optimizing function and evaluation metrics. Recently it has been shown that these two issues can be addressed by incorporating techniques from reinforcement learning, where one of the popular techniques is the advantage actor-critic algorithm that calculates per-token advantage by estimating state value with a parametrized estimator at the cost of introducing estimation bias. In this paper, we estimate state value without using a parametrized value estimator. With the properties of image captioning, namely, the deterministic state transition function and the sparse reward, state value is equivalent to its preceding state-action value, and we reformulate advantage function by simply replacing the former with the latter. Moreover, the reformulated advantage is extended to n-step, which can generally increase the absolute value of the mean of reformulated advantage while lowering variance. Then two kinds of rollout are adopted to estimate state-action value, which we call self-critical n-step training. Empirically we find that our method can obtain better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods that use the sequence level advantage and parametrized estimator respectively on the widely used MSCOCO benchmark.",0
"Title: Enhancing Image Captioning through Self-Critical n-Step Training  Image captioning has become a popular research topic due to its ability to automatically generate descriptive text from images. However, existing methods still face challenges such as repetitive outputs and lack of coherence in generated descriptions. In this study, we propose a new approach called self-critical n-step training (SCNT) that addresses these issues by incorporating a self-critical mechanism into the image captioning process. Our method uses reinforcement learning to improve both the content quality and coherency of the generated texts. Specifically, SCNT learns from previous predictions to adjust future ones, ensuring each caption accurately captures all details in the input image while maintaining contextual consistency throughout the entire sequence. We evaluate our approach on two widely used datasets (MSCOCO and Flickr8K) against several baseline models and achieve significant improvements across different evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in enhancing image captioning performance. Overall, our work represents a step forward in advancing artificial intelligence technology for real-world applications that involve natural language generation from visual inputs.",1
"Contextual policy search (CPS) is a class of multi-task reinforcement learning algorithms that is particularly useful for robotic applications. A recent state-of-the-art method is Contextual Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategies (C-CMA-ES). It is based on the standard black-box optimization algorithm CMA-ES. There are two useful extensions of CMA-ES that we will transfer to C-CMA-ES and evaluate empirically: ACM-ES, which uses a comparison-based surrogate model, and aCMA-ES, which uses an active update of the covariance matrix. We will show that improvements with these methods can be impressive in terms of sample-efficiency, although this is not relevant any more for the robotic domain.",0
"This paper presents an empirical evaluation of contextual policy search methods using a comparison-based surrogate model and active covariance matrix adaptation. We investigate two specific algorithms: Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) based optimization and Kernel Expansion Modified Cross Validation (KEMCO). Our results show that both TSVD and KEMCO are effective at finding near-optimal policies in complex reinforcement learning domains. However, we found that TSVD outperforms KEMCO on most tasks due to its ability to handle larger state spaces more efficiently. Additionally, we compare our findings against other state-of-the-art algorithms and discuss potential applications of these techniques in real-world decision making problems. Overall, our work demonstrates the promise of contextual policy search as a powerful approach in RL research.",1
"End-to-end deep reinforcement learning has enabled agents to learn with little preprocessing by humans. However, it is still difficult to learn stably and efficiently because the learning method usually uses a nonlinear function approximation. Neural Episodic Control (NEC), which has been proposed in order to improve sample efficiency, is able to learn stably by estimating action values using a non-parametric method. In this paper, we propose an architecture that incorporates random projection into NEC to train with more stability. In addition, we verify the effectiveness of our architecture by Atari's five games. The main idea is to reduce the number of parameters that have to learn by replacing neural networks with random projection in order to reduce dimensions while keeping the learning end-to-end.",0
"""Random Projection in Neural Episodic Contro"" (RPNEC) is a novel method that utilizes random projections in neural episodic control tasks such as reinforcement learning problems to improve generalization performance on a wide range of benchmark environments. RPNEC combines several well-known concepts from deep learning, including recurrent layers, gating mechanisms and skip connections to efficiently handle complex sequential data. Additionally, RPNEC introduces innovative elements such as randomly projecting the state space into a low dimensional feature space which drastically reduces computational demands required by traditional deep neural network architectures while still achieving competitive results. This paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed model to perform robustly across multiple domains while presenting an efficient training process compared to current methods.""",1
"Reproducibility in reinforcement learning is challenging: uncontrolled stochasticity from many sources, such as the learning algorithm, the learned policy, and the environment itself have led researchers to report the performance of learned agents using aggregate metrics of performance over multiple random seeds for a single environment. Unfortunately, there are still pernicious sources of variability in reinforcement learning agents that make reporting common summary statistics an unsound metric for performance. Our experiments demonstrate the variability of common agents used in the popular OpenAI Baselines repository. We make the case for reporting post-training agent performance as a distribution, rather than a point estimate.",0
"This paper investigates how different parameters affect reinforcement learning agents playing video games from the classic Atari collection under several variations of randomness such as screen resolutions (from 9x9 up to full 260x196), additive noise on the pixels values, and frame skipping rates ranging up to one out of every five frames. Our results suggest that higher levels of variation tend to make learning more difficult but can ultimately lead to better agent performance once learned. We believe our work shows promise for real world applications where sensors may experience different conditions from day to day; however, we acknowledge the limitations of our study and hope future work will build upon these findings in novel ways. For example, other domains might produce even richer data sets than pixel-level inputs, which could reveal additional interesting effects we have yet to observe here.",1
"Designing RNA molecules has garnered recent interest in medicine, synthetic biology, biotechnology and bioinformatics since many functional RNA molecules were shown to be involved in regulatory processes for transcription, epigenetics and translation. Since an RNA's function depends on its structural properties, the RNA Design problem is to find an RNA sequence which satisfies given structural constraints. Here, we propose a new algorithm for the RNA Design problem, dubbed LEARNA. LEARNA uses deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network to sequentially design an entire RNA sequence given a specified target structure. By meta-learning across 65000 different RNA Design tasks for one hour on 20 CPU cores, our extension Meta-LEARNA constructs an RNA Design policy that can be applied out of the box to solve novel RNA Design tasks. Methodologically, for what we believe to be the first time, we jointly optimize over a rich space of architectures for the policy network, the hyperparameters of the training procedure and the formulation of the decision process. Comprehensive empirical results on two widely-used RNA Design benchmarks, as well as a third one that we introduce, show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the former while also being orders of magnitudes faster in reaching the previous state-of-the-art performance. In an ablation study, we analyze the importance of our method's different components.",0
"In recent years there has been a surge in interest in using RNA molecules as therapeutics for treating genetic diseases caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, designing effective RNAs that can function within the complex environment of human cells remains challenging. This review focuses on strategies developed in our laboratory to increase the efficiency and stability of chemically modified RNAs used for target validation and therapy. We have developed a novel approach termed ""rational RNA design,"" which combines sequence analysis tools and biochemical assays to generate synthetic RNAs optimized for their intended purpose. Our method allows us to predict how modifications such as phosphorothioate groups, locked nucleic acids (LNAs), and other chemical substitutions will affect specific properties relevant to RNA efficacy like activity toward regulatory targets, cellular uptake, and resistance to degradation factors like nucleases. To test these predictions we examine structure/function relationships via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies and enzymatic characterization of mutant RNAs containing different modifications, focusing on ribozyme catalysts designed to cleave messenger RNAs from HIV-1 and SARS corona virus (CoV). This detailed understanding of how the structural features associated with modification influence biological activity, combined with an unprecedented ability to design and synthesize RNA ligands suitable for use in vivo and in vitro , should provide new opportunities for developing innovative RNA therapeutic agents capable of regulating gene expression patterns and treating disease states ranging from viral infection, cancer development , and genetic disorders . By offering a more comprehensive view into how sequence elements interact with chemical modifications to modulate bioactivity, our results highlight t",1
"Recent research on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) strongly promotes the adoption of distributed controller architectures. To achieve high network performance, designing a scheduling function (SF) to properly dispatch requests from each switch to suitable controllers becomes critical. However, existing literature tends to design the SF targeted at specific network settings. In this paper, a reinforcement-learning-based (RL) approach is proposed with the aim to automatically learn a general, effective, and efficient SF. In particular, a new dispatching system is introduced in which the SF is represented as a neural network that determines the priority of each controller. Based on the priorities, a controller is selected using our proposed probability selection scheme to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during learning. In order to train a general SF, we first formulate the scheduling function design problem as an RL problem. Then a new training approach is developed based on a state-of-the-art deep RL algorithm. Our simulation results show that our RL approach can rapidly design (or learn) SFs with optimal performance. Apart from that, the trained SF can generalize well and outperforms commonly used scheduling heuristics under various network settings.",0
"Abstract: Optimizing scheduling functions in software defined networking (SDN) systems has become increasingly important as traffic demands continue to grow rapidly. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown great promise in solving complex optimization problems like network resource allocation. This paper presents a DRL approach that effectively designs efficient scheduling functions for SDN networks. Our approach uses a customized policy gradient algorithm based on actor-critic architecture which allows our scheduler to learn from experience and make better decisions over time. We validate our methodology using real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing our results against traditional methods. Additionally, we present an extensive analysis of the key parameters involved in the design process, highlighting their impacts on system performance. Overall, our work shows significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, making this technique a promising solution for addressing the challenges of modern network management.",1
"Larger networks generally have greater representational power at the cost of increased computational complexity. Sparsifying such networks has been an active area of research but has been generally limited to static regularization or dynamic approaches using reinforcement learning. We explore a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to deep dynamic routing, which activates certain experts in the network on a per-example basis. Our novel DeepMoE architecture increases the representational power of standard convolutional networks by adaptively sparsifying and recalibrating channel-wise features in each convolutional layer. We employ a multi-headed sparse gating network to determine the selection and scaling of channels for each input, leveraging exponential combinations of experts within a single convolutional network. Our proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets and tasks, and we show that Deep-MoEs are able to achieve higher accuracy with lower computation than standard convolutional networks.",0
"An Expert Ensemble Model for Time Series Forecasting =============================================  Time series forecasting has been a longstanding challenge due to the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in most real world systems. In recent years, deep learning approaches have proven effective at modeling time series data. However, ensembling models is often necessary to improve accuracy and robustness. This work presents a novel approach to creating expert ensembles called ""Deep Mixture of Experts.""  Our proposed method takes advantage of modern advances in machine learning by first training individual submodels using deep neural networks (DNNs). Each DNN is trained on a different subset of the original input space, partitioned based on local linear approximations. These DNNs serve as experts in their respective regions of interest but fail to perform well outside of them. We then ensemble these experts into one final model that can make predictions anywhere within the original input space.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains including energy consumption, solar power generation, stock market indicators, weather patterns, etc.. Our results show consistent improvement over several strong baselines such as ARIMAX, Prophet, LSTM, ETS, and a simple majority voting scheme on top of independently trained DNNs.  To further investigate the behavior of our model we provide detailed ablation studies that analyze the impact of each component of our system - from the feature engineering process to the choice of hyperparameters. Additionally, visualizations illustrate how each expert contributes to the overall performance of the model and provides insights into specific behaviors exhibited by each expert during periods of high/low uncertainty.  In summary, our contributions in this work include: (i) introducing a new paradigm of building ensembles of deep neural network experts; (ii) developing a scalable implementation suitable for large scale stateful applications via meta learning techniques; (iii) conducting extensive evaluations on numerous datasets demonstrating improved generalization ability compared to other methods; (iv) providing a comprehensive analysis of key factors affecting the performance of our model and understanding of expert behaviour under different conditions.",1
"A zoo of deep nets is available these days for almost any given task, and it is increasingly unclear which net to start with when addressing a new task, or which net to use as an initialization for fine-tuning a new model. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop knowledge flow which moves 'knowledge' from multiple deep nets, referred to as teachers, to a new deep net model, called the student. The structure of the teachers and the student can differ arbitrarily and they can be trained on entirely different tasks with different output spaces too. Upon training with knowledge flow the student is independent of the teachers. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of supervised and reinforcement learning tasks, outperforming fine-tuning and other 'knowledge exchange' methods.",0
"This research seeks to explore the concept of knowledge flow in teaching and learning environments. It examines how teachers can improve upon their existing methods of imparting knowledge by identifying areas where they can optimize their delivery and approach, ultimately enhancing student outcomes. By understanding the different channels through which knowledge flows in the classroom setting, educators can gain insight into effective ways of communicating complex concepts. Additionally, the study explores techniques that facilitate active engagement between students and teachers, promoting collaboration and creating opportunities for more dynamic interactions. Overall, improving upon one’s ability as a teacher to effectively convey knowledge has far-reaching benefits, from increased retention rates among students, to improved academic performance, to better communication skills for both parties.",1
"Several applications of Reinforcement Learning suffer from instability due to high variance. This is especially prevalent in high dimensional domains. Regularization is a commonly used technique in machine learning to reduce variance, at the cost of introducing some bias. Most existing regularization techniques focus on spatial (perceptual) regularization. Yet in reinforcement learning, due to the nature of the Bellman equation, there is an opportunity to also exploit temporal regularization based on smoothness in value estimates over trajectories. This paper explores a class of methods for temporal regularization. We formally characterize the bias induced by this technique using Markov chain concepts. We illustrate the various characteristics of temporal regularization via a sequence of simple discrete and continuous MDPs, and show that the technique provides improvement even in high-dimensional Atari games.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), Markov decision processes (MDPs) play a crucial role in modeling decision making under uncertainty. However, current methods for solving MDPs suffer from various drawbacks, such as excessive conservatism and limited ability to handle complex problems with uncertainties arising from various sources. This study proposes temporal regularization as a method that can effectively address these issues by leveraging recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and Bayesian statistics. The proposed approach modifies the traditional Bellman equation underlying all dynamic programming algorithms for solving MDPs with two key components: a discount factor and a time scale parameter. By introducing these parameters, our method enables more efficient exploration through stochastic policies while reducing overfitting due to the nonlinear function approximation involved in deep neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrate how prior knowledge, such as known constraints on transition probabilities or reward functions, can be incorporated into our framework via hierarchical priors that further improve the robustness and interpretability of resulting solutions. Through extensive experiments evaluating both discrete and continuous control tasks based on real world datasets, the superiority of our temporal regularization method over existing benchmarks is shown in terms of accuracy, speed, and stability. These findings have important implications for developing reliable and scalable AI systems in domains ranging from healthcare to autonomous driving and finance. Finally, theoretical analysis clarifying how these improvements arise is provided along with suggestions for future extensions and open questions.",1
"Machine learning pipeline potentially consists of several stages of operations like data preprocessing, feature engineering and machine learning model training. Each operation has a set of hyper-parameters, which can become irrelevant for the pipeline when the operation is not selected. This gives rise to a hierarchical conditional hyper-parameter space. To optimize this mixed continuous and discrete conditional hierarchical hyper-parameter space, we propose an efficient pipeline search and configuration algorithm which combines the power of Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Optimization. Empirical results show that our method performs favorably compared to state of the art methods like Auto-sklearn , TPOT, Tree Parzen Window, and Random Search.",0
"In today’s world data and analytics has become very important aspect that helps organization in taking strategic decisions to drive their business further. With large amount of data available there becomes more importance on model selection based on parameters like accuracy, speed etc. Model selection typically depends on two aspects - Algorithm selection and parameter tuning/selection . We use machine learning algorithm and associated hyperparameters as key players here which can be selected after careful evaluation process. This involves a lot of trial and error methods to tune different hyperparameter values thus resulting into manual labor intensive task which may lead to sub optimal results sometimes. To overcome these limitations we propose new technique called “ReinBo” i.e. ‘Machine Learning pipeline search and configuration with Bayesian Optimization embedded Reinforcement Learning’ which uses Bayesian optimization techniques along with reinforcement learning to automate this cumbersome process. Our study shows promising improvements over current state of art methodologies used in industry. Thus overall our proposed approach leads to better decision making by organizations who use data driven approaches.",1
"Safe reinforcement learning has many variants and it is still an open research problem. Here, we focus on how to use action guidance by means of a non-expert demonstrator to avoid catastrophic events in a domain with sparse, delayed, and deceptive rewards: the recently-proposed multi-agent benchmark of Pommerman. This domain is very challenging for reinforcement learning (RL) --- past work has shown that model-free RL algorithms fail to achieve significant learning. In this paper, we shed light into the reasons behind this failure by exemplifying and analyzing the high rate of catastrophic events (i.e., suicides) that happen under random exploration in this domain. While model-free random exploration is typically futile, we propose a new framework where even a non-expert simulated demonstrator, e.g., planning algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search with small number of rollouts, can be integrated to asynchronous distributed deep reinforcement learning methods. Compared to vanilla deep RL algorithms, our proposed methods both learn faster and converge to better policies on a two-player mini version of the Pommerman game.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results across a wide range of domains, including game playing, control tasks, and simulation environments. However, training deep RL algorithms can often be challenging due to their high sensitivity to hyperparameters and the risk of falling into local optima during training. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is one popular method used to improve the sample efficiency and stability of deep RL algorithms by selecting more informed actions that lead to better outcomes. To further enhance the performance of deep RL algorithms using MCTS, we propose the use of shallow MCTS for efficient exploration and decision making in Pommerman, an Atari arcade game based on pizza delivery. We demonstrate how our proposed approach, Safer Deep RL with Shallow MCTS (SDRS), effectively combines deep neural networks with simplified search trees in order to make safer decisions within a complex environment. Our experimental results show that SDRS consistently achieves higher scores compared to other baseline methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of combining MCTS with deep RL algorithms to improve overall performance and safety in complex task spaces such as video games.",1
"Most approaches to visual scene analysis have emphasised parallel processing of the image elements. However, one area in which the sequential nature of vision is apparent, is that of segmenting multiple, potentially similar and partially occluded objects in a scene. In this work, we revisit the recurrent formulation of this challenging problem in the context of reinforcement learning. Motivated by the limitations of the global max-matching assignment of the ground-truth segments to the recurrent states, we develop an actor-critic approach in which the actor recurrently predicts one instance mask at a time and utilises the gradient from a concurrently trained critic network. We formulate the state, action, and the reward such as to let the critic model long-term effects of the current prediction and incorporate this information into the gradient signal. Furthermore, to enable effective exploration in the inherently high-dimensional action space of instance masks, we learn a compact representation using a conditional variational auto-encoder. We show that our actor-critic model consistently provides accuracy benefits over the recurrent baseline on standard instance segmentation benchmarks.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents actor-critic instance segmentation (AIS), a novel approach that utilizes reinforcement learning to enable an agent to select action sequences that optimize a given objective function. Our method builds upon classical model-free, offline optimization by integrating feedback from the current environment state into our planning process, allowing us to learn which actions are most likely to result in success over time. We evaluate our algorithm on three challenging problems, demonstrating significant improvements compared to traditional approaches. These results indicate that our proposed method can effectively solve complex real-world task instances efficiently. By providing efficient solutions that are tailored to the specific problem at hand, we believe that our work has broad applicability across numerous domains and fields. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research as well as implications of these findings in real-world settings.",1
"We present a reinforcement learning framework, called Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), that is designed to generate interpretable and verifiable agent policies. Unlike the popular Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm, which represents policies by neural networks, PIRL represents policies using a high-level, domain-specific programming language. Such programmatic policies have the benefits of being more easily interpreted than neural networks, and being amenable to verification by symbolic methods. We propose a new method, called Neurally Directed Program Search (NDPS), for solving the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem of finding a programmatic policy with maximal reward. NDPS works by first learning a neural policy network using DRL, and then performing a local search over programmatic policies that seeks to minimize a distance from this neural ""oracle"". We evaluate NDPS on the task of learning to drive a simulated car in the TORCS car-racing environment. We demonstrate that NDPS is able to discover human-readable policies that pass some significant performance bars. We also show that PIRL policies can have smoother trajectories, and can be more easily transferred to environments not encountered during training, than corresponding policies discovered by DRL.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for solving complex decision making problems in artificial intelligence (AI).

Our approach uses a combination of offline simulated experience and real-world demonstrations to train a model that is both effective at finding good solutions and transparent enough for humans to understand how it operates. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness through comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we show that our framework is able to produce models that are more interpretable than those generated using traditional RL methods. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",1
"To optimize clinical outcomes, fertility clinics must strategically select which embryos to transfer. Common selection heuristics are formulas expressed in terms of the durations required to reach various developmental milestones, quantities historically annotated manually by experienced embryologists based on time-lapse EmbryoScope videos. We propose a new method for automatic embryo staging that exploits several sources of structure in this time-lapse data. First, noting that in each image the embryo occupies a small subregion, we jointly train a region proposal network with the downstream classifier to isolate the embryo. Notably, because we lack ground-truth bounding boxes, our we weakly supervise the region proposal network optimizing its parameters via reinforcement learning to improve the downstream classifier's loss. Moreover, noting that embryos reaching the blastocyst stage progress monotonically through earlier stages, we develop a dynamic-programming-based decoder that post-processes our predictions to select the most likely monotonic sequence of developmental stages. Our methods outperform vanilla residual networks and rival the best numbers in contemporary papers, as measured by both per-frame accuracy and transition prediction error, despite operating on smaller data than many.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to embryo staging using weakly supervised learning techniques. We propose a method that combines region selection based on low-level features such as texture and color with dynamic decoding strategies that account for spatial relationships among regions. Our method can effectively handle large variations in image quality and acquisition conditions while still producing accurate stage assignments. Results show significant improvement over existing methods across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Overall, this work represents an important step forward in automated embryo staging and has potential applications in clinical settings.",1
"Dense video captioning is an extremely challenging task since accurate and coherent description of events in a video requires holistic understanding of video contents as well as contextual reasoning of individual events. Most existing approaches handle this problem by first detecting event proposals from a video and then captioning on a subset of the proposals. As a result, the generated sentences are prone to be redundant or inconsistent since they fail to consider temporal dependency between events. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel dense video captioning framework, which models temporal dependency across events in a video explicitly and leverages visual and linguistic context from prior events for coherent storytelling. This objective is achieved by 1) integrating an event sequence generation network to select a sequence of event proposals adaptively, and 2) feeding the sequence of event proposals to our sequential video captioning network, which is trained by reinforcement learning with two-level rewards at both event and episode levels for better context modeling. The proposed technique achieves outstanding performances on ActivityNet Captions dataset in most metrics.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in natural language processing tasks like text summarization, translation, and machine translation which have relied on deep learning models trained using large datasets such as ImageNet. Despite these advances in natural language processing, dense video captioning remains a challenging task due to its high memory requirements and computational complexity. As videos become more accessible online, demand for automated methods to describe their content continues to increase. However, existing solutions are limited by either accuracy issues, scalability, or cost constraints, making them impractical for real world applications. The authors propose an end-to-end system called ""StreamlinedDenseCaptioner"" that addresses these limitations by leveraging the benefits of both modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, while optimizing training parameters to minimize costs and ensure accurate descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the art approaches achieving superior accuracy, speed, and affordability for dense video captioning. Overall, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for efficient and reliable video description generation suitable for use across various industries and application scenarios.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has achieved superior performance in complex sequential tasks by using a deep neural network as its function approximator and by learning directly from raw images. A drawback of using raw images is that deep RL must learn the state feature representation from the raw images in addition to learning a policy. As a result, deep RL can require a prohibitively large amount of training time and data to reach reasonable performance, making it difficult to use deep RL in real-world applications, especially when data is expensive. In this work, we speed up training by addressing half of what deep RL is trying to solve --- learning features. Our approach is to learn some of the important features by pre-training deep RL network's hidden layers via supervised learning using a small set of human demonstrations. We empirically evaluate our approach using deep Q-network (DQN) and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithms on the Atari 2600 games of Pong, Freeway, and Beamrider. Our results show that: 1) pre-training with human demonstrations in a supervised learning manner is better at discovering features relative to pre-training naively in DQN, and 2) initializing a deep RL network with a pre-trained model provides a significant improvement in training time even when pre-training from a small number of human demonstrations.",0
"Here’s an example: Recent work has shown that incorporating human demonstrations into the pre-training process can significantly improve performance on deep reinforcement learning tasks. This approach leverages prior knowledge from human experts to guide the neural network towards optimal policies more quickly than traditional methods. In our paper we present results showing how using human demonstrations during pre-training can lead to improved efficiency and effectiveness in problem solving. We evaluate this method across several benchmark tasks and demonstrate its ability to scale to complex environments. Our findings suggest that integrating human intuition into artificial intelligence algorithms holds great promise for accelerating progress in automation and decision making. Overall, this research represents a significant step forward in the development of intelligent agents capable of solving real world problems to benefit society.",1
"We introduce Bayesian least-squares policy iteration (BLSPI), an off-policy, model-free, policy iteration algorithm that uses the Bayesian least-squares temporal-difference (BLSTD) learning algorithm to evaluate policies. An online variant of BLSPI has been also proposed, called randomised BLSPI (RBLSPI), that improves its policy based on an incomplete policy evaluation step. In online setting, the exploration-exploitation dilemma should be addressed as we try to discover the optimal policy by using samples collected by ourselves. RBLSPI exploits the advantage of BLSTD to quantify our uncertainty about the value function. Inspired by Thompson sampling, RBLSPI first samples a value function from a posterior distribution over value functions, and then selects actions based on the sampled value function. The effectiveness and the exploration abilities of RBLSPI are demonstrated experimentally in several environments.",0
"This paper presents a novel methodology, called Randomised Bayesian Least-Squares Policy Iteration (RBLSPI), which allows us to model real-time stochastic systems using continuous belief functions. RBLSPI combines the strengths of least squares policy iteration and randomized algorithmic differentiation with Bayesian inference on continuous spaces using Gaussian processes. Our approach represents the first attempt at applying such techniques to engineering decision making under uncertainty. In particular, we apply our technique to traffic signal control and demonstrate promising results compared against other methods currently used in practice. We hope that this work opens up new opportunities for exploring alternative approaches to modeling complex real-world scenarios with uncertain parameters. While there remain several challenges ahead, we believe that RBLSPI offers a valuable tool for researchers working at the intersection of machine learning, optimal control, and decision analysis.",1
"Model quantization is a widely used technique to compress and accelerate deep neural network (DNN) inference. Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design.",0
"Accurate quantization has become increasingly important as machine learning models need to run on devices without access to GPUs or the internet. However, current methods rely heavily on manual intervention, which can be time consuming and error prone. In this work we propose a new approach called HAQ that combines mixed precision training and hardware-aware pruning techniques. Using our method, users can achieve high levels of accuracy while minimizing compute requirements. Our results show that we outperform existing automated quantization techniques by significant margins across multiple datasets and model architectures. We believe HAQ provides a valuable contribution towards enabling fast and accurate machine learning at the edge.",1
"Vision-language navigation (VLN) is the task of navigating an embodied agent to carry out natural language instructions inside real 3D environments. In this paper, we study how to address three critical challenges for this task: the cross-modal grounding, the ill-posed feedback, and the generalization problems. First, we propose a novel Reinforced Cross-Modal Matching (RCM) approach that enforces cross-modal grounding both locally and globally via reinforcement learning (RL). Particularly, a matching critic is used to provide an intrinsic reward to encourage global matching between instructions and trajectories, and a reasoning navigator is employed to perform cross-modal grounding in the local visual scene. Evaluation on a VLN benchmark dataset shows that our RCM model significantly outperforms previous methods by 10% on SPL and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance. To improve the generalizability of the learned policy, we further introduce a Self-Supervised Imitation Learning (SIL) method to explore unseen environments by imitating its own past, good decisions. We demonstrate that SIL can approximate a better and more efficient policy, which tremendously minimizes the success rate performance gap between seen and unseen environments (from 30.7% to 11.7%).",0
"This paper presents two novel approaches for vision-language navigation: reinforced cross-modal matching (RCM) and self-supervised imitation learning (SSIL). RCM learns a joint embedding space for visual and textual representations by minimizing the difference between ground truth image-text pairs and generated counterparts on a large dataset. SSIL uses a pre-trained model to generate trajectories that attempt to match human references in the real world, which improves generalization of the agent’s behavior. We evaluate these methods on four popular datasets, showing significant improvements over baseline models and strong correlation with human performance. Our work highlights the importance of effective cross-modal alignment and exploratory behaviors for achieving high quality results in vision-language tasks.",1
"Attention models have had a significant positive impact on deep learning across a range of tasks. However previous attempts at integrating attention with reinforcement learning have failed to produce significant improvements. We propose the first combination of self attention and reinforcement learning that is capable of producing significant improvements, including new state of the art results in the Arcade Learning Environment. Unlike the selective attention models used in previous attempts, which constrain the attention via preconceived notions of importance, our implementation utilises the Markovian properties inherent in the state input. Our method produces a faithful visualisation of the policy, focusing on the behaviour of the agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the trained policies use multiple simultaneous foci of attention, and are able to modulate attention over time to deal with situations of partial observability.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for training intelligent agents to solve complex tasks by interacting with their environment. However, many existing RL algorithms suffer from limitations such as brittleness to changes in the task distribution, instability during training, and poor generalization performance on unseen environments. To address these challenges, we propose a self-supervised approach for training attention-based RL models. Our method leverages large amounts of data generated from random interactions with the environment to pretrain the agent’s representation network, which subsequently improves the stability and effectiveness of fine-tuning for specific tasks. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark domains, including continuous control problems, navigation tasks, and language understanding experiments. Results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of trained agents. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing more reliable and versatile RL models for real-world applications.",1
"Policy gradient algorithms typically combine discounted future rewards with an estimated value function, to compute the direction and magnitude of parameter updates. However, for most Reinforcement Learning tasks, humans can provide additional insight to constrain the policy learning. We introduce a general method to incorporate multiple different feedback channels into a single policy gradient loss. In our formulation, the Multi-Preference Actor Critic (M-PAC), these different types of feedback are implemented as constraints on the policy. We use a Lagrangian relaxation to satisfy these constraints using gradient descent while learning a policy that maximizes rewards. Experiments in Atari and Pendulum verify that constraints are being respected and can accelerate the learning process.",0
"In our research, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called Multi-Preference Actor Critic (MPAC), which addresses one of the key challenges faced by current state-of-the-art RL algorithms: the need to balance multiple objectives at once. MPAC takes inspiration from multi-objective optimization techniques and extends them to the actor critic framework, allowing agents to learn policies that optimize tradeoffs between competing preferences.  In particular, our approach uses a preference function that maps states, actions, and outcomes onto a set of priorities, reflecting how well different criteria are met. By incorporating these diverse preferences into the agent’s value estimation and policy improvement processes, MPAC can more effectively handle complex decision problems involving competing goals. To achieve this, we design two variants of the MPAC architecture, one based on Q-learning and another using deep neural networks. Our experiments show promising results across a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, demonstrating that our method leads to significant improvements over baseline models as well as several advanced multi-preference models. We hope that this work serves as a step forward towards developing intelligent agents capable of tackling real-world problems that involve compromises among diverse objectives.",1
"Wasserstein distances are increasingly used in a wide variety of applications in machine learning. Sliced Wasserstein distances form an important subclass which may be estimated efficiently through one-dimensional sorting operations. In this paper, we propose a new variant of sliced Wasserstein distance, study the use of orthogonal coupling in Monte Carlo estimation of Wasserstein distances and draw connections with stratified sampling, and evaluate our approaches experimentally in a range of large-scale experiments in generative modelling and reinforcement learning.",0
"Infer the title from content. Useful phrases include: ""We propose a new method"", ""In this paper we introduce"", etc. Orthogonal estimation of Wasserstein distances allows us to efficiently compute the distance between two probability measures by leveraging recent advancements in deep learning. We develop a novel algorithm based on neural network architectures, which can estimate transport plans in high dimensions with a provably small error bound. Our approach extends previous work in orthogonal projections for Kantorovich potentials and minimizing approximations using neural networks. By optimizing over an efficient representation of feasible transport plans in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while being competitive against strong baselines in runtime efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method has promising applications in machine learning tasks that require optimal transport computations, including generative models and image synthesis problems.",1
"A central challenge in reinforcement learning is discovering effective policies for tasks where rewards are sparsely distributed. We postulate that in the absence of useful reward signals, an effective exploration strategy should seek out {\it decision states}. These states lie at critical junctions in the state space from where the agent can transition to new, potentially unexplored regions. We propose to learn about decision states from prior experience. By training a goal-conditioned policy with an information bottleneck, we can identify decision states by examining where the model actually leverages the goal state. We find that this simple mechanism effectively identifies decision states, even in partially observed settings. In effect, the model learns the sensory cues that correlate with potential subgoals. In new environments, this model can then identify novel subgoals for further exploration, guiding the agent through a sequence of potential decision states and through new regions of the state space.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to transfer learning and exploration using the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. The IB method has been shown to be effective in a variety of tasks, but its application in transfer learning and exploration has not yet been fully realized. We propose InfoBot, which uses the IB framework as a way of selecting informative features that can be transferred from source domains to target domains, enabling efficient adaptation without requiring large amounts of data from the target domain. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoBot across several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on many transfer learning tasks while minimizing the amount of labeled target data required. These findings have important implications for understanding how information bottlenecks shape representation learning and provide guidance for designing better machine learning algorithms that balance efficiency and accuracy under varying resource constraints. Overall, our work represents a significant contribution to the field of transfer learning and exploration, demonstrating the power of the IB principle for developing flexible and adaptive systems that perform well across diverse scenarios.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are known to be data inefficient. One reason is that a DRL agent learns both the feature and the policy tabula rasa. Integrating prior knowledge into DRL algorithms is one way to improve learning efficiency since it helps to build helpful representations. In this work, we consider incorporating human knowledge to accelerate the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm by pre-training a small amount of non-expert human demonstrations. We leverage the supervised autoencoder framework and propose a novel pre-training strategy that jointly trains a weighted supervised classification loss, an unsupervised reconstruction loss, and an expected return loss. The resulting pre-trained model learns more useful features compared to independently training in supervised or unsupervised fashion. Our pre-training method drastically improved the learning performance of the A3C agent in Atari games of Pong and MsPacman, exceeding the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms at a much smaller number of game interactions. Our method is light-weight and easy to implement in a single machine. For reproducibility, our code is available at github.com/gabrieledcjr/DeepRL/tree/A3C-ALA2019",0
"In this work we consider deep reinforcement learning agents that can learn from three kinds of losses: supervised classification loss (i.e., cross entropy), autoencoding reconstruction loss (i.e., binary cross entropy), and value prediction loss (using Q values). We present two preliminary experiments in which the agent is trained on these joint losses by alternating phases of RL training under one objective at a time, but where we adjust the contributions of each kind of loss so as to balance them approximately equally; thus, during any given phase, all three losses contribute roughly as much to the total loss used by the RL algorithm. After describing the architecture of our agent and the choices made regarding hyperparameters, we show results demonstrating significant improvements over single objective baselines across most metrics in both environments. These initial successes provide strong evidence that combining multiple types of feedback signals via value function regression may yield more effective DRL agents than relying exclusively on traditional policy gradient methods guided only by predicting expected returns under some unknown reward model.",1
"We propose a new automated digital painting framework, based on a painting agent trained through reinforcement learning. To synthesize an image, the agent selects a sequence of continuous-valued actions representing primitive painting strokes, which are accumulated on a digital canvas. Action selection is guided by a given reference image, which the agent attempts to replicate subject to the limitations of the action space and the agent's learned policy. The painting agent policy is determined using a variant of proximal policy optimization reinforcement learning. During training, our agent is presented with patches sampled from an ensemble of reference images. To accelerate training convergence, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy, whereby reference patches are sampled according to how challenging they are using the current policy. We experiment with differing loss functions, including pixel-wise and perceptual loss, which have consequent differing effects on the learned policy. We demonstrate that our painting agent can learn an effective policy with a high dimensional continuous action space comprising pen pressure, width, tilt, and color, for a variety of painting styles. Through a coarse-to-fine refinement process our agent can paint arbitrarily complex images in the desired style.",0

"An important goal of research in Deep Reinforcement Learning in mobile robotics is to train agents capable of solving complex tasks, which require a high level of scene understanding and reasoning from an egocentric perspective. When trained from simulations, optimal environments should satisfy a currently unobtainable combination of high-fidelity photographic observations, massive amounts of different environment configurations and fast simulation speeds. In this paper we argue that research on training agents capable of complex reasoning can be simplified by decoupling from the requirement of high fidelity photographic observations. We present a suite of tasks requiring complex reasoning and exploration in continuous, partially observable 3D environments. The objective is to provide challenging scenarios and a robust baseline agent architecture that can be trained on mid-range consumer hardware in under 24h. Our scenarios combine two key advantages: (i) they are based on a simple but highly efficient 3D environment (ViZDoom) which allows high speed simulation (12000fps); (ii) the scenarios provide the user with a range of difficulty settings, in order to identify the limitations of current state of the art algorithms and network architectures. We aim to increase accessibility to the field of Deep-RL by providing baselines for challenging scenarios where new ideas can be iterated on quickly. We argue that the community should be able to address challenging problems in reasoning of mobile agents without the need for a large compute infrastructure.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to deep reinforcement learning that requires minimal computational resources. In recent years, advances in deep reinforcement learning have been limited by the availability of large supercomputers. However, we demonstrate that high-quality control policies can still be learned even without access to such powerful machines. Our method builds upon previous work in end-to-end deep learning for robotics, but extends it to more complex tasks requiring both continuous control and reasoning abilities. We evaluate our method using challenging benchmarks, showing that it outperforms baseline methods while requiring significantly less computational power. Our results suggest that deep reinforcement learning may become accessible to a wider range of researchers and practitioners.",1
"We devise a distributional variant of gradient temporal-difference (TD) learning. Distributional reinforcement learning has been demonstrated to outperform the regular one in the recent study \citep{bellemare2017distributional}. In the policy evaluation setting, we design two new algorithms called distributional GTD2 and distributional TDC using the Cram{\'e}r distance on the distributional version of the Bellman error objective function, which inherits advantages of both the nonlinear gradient TD algorithms and the distributional RL approach. In the control setting, we propose the distributional Greedy-GQ using the similar derivation. We prove the asymptotic almost-sure convergence of distributional GTD2 and TDC to a local optimal solution for general smooth function approximators, which includes neural networks that have been widely used in recent study to solve the real-life RL problems. In each step, the computational complexities of above three algorithms are linear w.r.t.\ the number of the parameters of the function approximator, thus can be implemented efficiently for neural networks.",0
"In Reinforcement Learning (RL), learning algorithms interact with their environment by taking actions that affect the state they observe next. This process can take several steps before the algorithm learns whether each action was correct or not. To adapt more quickly to changing situations, it would be beneficial if RL agents could learn from both successful and failed experiences without waiting multiple time steps. However, such adaptations tend to interfere with one another over successive interactions. We propose an actor critic architecture called Nonlinear Distributional Gradient Temporal Difference (GTD) Learning which addresses these issues by maintaining estimates based on the most relevant past experiences rather than simply averaging them as in traditional TD methods. Furthermore, we show how this approach reduces variance and allows faster learning rates compared to popular alternatives like SARSA and Q-learning while improving overall performance on challenging benchmark tasks.",1
"In this paper, we study a multi-step interactive recommendation problem, where the item recommended at current step may affect the quality of future recommendations. To address the problem, we develop a novel and effective approach, named CFRL, which seamlessly integrates the ideas of both collaborative filtering (CF) and reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we first model the recommender-user interactive recommendation problem as an agent-environment RL task, which is mathematically described by a Markov decision process (MDP). Further, to achieve collaborative recommendations for the entire user community, we propose a novel CF-based MDP by encoding the states of all users into a shared latent vector space. Finally, we propose an effective Q-network learning method to learn the agent's optimal policy based on the CF-based MDP. The capability of CFRL is demonstrated by comparing its performance against a variety of existing methods on real-world datasets.",0
"Collaborative filtering has been successfully used in recommender systems to predict user ratings by analyzing patterns in users' past preferences and behavior. However, these models often suffer from cold-start problems, where they have difficulty making accurate recommendations for new items or users without sufficient data. In recent years, reinforcement learning algorithms have shown promise as a means of improving collaborative filtering models by incorporating feedback signals and encouraging exploration towards more relevant items. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and reinforcement learning techniques to address the cold-start problem and improve recommendation accuracy overall. We present empirical results on several real-world datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. Our findings suggest that combining collaborative filtering with reinforcement learning can significantly enhance the performance of recommender systems, particularly for cold-start situations where there may be limited historical user data available. Overall, this work contributes to the growing field of personalized recommender systems by offering a novel solution that effectively balances collaboration among similar users with individual exploration strategies driven by reward signals.",1
"Recognition of defects in concrete infrastructure, especially in bridges, is a costly and time consuming crucial first step in the assessment of the structural integrity. Large variation in appearance of the concrete material, changing illumination and weather conditions, a variety of possible surface markings as well as the possibility for different types of defects to overlap, make it a challenging real-world task. In this work we introduce the novel COncrete DEfect BRidge IMage dataset (CODEBRIM) for multi-target classification of five commonly appearing concrete defects. We investigate and compare two reinforcement learning based meta-learning approaches, MetaQNN and efficient neural architecture search, to find suitable convolutional neural network architectures for this challenging multi-class multi-target task. We show that learned architectures have fewer overall parameters in addition to yielding better multi-target accuracy in comparison to popular neural architectures from the literature evaluated in the context of our application.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks such as defect detection in concrete bridge decks using the CONCRETE DEFECT BRIDGE IMAGE dataset. Despite their effectiveness, these models require large amounts of data to train effectively, making them difficult to apply to new domains without substantial retraining. To address this issue, we propose a meta-learning approach that enables the transfer of knowledge from one domain to another while leveraging prior training experience. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: the CODALESA and DIGITS benchmarks. Our results show significant improvements over baseline methods, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence speeds across different target tasks. This work demonstrates the potential benefits of metalearning for CNN architectures and could lead to more efficient deployment of deep learning models in practice.",1
"We propose a general-purpose approach to discovering active learning (AL) strategies from data. These strategies are transferable from one domain to another and can be used in conjunction with many machine learning models. To this end, we formalize the annotation process as a Markov decision process, design universal state and action spaces and introduce a new reward function that precisely model the AL objective of minimizing the annotation cost. We seek to find an optimal (non-myopic) AL strategy using reinforcement learning. We evaluate the learned strategies on multiple unrelated domains and show that they consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for discovering effective active learning strategies that can be applied to a wide range of tasks and domains. By using probabilistic models to evaluate the uncertainty and informativity of different input queries, we show how existing techniques such as query by committee (QBC) and Bayesian optimization (BO) can be adapted to more effectively learn from user feedback. Our approach allows us to identify which types of questions are most likely to lead to rapid improvement and makes use of prior knowledge and domain-specific heuristics to guide the search process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing general-purpose active learning algorithms that can excel across diverse application scenarios.",1
"As deep reinforcement learning driven by visual perception becomes more widely used there is a growing need to better understand and probe the learned agents. Understanding the decision making process and its relationship to visual inputs can be very valuable to identify problems in learned behavior. However, this topic has been relatively under-explored in the research community. In this work we present a method for synthesizing visual inputs of interest for a trained agent. Such inputs or states could be situations in which specific actions are necessary. Further, critical states in which a very high or a very low reward can be achieved are often interesting to understand the situational awareness of the system as they can correspond to risky states. To this end, we learn a generative model over the state space of the environment and use its latent space to optimize a target function for the state of interest. In our experiments we show that this method can generate insights for a variety of environments and reinforcement learning methods. We explore results in the standard Atari benchmark games as well as in an autonomous driving simulator. Based on the efficiency with which we have been able to identify behavioural weaknesses with this technique, we believe this general approach could serve as an important tool for AI safety applications.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning agents have recently been shown to perform at superhuman levels across a variety of complex tasks. However, despite their impressive capabilities, these agents remain vulnerable to certain types of attacks that exploit weaknesses in their training process. In this work, we present a systematic approach for finding and visualizing such vulnerabilities in deep RL agents. Our method involves generating carefully designed input perturbations, which force the agent to make decisions based on spurious patterns rather than true environmental features. By analyzing the resulting behavior of the agent, we can identify previously unknown failure modes and gain insights into the decision making processes of deep RL models. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and showcase how our findings can inform future research in this field.",1
"In this paper we present our scientific discovery that good representation can be learned via continuous attention during the interaction between Unsupervised Learning(UL) and Reinforcement Learning(RL) modules driven by intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we designed intrinsic rewards generated from UL modules for driving the RL agent to focus on objects for a period of time and to learn good representations of objects for later object recognition task. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in both with and without extrinsic reward settings. Experiments with end-to-end training in simulated environments with applications to few-shot object recognition demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",0
"This paper describes how to create good representations using attention mechanisms within neural networks (NNs). We first define what makes something a ""representation,"" including both philosophical and technical meanings. Then we describe why representation matters for NNs, as well as some common issues that arise in practice. Finally we describe how continuous attention can solve these problems in order to learn better representations faster and more reliably. These improvements are demonstrated on several different datasets including language modeling tasks where our approach sets new state of the art results across multiple metrics.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has recently made significant progress in solving computer games and robotic control tasks. A known problem, though, is that policies overfit to the training environment and may not avoid rare, catastrophic events such as automotive accidents. A classical technique for improving the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms is to train on a set of randomized environments, but this approach only guards against common situations. Recently, robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was developed, which allows efficient applications of random and systematic perturbations by a trained adversary. A limitation of RARL is that only the expected control objective is optimized; there is no explicit modeling or optimization of risk. Thus the agents do not consider the probability of catastrophic events (i.e., those inducing abnormally large negative reward), except through their effect on the expected objective. In this paper we introduce risk-averse robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARARL), using a risk-averse protagonist and a risk-seeking adversary. We test our approach on a self-driving vehicle controller. We use an ensemble of policy networks to model risk as the variance of value functions. We show through experiments that a risk-averse agent is better equipped to handle a risk-seeking adversary, and experiences substantially fewer crashes compared to agents trained without an adversary.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can learn robust policies in adversarial settings. One approach towards achieving this goal is through the use of risk averse reinforcement learning algorithms. These algorithms aim to maximize expected returns while also considering the variability of possible outcomes, which makes them more resilient to unexpected changes in the environment. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm called RARL (Risk Averse Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning) that combines elements from both adversarial training and risk sensitive exploration strategies. Our method learns policies that are both robust against worst-case scenarios and efficient in terms of cumulative reward achieved over time. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark tasks, including games and control problems, showing that RARL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across different domains. Overall, this research demonstrates how combining ideas from adversarial training and risk sensitivity can lead to more robust and efficient decision making agents. -----In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for robotics using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The problem addressed is visual servoing based on deep reinforcement learning. Despite some successful applications of visual servoing, most existing works rely heavily on hand engineering features, which limits their performance. Instead, we design an end-to-end solution capable of learning features suitable for both accurate tracking and reliable convergence to desired configurations. In particular, our agent predicts discrete actions by comparing pixel-wise differences between current sensor images and target image templates. For better generalization, we employ policy distillation and experience replay. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements compared to prior arts in similar setups where we achieve faster convergence times and lower error rates on three challenging datasets: KUKA Robot Arm VI, AntTerrainVelma7D, and Franka Emika Panda robot arm.",1
"Mutual information maximization has emerged as a powerful learning objective for unsupervised representation learning obtaining state-of-the-art performance in applications such as object recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. However, such approaches are fundamentally limited since a tight lower bound of mutual information requires sample size exponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these approaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video understanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are prone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the relevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that are not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to learn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To mitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which learns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead of the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator. We show that a practical approximation to this theoretically motivated solution, constructed using Lipschitz constraint techniques from the GAN literature, achieves substantially improved results on tasks where incomplete representations are a major challenge.",0
"Deep learning has made remarkable progress in areas such as image classification, speech recognition, and language translation, thanks largely to advancements in representation learning. However, evaluating representations remains a challenge due to the lack of effective measures that can quantify their quality. Existing metrics mostly focus on measuring similarity or dissimilarity between distributions or samples, but they fail to capture more subtle aspects such as causality or complexity. In this work, we propose the Wasserstein Dependency Measure (WDM), which takes into account both statistical and causal dependencies present in representations. WDM bridges the gap between representation learning and feature-based modeling by leveraging recent developments in inverse optimization, optimal transport theory, and neural networks. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on synthetic data sets and real-world tasks that WDM outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Overall, our work provides a powerful tool for understanding and improving the performance of deep learning models.",1
"Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in learning complicated behaviors from minimally processed input. However, most of this success is limited to simulation. While there are promising successes in applying RL algorithms directly on real systems, their performance on more complex systems remains bottle-necked by the relative data inefficiency of RL algorithms. Domain randomization is a promising direction of research that has demonstrated impressive results using RL algorithms to control real robots. At a high level, domain randomization works by training a policy on a distribution of environmental conditions in simulation. If the environments are diverse enough, then the policy trained on this distribution will plausibly generalize to the real world. A human-specified design choice in domain randomization is the form and parameters of the distribution of simulated environments. It is unclear how to the best pick the form and parameters of this distribution and prior work uses hand-tuned distributions. This extended abstract demonstrates that the choice of the distribution plays a major role in the performance of the trained policies in the real world and that the parameter of this distribution can be optimized to maximize the performance of the trained policies in the real world",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to real world robotics problems like grasping, locomotion, collision avoidance etc. Training them on real robots can take very long time because physical systems are slow, may fail and are often expensive and/or difficult to access. For that reason, several methods were proposed to train RL algorithms on simulation only but make use of real robots to test them. This process is called sim-to-real transfer. One popular method to improve generalizability across different setups is Domain Randomization (DR). DR introduces variability into simulation which helps RL agents learn robust behavior against similar changes seen at testing time during deployment on real robots. But DR has many hyperparameters that must be selected beforehand. Otherwise the agent might achieve high performance on average through the distribution of variations whereas the policy is still unable to perform well when deployed onto the real system - it would then either underperform compared to the untrained baseline or fall prey to overfitting on a specific setup and struggle adapting to even small differences on other, previously unseen setups. Even though tuned for higher average performance, such an agent could be useless for practitioners using one specific instance where e.g. sensors changed slightly. We want an algorithm to optimize those hyperparameter choices directly for better overall sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. To tackle this problem we propose the following contributions: An efficient solution method to compute the gradient updates of both main actor and target network that requires little computation. It is able to handle offline pretraining followed by online fine-tuning as wel",1
"Reinforcement learning algorithms rely on exploration to discover new behaviors, which is typically achieved by following a stochastic policy. In continuous control tasks, policies with a Gaussian distribution have been widely adopted. Gaussian exploration however does not result in smooth trajectories that generally correspond to safe and rewarding behaviors in practical tasks. In addition, Gaussian policies do not result in an effective exploration of an environment and become increasingly inefficient as the action rate increases. This contributes to a low sample efficiency often observed in learning continuous control tasks. We introduce a family of stationary autoregressive (AR) stochastic processes to facilitate exploration in continuous control domains. We show that proposed processes possess two desirable features: subsequent process observations are temporally coherent with continuously adjustable degree of coherence, and the process stationary distribution is standard normal. We derive an autoregressive policy (ARP) that implements such processes maintaining the standard agent-environment interface. We show how ARPs can be easily used with the existing off-the-shelf learning algorithms. Empirically we demonstrate that using ARPs results in improved exploration and sample efficiency in both simulated and real world domains, and, furthermore, provides smooth exploration trajectories that enable safe operation of robotic hardware.",0
"This paper presents a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses autoregressive policies to learn complex control tasks directly from raw sensory input streams. We show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results on continuous control benchmark problems and outperforms other methods when trained using only low-bandwidth sensor feedback. Our approach builds upon recent advances in deep reinforcement learning but differs in several key respects: we use variational inference to compute gradients and update policy parameters; we employ an ensemble of neural networks rather than a single model to represent uncertainty over policies; and we adopt a novel exploration strategy based on randomized actions and noise injection. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that these modifications lead to substantial improvements in both sample efficiency and final performance compared to prior algorithms. Moreover, we find that our algorithm can generalize well across a diverse set of benchmark environments without retraining, suggesting strong robustness and flexibility. Taken together, these contributions support the development and deployment of more advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of operating in high-dimensional real-world domains under tight constraints on data usage and computational resources.",1
"Learning near-optimal behaviour from an expert's demonstrations typically relies on the assumption that the learner knows the features that the true reward function depends on. In this paper, we study the problem of learning from demonstrations in the setting where this is not the case, i.e., where there is a mismatch between the worldviews of the learner and the expert. We introduce a natural quantity, the teaching risk, which measures the potential suboptimality of policies that look optimal to the learner in this setting. We show that bounds on the teaching risk guarantee that the learner is able to find a near-optimal policy using standard algorithms based on inverse reinforcement learning. Based on these findings, we suggest a teaching scheme in which the expert can decrease the teaching risk by updating the learner's worldview, and thus ultimately enable her to find a near-optimal policy.",0
This abstract describes how inverse reinforcement learning (RL) uses features and demonstrations to train agents. We investigate training environments that have multiple reward functions in order to test our agent on scenarios where human feedback may disagree. Our results show promising improvements over traditional inverse RL methods in these situations. Additionally we discuss future potential applications for these advancements. Overall our work suggests that using features and demonstration has great potentials as a new methodology in the study of IRL.,1
"Learning is an inherently continuous phenomenon. When humans learn a new task there is no explicit distinction between training and inference. As we learn a task, we keep learning about it while performing the task. What we learn and how we learn it varies during different stages of learning. Learning how to learn and adapt is a key property that enables us to generalize effortlessly to new settings. This is in contrast with conventional settings in machine learning where a trained model is frozen during inference. In this paper we study the problem of learning to learn at both training and test time in the context of visual navigation. A fundamental challenge in navigation is generalization to unseen scenes. In this paper we propose a self-adaptive visual navigation method (SAVN) which learns to adapt to new environments without any explicit supervision. Our solution is a meta-reinforcement learning approach where an agent learns a self-supervised interaction loss that encourages effective navigation. Our experiments, performed in the AI2-THOR framework, show major improvements in both success rate and SPL for visual navigation in novel scenes. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/allenai/savn .",0
"This paper presents a method for self-adaptive visual navigation using meta-learning. We propose a new approach that enables agents to learn how to navigate complex environments by leveraging knowledge acquired from previous experiences. Our method utilizes deep reinforcement learning techniques to enable efficient exploration and improve performance over time. To evaluate our proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging domains such as first-person view (FPV) racing and robotic manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate the superiority of our meta-learning approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. By enabling agents to rapidly adapt their behaviors based on prior knowledge, our work paves the way towards more effective autonomous systems capable of operating in dynamic and unpredictable environments.",1
"Estimating over-amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on invasive breast cancer (BC) is regarded as a significant predictive and prognostic marker. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based model that treats immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring of HER2 as a sequential learning task. For a given image tile sampled from multi-resolution giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI), the model learns to sequentially identify some of the diagnostically relevant regions of interest (ROIs) by following a parameterized policy. The selected ROIs are processed by recurrent and residual convolution networks to learn the discriminative features for different HER2 scores and predict the next location, without requiring to process all the sub-image patches of a given tile for predicting the HER2 score, mimicking the histopathologist who would not usually analyze every part of the slide at the highest magnification. The proposed model incorporates a task-specific regularization term and inhibition of return mechanism to prevent the model from revisiting the previously attended locations. We evaluated our model on two IHC datasets: a publicly available dataset from the HER2 scoring challenge contest and another dataset consisting of WSIs of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor sections stained with Glo1 marker. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other methods based on state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using DRL for IHC scoring and could potentially lead to wider use of DRL in the domain of computational pathology reducing the computational burden of the analysis of large multigigapixel histology images.",0
"Automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis has become increasingly important in clinical diagnostics and medical research due to its ability to quantify protein expression levels in tissue samples at high throughput. While current automated IHC systems rely on predefined regions of interest (ROIs) to evaluate the staining intensity, these ROIs may not capture all relevant areas of interest or contain nonrelevant background regions. We propose a novel attention model that learns where to focus attention during automated scoring by optimizing the spatial distribution of ROIs adaptively based on image features from the whole slide image. Our approach outperforms traditional fixed and random ROI methods in terms of interobserver agreement and Hausdorff distance measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy for quantitative assessment of IHC images. Moreover, our method can reduce the number of selected ROIs significantly while maintaining superior performance compared with previous approaches, suggesting potential benefits for time savings and reduced workload in pathology workflows. These findings highlight the promise of using machine learning algorithms such as our proposed attention model for enhancing the quality and efficiency of automated IHC analysis in digital histopathology applications.

"In autonomous embedded systems, it is often vital to reduce the amount of actions taken in the real world and energy required to learn a policy. Training reinforcement learning agents from high dimensional image representations can be very expensive and time consuming. Autoencoders are deep neural network used to compress high dimensional data such as pixelated images into small latent representations. This compression model is vital to efficiently learn policies, especially when learning on embedded systems. We have implemented this model on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded GPU, and evaluated the power consumption, throughput, and energy consumption of the autoencoders for various CPU/GPU core combinations, frequencies, and model parameters. Additionally, we have shown the reconstructions generated by the autoencoder to analyze the quality of the generated compressed representation and also the performance of the reinforcement learning agent. Finally, we have presented an assessment of the viability of training these models on embedded systems and their usefulness in developing autonomous policies. Using autoencoders, we were able to achieve 4-5 $\times$ improved performance compared to a baseline RL agent with a convolutional feature extractor, while using less than 2W of power.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has proven to be highly effective at solving complex problems across many domains, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics. One key challenge facing these applications is how to efficiently learn from data, given that acquiring large amounts of labelled training data can often be time-consuming and expensive. This task becomes particularly challenging in the context of reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent must interact with the environment over multiple episodes in order to learn effective policies. In practice, RL algorithms typically require millions of interactions before they can reach satisfactory performance levels, making them difficult to deploy on real-world systems with limited resources. To address this issue, we propose using deep autoencoders as a method for efficient embedded representation learning in RL. By pretraining a deep neural network on random noise inputs and then fine-tuning it on experience replay data generated by the actor during interaction with the environment, the agent is able to quickly develop high-quality representations of state transitions without requiring additional supervision. Through empirical evaluation on several benchmark tasks, we demonstrate that our approach leads to significant improvements in sample efficiency and overall policy quality compared to baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of using deep autoencoders as a powerful tool for accelerating the development of advanced artificial intelligence agents.",1
"In this paper we study a new reinforcement learning setting where the environment is non-rewarding, contains several possibly related objects of various controllability, and where an apt agent Bob acts independently, with non-observable intentions. We argue that this setting defines a realistic scenario and we present a generic discrete-state discrete-action model of such environments. To learn in this environment, we propose an unsupervised reinforcement learning agent called CLIC for Curriculum Learning and Imitation for Control. CLIC learns to control individual objects in its environment, and imitates Bob's interactions with these objects. It selects objects to focus on when training and imitating by maximizing its learning progress. We show that CLIC is an effective baseline in our new setting. It can effectively observe Bob to gain control of objects faster, even if Bob is not explicitly teaching. It can also follow Bob when he acts as a mentor and provides ordered demonstrations. Finally, when Bob controls objects that the agent cannot, or in presence of a hierarchy between objects in the environment, we show that CLIC ignores non-reproducible and already mastered interactions with objects, resulting in a greater benefit from imitation.",0
"Successful robotic manipulation tasks require efficient exploration strategies that allow robots to learn new skills by interacting with their environment. In many cases, existing methods rely on explicit feedback signals such as rewards or kinematic demonstrations to guide learning. However, these signals may not always be available or reliable, making it challenging to acquire complex behaviors. To address this issue, we propose CLIC (Curriculum Learning and Imitation for Object Control), a novel approach that leverages curriculum learning and imitation techniques to enable robots to efficiently explore and learn from non-rewarding environments without the need for explicit feedback.  CLIC consists of two main components: a self-supervised learning module and a behavioral cloning module. Firstly, the self-supervised learning module enables the robot to discover underlying patterns in sensor data through exploration. This stage provides the robot with an initial set of learned behaviors, which can then be fine-tuned using imitation learning. Secondly, the behavioral cloning module utilizes the previously discovered patterns as a reference for learning new behaviors. By combining both self-supervised learning and behavioral cloning, CLIC effectively reduces sample complexity and allows for faster adaptation to new situations.  Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple manipulation tasks in real-world settings. Our results show significant improvements over baseline methods and highlight the potential benefits of integrating self-supervised and imitation learning approaches in non-rewarding environments. Overall, CLIC represents a promising step towards developing efficient and adaptive robotics systems capable of performing complex tasks under diverse environmental conditions.",1
"With a single eye fixation lasting a fraction of a second, the human visual system is capable of forming a rich representation of a complex environment, reaching a holistic understanding which facilitates object recognition and detection. This phenomenon is known as recognizing the ""gist"" of the scene and is accomplished by relying on relevant prior knowledge. This paper addresses the analogous question of whether using memory in computer vision systems can not only improve the accuracy of object detection in video streams, but also reduce the computation time. By interleaving conventional feature extractors with extremely lightweight ones which only need to recognize the gist of the scene, we show that minimal computation is required to produce accurate detections when temporal memory is present. In addition, we show that the memory contains enough information for deploying reinforcement learning algorithms to learn an adaptive inference policy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among mobile methods on the Imagenet VID 2015 dataset, while running at speeds of up to 70+ FPS on a Pixel 3 phone.",0
"In recent years, video object detection has become one of the most popular computer vision applications due to advancements in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). As devices become more powerful, memory usage becomes less of an issue, allowing larger models to be run on mobile platforms. However, these large models come at the cost of increased latency and reduced accuracy in cases where they must operate under tight computational constraints. This paper proposes an effective solution that combines the strengths of both fast and slow models by utilizing a hybrid approach. Specifically, we use Faster R-CNN as our ""slow"" model to provide accurate detections, while RetinaNet is used as our ""fast"" model which runs quickly but sacrifices some accuracy. We then fuse their predictions using a late fusion strategy, which further improves overall performance without significantly increasing computation time. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of speed, accuracy, and tradeoff analysis, making it suitable for real-world deployment scenarios on resource-constrained devices. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on how to balance the competing goals of accuracy and efficiency in mobile video object detection tasks.",1
"Efficient exploration remains a major challenge for reinforcement learning. One reason is that the variability of the returns often depends on the current state and action, and is therefore heteroscedastic. Classical exploration strategies such as upper confidence bound algorithms and Thompson sampling fail to appropriately account for heteroscedasticity, even in the bandit setting. Motivated by recent findings that address this issue in bandits, we propose to use Information-Directed Sampling (IDS) for exploration in reinforcement learning. As our main contribution, we build on recent advances in distributional reinforcement learning and propose a novel, tractable approximation of IDS for deep Q-learning. The resulting exploration strategy explicitly accounts for both parametric uncertainty and heteroscedastic observation noise. We evaluate our method on Atari games and demonstrate a significant improvement over alternative approaches.",0
"Title: ""Exploring Deeper: An Efficient Approach to Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex problems by training agents to make decisions based on rewards received from interacting with their environment. However, exploring the vast space of actions in these environments can be challenging due to limited experience and uncertainty about which actions lead to high reward. In this work, we propose a novel approach to DRL that efficiently directs agent exploration using past experiences stored in a tabular memory buffer. By leveraging information gained from previously observed transitions, our method enables the agent to focus its search on regions of state space more likely to yield high returns. We evaluate our algorithm across several benchmark tasks and show consistent improvements over traditional methods in terms of sample efficiency and final performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of information-directed exploration in enhancing the robustness and scalability of DRL models.",1
"Using reinforcement learning to learn control policies is a challenge when the task is complex with potentially long horizons. Ensuring adequate but safe exploration is also crucial for controlling physical systems. In this paper, we use temporal logic to facilitate specification and learning of complex tasks. We combine temporal logic with control Lyapunov functions to improve exploration. We incorporate control barrier functions to safeguard the exploration and deployment process. We develop a flexible and learnable system that allows users to specify task objectives and constraints in different forms and at various levels. The framework is also able to take advantage of known system dynamics and handle unknown environmental dynamics by integrating model-free learning with model-based planning.",0
"This paper presents a method for safe reinforcement learning using control barrier functions guided by temporal logic specifications. We use a learnable adaptive controller that learns while ensuring safety through control barrier functions and enforcing desired logical properties via linear temporal logics (LTL). Our approach utilizes robust control barrier functions from differential inclusions with time varying uncertainties. These allow us to develop more general and flexible conditions compared to previous work. To achieve safety certification under uncertainty, we introduce a novel adaptive mechanism which enables our system to account for new learned constraints without retraining. By combining these components, we provide a framework capable of real-time decision making for complex environments like autonomous driving systems. Simulation results demonstrate improved efficiency and adaptability over baseline methods such as model predictive control (MPC) on benchmark continuous-control problems and a high-dimensional car following scenario involving human driver interactions. Additionally, we perform experiments with real robot hardware to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed approach in practice.",1
"Direct policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning and continuous control problems are a popular approach for a variety of reasons: 1) they are easy to implement without explicit knowledge of the underlying model 2) they are an ""end-to-end"" approach, directly optimizing the performance metric of interest 3) they inherently allow for richly parameterized policies. A notable drawback is that even in the most basic continuous control problem (that of linear quadratic regulators), these methods must solve a non-convex optimization problem, where little is understood about their efficiency from both computational and statistical perspectives. In contrast, system identification and model based planning in optimal control theory have a much more solid theoretical footing, where much is known with regards to their computational and statistical properties. This work bridges this gap showing that (model free) policy gradient methods globally converge to the optimal solution and are efficient (polynomially so in relevant problem dependent quantities) with regards to their sample and computational complexities.",0
"In recent years, policy gradient methods have become increasingly popular as efficient algorithms for solving reinforcement learning problems. These methods use a feedback parameterization that makes them amenable to global convergence analysis under mild conditions on the problem structure. This paper focuses on analyzing the global convergence properties of policy gradient methods for linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, which represent a class of control problems characterized by a quadratic cost function and linear dynamics. Our main result establishes global convergence of policy gradient algorithms to optimal policies for LQR problems under standard assumptions such as controllability and strong convexity/strict concavity of the value function. We provide explicit error bounds that depend only on model parameters, initial iterates, and algorithm hyperparameters such as step size and batch size. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, our work sheds light on the convergent behavior of policy gradient algorithms for linear quadratic regulators and provides insights into their performance in practice.",1
"Reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to optimally solve dynamic decision-making and control problems. With continuous-valued state and input variables, reinforcement learning algorithms must rely on function approximators to represent the value function and policy mappings. Commonly used numerical approximators, such as neural networks or basis function expansions, have two main drawbacks: they are black-box models offering no insight in the mappings learned, and they require significant trial and error tuning of their meta-parameters. In this paper, we propose a new approach to constructing smooth value functions by means of symbolic regression. We introduce three off-line methods for finding value functions based on a state transition model: symbolic value iteration, symbolic policy iteration, and a direct solution of the Bellman equation. The methods are illustrated on four nonlinear control problems: velocity control under friction, one-link and two-link pendulum swing-up, and magnetic manipulation. The results show that the value functions not only yield well-performing policies, but also are compact, human-readable and mathematically tractable. This makes them potentially suitable for further analysis of the closed-loop system. A comparison with alternative approaches using neural networks shows that our method constructs well-performing value functions with substantially fewer parameters.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence, symbolic regression has been shown to be an effective method for learning sequential decision making policies that can achieve high performance across multiple domains, including robotics and control systems.

This paper presents a review of current symbolic regression techniques used in conjunction with deep reinforcement learning to produce more accurate and efficient models that outperform traditional approaches. We examine state-of-the-art applications in areas such as game playing, autonomous driving, and control system design and discuss the benefits and limitations of each approach.

"In complex transfer learning scenarios new tasks might not be tightly linked to previous tasks. Approaches that transfer information contained only in the final parameters of a source model will therefore struggle. Instead, transfer learning at a higher level of abstraction is needed. We propose Leap, a framework that achieves this by transferring knowledge across learning processes. We associate each task with a manifold on which the training process travels from initialization to final parameters and construct a meta-learning objective that minimizes the expected length of this path. Our framework leverages only information obtained during training and can be computed on the fly at negligible cost. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods, both in meta-learning and transfer learning, on a set of computer vision tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that Leap can transfer knowledge across learning processes in demanding reinforcement learning environments (Atari) that involve millions of gradient steps.",0

Michon, M.A. Greywall & C.E. Warren (Eds.) *Berkeley*CA Wiley In response to recent studies questioning whether transfer occurs across learning processes or if knowledge gained is specific to initial training context; we propose that there may indeed by transference as long as both tasks have some commonality even at lower levels like simple feature detection. We used four different experiments where subjects trained on visual discrimination task using sequential or simultaneous presentations were then tested either on same or new stimuli type but still visually presented. Results suggest subjects could generalize learned knowledge beyond their original training context despite differences in conditions. Additionally, all participants showed comparable performance when retested over two week delay. Overall findings support existence of transfer though perhaps limited to basic level features which may still constitute foundation for more complex cognitive abilities. Our results highlight importance of considering similarity among different types of tasks to better assess potential for transfer in applied settings such as education, workforce development and clinical treatments.

"The recommender system is an important form of intelligent application, which assists users to alleviate from information redundancy. Among the metrics used to evaluate a recommender system, the metric of conversion has become more and more important. The majority of existing recommender systems perform poorly on the metric of conversion due to its extremely sparse feedback signal. To tackle this challenge, we propose a deep hierarchical reinforcement learning based recommendation framework, which consists of two components, i.e., high-level agent and low-level agent. The high-level agent catches long-term sparse conversion signals, and automatically sets abstract goals for low-level agent, while the low-level agent follows the abstract goals and interacts with real-time environment. To solve the inherent problem in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm via multi-goals abstraction (HRL-MG). Our proposed algorithm contains three characteristics: 1) the high-level agent generates multiple goals to guide the low-level agent in different stages, which reduces the difficulty of approaching high-level goals; 2) different goals share the same state encoder parameters, which increases the update frequency of the high-level agent and thus accelerates the convergence of our proposed algorithm; 3) an appreciate benefit assignment function is designed to allocate rewards in each goal so as to coordinate different goals in a consistent direction. We evaluate our proposed algorithm based on a real-world e-commerce dataset and validate its effectiveness.",0
"In many recommendation systems today, users can provide multiple goals (e.g., finding new items similar to a given one while minimizing redundancy) when seeking personalized recommendations. To address these multi-goal scenarios, we propose deep hierarchical reinforcement learning based recommendations by incorporating multiple levels of abstractions of goals that model both user preferences and item characteristics. Our approach models each goal as a subproblem represented by an MDP and optimizes all subproblems simultaneously in a hierarchical manner using our proposed HRL algorithm. We evaluate our method on five benchmark datasets spanning different domains ranging from movies to products, and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods under varying evaluation metrics. By explicitly capturing complex relationships among user preferences and item attributes through nested MDP representations, our approach effectively balances exploration/exploitation tradeoffs for more accurate personalization in realistic application settings.",1
"We propose Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with model-based exploration, an algorithm combining both model-free and model-based approaches that explores better and learns environments with sparse rewards more efficiently. DQN is a general-purpose, model-free algorithm and has been proven to perform well in a variety of tasks including Atari 2600 games since it's first proposed by Minh et el. However, like many other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, DQN suffers from poor sample efficiency when rewards are sparse in an environment. As a result, most of the transitions stored in the replay memory have no informative reward signal, and provide limited value to the convergence and training of the Q-Network. However, one insight is that these transitions can be used to learn the dynamics of the environment as a supervised learning problem. The transitions also provide information of the distribution of visited states. Our algorithm utilizes these two observations to perform a one-step planning during exploration to pick an action that leads to states least likely to be seen, thus improving the performance of exploration. We demonstrate our agent's performance in two classic environments with sparse rewards in OpenAI gym: Mountain Car and Lunar Lander.",0
"This is a pretty standard Deep RL algorithm, but is capable of finding good policies quickly even under complex dynamics without using explicit model knowledge beyond the Q values that result from interacting with the environment. However, since there is no guarantee that model errors won’t accumulate over time, you should test your agent thoroughly before deploying! You may need additional mechanisms such as data augmentation (randomizing the environment) or a mix-in policy improvement step like CPO / TD3+BC. Model ensembling can also be used to improve performance by averaging across several models. We tested our approach extensively across Atari games as well as MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our code is publicly available at github link.",1
"In this paper, we propose a distributed off-policy actor critic method to solve multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. Specifically, we assume that all agents keep local estimates of the global optimal policy parameter and update their local value function estimates independently. Then, we introduce an additional consensus step to let all the agents asymptotically achieve agreement on the global optimal policy function. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated using a distributed resource allocation example. Compared to relevant distributed actor critic methods, here the agents do not share information about their local tasks, but instead they coordinate to estimate the global policy function.",0
"Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently gained popularity due to their ability to scale up RL training to large state spaces. While existing distributed RL methods can handle parallelization across multiple agents, they often require individual policies that learn independently, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. To address these limitations, we propose Distributed Off-Policy Actor-Critic RL with Policy Consensus (DOPAC), a novel approach that leverages policy consensus techniques to coordinate and consolidate agent policies during distributed training. Our method ensures global consistency among individual policy updates by maintaining a shared model across all agents, enabling efficient communication and coordination of learned knowledge. We evaluate our algorithm on several benchmark problems and demonstrate significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods in terms of both convergence time and final policy quality. DOPAC provides an effective solution towards scalability in multi-agent systems while minimizing tradeoffs between efficiency and optimality.

"Multi-task learning, as it is understood nowadays, consists of using one single model to carry out several similar tasks. From classifying hand-written characters of different alphabets to figuring out how to play several Atari games using reinforcement learning, multi-task models have been able to widen their performance range across different tasks, although these tasks are usually of a similar nature. In this work, we attempt to widen this range even further, by including heterogeneous tasks in a single learning procedure. To do so, we firstly formally define a multi-network model, identifying the necessary components and characteristics to allow different adaptations of said model depending on the tasks it is required to fulfill. Secondly, employing the formal definition as a starting point, we develop an illustrative model example consisting of three different tasks (classification, regression and data sampling). The performance of this model implementation is then analyzed, showing its capabilities. Motivated by the results of the analysis, we enumerate a set of open challenges and future research lines over which the full potential of the proposed model definition can be exploited.",0

Our experiments show that both approaches outperform single-domain baselines and are competitive with state-of-the-art multi-task systems trained separately on each domain. Additionally, we provide analysis on the relationship between task similarity and performance improvement through joint training. Overall, our work advances towards automating the design process for building effective multimodal models, which could enable new applications like personal assistants capable of handling diverse user requests seamlessly.",1
"Deep Q-Learning (DQL), a family of temporal difference algorithms for control, employs three techniques collectively known as the `deadly triad' in reinforcement learning: bootstrapping, off-policy learning, and function approximation. Prior work has demonstrated that together these can lead to divergence in Q-learning algorithms, but the conditions under which divergence occurs are not well-understood. In this note, we give a simple analysis based on a linear approximation to the Q-value updates, which we believe provides insight into divergence under the deadly triad. The central point in our analysis is to consider when the leading order approximation to the deep-Q update is or is not a contraction in the sup norm. Based on this analysis, we develop an algorithm which permits stable deep Q-learning for continuous control without any of the tricks conventionally used (such as target networks, adaptive gradient optimizers, or using multiple Q functions). We demonstrate that our algorithm performs above or near state-of-the-art on standard MuJoCo benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym.",0
"Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning: From Theory to Practice Author(s): Joel Veness, Tom Schaul, Kelsey Allen Abstract Since their introduction, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of problems including games, robotics, finance, natural language processing, recommendations, and more. In this tutorial we aim to give the reader a comprehensive overview of DRL from both theoretical and applied perspectives. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts such as Markov decision processes (MDP), dynamic programming, value iteration, policy gradients, actor-critic methods, Monte Carlo tree search, and explore how these ideas can be scaled up using neural networks. Next, we delve into some popular contemporary approaches to DRL such as proximal policy optimization (PPO), actor-critic models with experience replay, hierarchical RL, and continuous control with deterministic policies. To complement the theory, we provide code examples throughout which illustrate common use cases and pitfalls encountered during application deployment at scale. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of machine learning and computer science principles but requires no prior exposure to DRL specifically.

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found limited success beyond simulated applications, and one main reason is the absence of safety guarantees during the learning process. Real world systems would realistically fail or break before an optimal controller can be learned. To address this issue, we propose a controller architecture that combines (1) a model-free RL-based controller with (2) model-based controllers utilizing control barrier functions (CBFs) and (3) on-line learning of the unknown system dynamics, in order to ensure safety during learning. Our general framework leverages the success of RL algorithms to learn high-performance controllers, while the CBF-based controllers both guarantee safety and guide the learning process by constraining the set of explorable polices. We utilize Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and its uncertainties.   Our novel controller synthesis algorithm, RL-CBF, guarantees safety with high probability during the learning process, regardless of the RL algorithm used, and demonstrates greater policy exploration efficiency. We test our algorithm on (1) control of an inverted pendulum and (2) autonomous car-following with wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and show that our algorithm attains much greater sample efficiency in learning than other state-of-the-art algorithms and maintains safety during the entire learning process.",0
"In modern times there has been an increasing focus on developing autonomous systems that can perform tasks without human intervention. However, ensuring these systems remain safe requires careful consideration due to their safety-critical nature. Recent advances have introduced end-to-end safe reinforcement learning (SRL) as a means of addressing this challenge by providing formal guarantees of stability and robustness. This study proposes a novel method for SRL using barrier functions that enable continuous control tasks while maintaining safety constraints. The approach presented demonstrates promising results compared to existing methods. Further research is required to fully explore the potential benefits but early indications show great promise towards achieving reliable and autonomous systems in safety-critical applications.",1
"When learning policies for real-world domains, two important questions arise: (i) how to efficiently use pre-collected off-policy, non-optimal behavior data; and (ii) how to mediate among different competing objectives and constraints. We thus study the problem of batch policy learning under multiple constraints, and offer a systematic solution. We first propose a flexible meta-algorithm that admits any batch reinforcement learning and online learning procedure as subroutines. We then present a specific algorithmic instantiation and provide performance guarantees for the main objective and all constraints. To certify constraint satisfaction, we propose a new and simple method for off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) and derive PAC-style bounds. Our algorithm achieves strong empirical results in different domains, including in a challenging problem of simulated car driving subject to multiple constraints such as lane keeping and smooth driving. We also show experimentally that our OPE method outperforms other popular OPE techniques on a standalone basis, especially in a high-dimensional setting.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm for solving discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs) with batch policy learning from constraints. We focus on problems where agents need to learn policies that satisfy certain constraints on their behavior, such as safety requirements or performance guarantees. Our approach combines online batch policy updates with model-based value estimates to efficiently search for feasible solutions. By using a model-free update rule based on constraint violations, we can ensure that learned policies improve monotonically over time while satisfying the given constraints. We show experimental results demonstrating that our method outperforms both model-free and model-based baselines across a range of constrained MDP tasks. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis showing that our algorithm converges faster than existing methods under suitable conditions. Overall, our work contributes to the development of more efficient and effective algorithms for constrained reinforcement learning in real-world applications.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms require large amounts of experience to learn an individual task. While in principle meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms enable agents to learn new skills from small amounts of experience, several major challenges preclude their practicality. Current methods rely heavily on on-policy experience, limiting their sample efficiency. The also lack mechanisms to reason about task uncertainty when adapting to new tasks, limiting their effectiveness in sparse reward problems. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing an off-policy meta-RL algorithm that disentangles task inference and control. In our approach, we perform online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience. This probabilistic interpretation enables posterior sampling for structured and efficient exploration. We demonstrate how to integrate these task variables with off-policy RL algorithms to achieve both meta-training and adaptation efficiency. Our method outperforms prior algorithms in sample efficiency by 20-100X as well as in asymptotic performance on several meta-RL benchmarks.",0

"Compared to reinforcement learning, imitation learning (IL) is a powerful paradigm for training agents to learn control policies efficiently from expert demonstrations. However, in most cases, obtaining demonstration data is costly and laborious, which poses a significant challenge in some scenarios. A promising alternative is to train agent learning skills via imitation learning without expert demonstrations, which, to some extent, would extremely expand imitation learning areas. To achieve such expectation, in this paper, we propose Hindsight Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (HGAIL) algorithm, with the aim of achieving imitation learning satisfying no need of demonstrations. Combining hindsight idea with the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) framework, we realize implementing imitation learning successfully in cases of expert demonstration data are not available. Experiments show that the proposed method can train policies showing comparable performance to current imitation learning methods. Further more, HGAIL essentially endows curriculum learning mechanism which is critical for learning policies.",0
"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have led to the development of algorithms capable of solving complex sequential decision making problems to a superhuman level. One such algorithm is Deep Q Networks (DQN) which uses a neural network to estimate the expected future reward as a function of state, action pairs. However, DQN suffers from some limitations such as high variance in performance due to random initialization and overestimation of value functions that leads to suboptimal policies. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (HGAIL), a new model-free imitation learning approach that addresses these limitations by combining hindsight experience replay and generative adversarial imitation learning techniques. Our method utilizes two competing neural networks: a generator G that generates expert demonstrations by starting from given states and performing actions greedily according to the current policy, and a discriminator D that evaluates whether generated trajectories match real ones from the expert. We train our models using a combination of behavior cloning loss and binary cross entropy loss. Experiments on continuous control tasks show significant improvement over previous methods, achieving lower regret while matching or exceeding their performance. Overall, our proposed framework provides a promising direction towards developing more efficient and effective machine learning systems capable of reaching human-level performance in complex domains.",1
"This report first provides a brief overview of a number of supervised learning algorithms for regression tasks. Among those are neural networks, regression trees, and the recently introduced Nexting. Nexting has been presented in the context of reinforcement learning where it was used to predict a large number of signals at different timescales. In the second half of this report, we apply the algorithms to historical weather data in order to evaluate their suitability to forecast a local weather trend. Our experiments did not identify one clearly preferable method, but rather show that choosing an appropriate algorithm depends on the available side information. For slowly varying signals and a proficient number of training samples, Nexting achieved good results in the studied cases.",0
This study compares two different approaches for short term weather forecasting: prediction algorithms and nexting. These methods have been applied in the past but their accuracy has yet to be compared in a comprehensive manner. In this work we use data from multiple sources and evaluate how well these two methods perform in predicting temperature and precipitation levels. We find that while both methods have strengths and weaknesses they differ significantly in their level of complexity and requirements. Our analysis provides insights into which method might be more suitable depending on specific application needs.,1
"In model-based reinforcement learning, the agent interleaves between model learning and planning. These two components are inextricably intertwined. If the model is not able to provide sensible long-term prediction, the executed planner would exploit model flaws, which can yield catastrophic failures. This paper focuses on building a model that reasons about the long-term future and demonstrates how to use this for efficient planning and exploration. To this end, we build a latent-variable autoregressive model by leveraging recent ideas in variational inference. We argue that forcing latent variables to carry future information through an auxiliary task substantially improves long-term predictions. Moreover, by planning in the latent space, the planner's solution is ensured to be within regions where the model is valid. An exploration strategy can be devised by searching for unlikely trajectories under the model. Our method achieves higher reward faster compared to baselines on a variety of tasks and environments in both the imitation learning and model-based reinforcement learning settings.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress made in deep reinforcement learning (RL) based on actor-critic methods. One such method is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which uses the KL divergence as regularizer. While PPO has achieved success in many domains, it can struggle to handle sparse rewards and may lead to policies that focus excessively on short term reward maximization at the expense of ignoring longer term consequences. To address these challenges, we propose a new model called the Learning Dynamics Model (LDM). LDM combines the use of a recurrent neural network with an off-policy objective function that takes into account future discounted return expected under the current policy. Through simulation studies, our results show that the proposed LDM outperforms several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in handling tasks with sparse rewards, while also achieving better performance in terms of average reward across all task types tested. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using long term considerations in improving the performance of deep RL agents. Additionally, due to the simplicity of the architecture used in this study, further modifications and improvements can be added easily to enhance performance even more. Overall, these findings contribute to advancing the field of RL towards developing agents able to learn optimal behavior incorporating long term considerations effectively, opening up potential applications to real world problems where understanding of longer term impacts is crucial.",1

By supporting more flexible experimentation through easy reuse and modification of scenario setups, AI2- THOR has the potential to accelerate both academic research and industrial innovation in computer vision and other applications of AI to the study of interactions between natural and synthetic agents.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved breakthrough results on many tasks, but agents often fail to generalize beyond the environment they were trained in. As a result, deep RL algorithms that promote generalization are receiving increasing attention. However, works in this area use a wide variety of tasks and experimental setups for evaluation. The literature lacks a controlled assessment of the merits of different generalization schemes. Our aim is to catalyze community-wide progress on generalization in deep RL. To this end, we present a benchmark and experimental protocol, and conduct a systematic empirical study. Our framework contains a diverse set of environments, our methodology covers both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization, and our evaluation includes deep RL algorithms that specifically tackle generalization. Our key finding is that `vanilla' deep RL algorithms generalize better than specialized schemes that were proposed specifically to tackle generalization.",0

"Multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) have been demonstrated on complex tasks that require the coordination of a team of multiple agents to complete. Existing works have focused on sharing information between agents via centralized critics to stabilize learning or through communication to increase performance, but do not generally look at how information can be shared between agents to address the curse of dimensionality in MARL. We posit that a multiagent problem can be decomposed into a multi-task problem where each agent explores a subset of the state space instead of exploring the entire state space. This paper introduces a multiagent actor-critic algorithm and method for combining knowledge from homogeneous agents through distillation and value-matching that outperforms policy distillation alone and allows further learning in both discrete and continuous action spaces.",0
"In multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), policy distillation refers to the process by which policies learned by individual agents can be combined into one global policy that jointly maximizes the overall return across all agents. Value matching is another method used in MARL that involves training each agent separately to optimize local values that match those of other agents at steady state. This paper investigates how these two methods can be combined to create more effective algorithms for collaborative decision making in complex environments where multiple agents interact. The authors evaluate their approach on a variety of tasks and demonstrate that their hybrid algorithm outperforms both pure policy distillation and value matching approaches alone. They provide insights into why combining these methods leads to better performance and discuss future directions for research in MARL. Overall, this work has important implications for developing artificial intelligence systems that can effectively coordinate the actions of multiple agents in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and smart cities.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning has enabled the control of increasingly complex and high-dimensional problems. However, the need of vast amounts of data before reasonable performance is attained prevents its widespread application. We employ binary corrective feedback as a general and intuitive manner to incorporate human intuition and domain knowledge in model-free machine learning. The uncertainty in the policy and the corrective feedback is combined directly in the action space as probabilistic conditional exploration. As a result, the greatest part of the otherwise ignorant learning process can be avoided. We demonstrate the proposed method, Predictive Probabilistic Merging of Policies (PPMP), in combination with DDPG. In experiments on continuous control problems of the OpenAI Gym, we achieve drastic improvements in sample efficiency, final performance, and robustness to erroneous feedback, both for human and synthetic feedback. Additionally, we show solutions beyond the demonstrated knowledge.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex decision making problems. However, most DRL algorithms suffer from slow convergence rates due to the high dimensionality of the state space, which makes exploring the environment challenging. This study proposes a new method called ""feedback-based exploration"" that leverages human feedback on the agent's decisions to encourage efficient exploration during training. By using real-time feedback from humans, the proposed method can significantly reduce the number of interactions required to learn optimal policies compared to traditional methods based solely on intrinsic rewards. Experiments conducted on multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating DRL. We believe this research opens up exciting opportunities for developing agents that can efficiently interact with their environments while incorporating insights from users.",1
"Inferring a person's goal from their behavior is an important problem in applications of AI (e.g. automated assistants, recommender systems). The workhorse model for this task is the rational actor model - this amounts to assuming that people have stable reward functions, discount the future exponentially, and construct optimal plans. Under the rational actor assumption techniques such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) can be used to infer a person's goals from their actions. A competing model is the dual-system model. Here decisions are the result of an interplay between a fast, automatic, heuristic-based system 1 and a slower, deliberate, calculating system 2. We generalize the dual system framework to the case of Markov decision problems and show how to compute optimal plans for dual-system agents. We show that dual-system agents exhibit behaviors that are incompatible with rational actor assumption. We show that naive applications of rational-actor IRL to the behavior of dual-system agents can generate wrong inference about the agents' goals and suggest interventions that actually reduce the agent's overall utility. Finally, we adapt a simple IRL algorithm to correctly infer the goals of dual system decision-makers. This allows us to make interventions that help, rather than hinder, the dual-system agent's ability to reach their true goals.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework that allows agents to learn from trial and error by maximizing cumulative reward. However, traditional RL algorithms often struggle with complex tasks that require strategic reasoning and the ability to handle uncertain situations. To overcome these limitations, we propose using system 1 and system 2 thinking models inspired by human cognition. Our approach combines insights from both reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), allowing us to model strategic decision making as well as inference of preferences based on observed behavior. Through experiments on benchmark problems, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both discrete and continuous action spaces. Furthermore, analysis shows that our method captures different components of the value function which can be used in applications such as game design or policy evaluation. Overall, our work extends existing RL frameworks towards more sophisticated real-world scenarios while remaining computationally efficient enough to run on modern hardware.",1
"We propose a new low-cost machine-learning-based methodology which assists designers in reducing the gap between the problem and the solution in the design process. Our work applies reinforcement learning (RL) to find the optimal task-oriented design solution through the construction of the design action for each task. For this task-oriented design, the 3D design process in product design is assigned to an action space in Deep RL, and the desired 3D model is obtained by training each design action according to the task. By showing that this method achieves satisfactory design even when applied to a task pursuing multiple goals, we suggest the direction of how machine learning can contribute to the design process. Also, we have validated with product designers that this methodology can assist the creative part in the process of design.",0
"This paper presents an approach to task-oriented design that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches to task-oriented design often require extensive hand-engineering of features and rewards, which can lead to brittle and suboptimal designs. In contrast, our method uses RL to learn both features and rewards automatically from raw sensory input data, enabling more robust and efficient designs. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several challenging tasks across different domains, including robot manipulation, natural language understanding, and video game playing. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on all benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL as a powerful tool for generating high-performance task-oriented systems.",1
"How do we know if communication is emerging in a multi-agent system? The vast majority of recent papers on emergent communication show that adding a communication channel leads to an increase in reward or task success. This is a useful indicator, but provides only a coarse measure of the agent's learned communication abilities. As we move towards more complex environments, it becomes imperative to have a set of finer tools that allow qualitative and quantitative insights into the emergence of communication. This may be especially useful to allow humans to monitor agents' behaviour, whether for fault detection, assessing performance, or even building trust. In this paper, we examine a few intuitive existing metrics for measuring communication, and show that they can be misleading. Specifically, by training deep reinforcement learning agents to play simple matrix games augmented with a communication channel, we find a scenario where agents appear to communicate (their messages provide information about their subsequent action), and yet the messages do not impact the environment or other agent in any way. We explain this phenomenon using ablation studies and by visualizing the representations of the learned policies. We also survey some commonly used metrics for measuring emergent communication, and provide recommendations as to when these metrics should be used.",0
"""Measuring communication within human groups has become increasingly important as technology continues to advance. In recent years, researchers have turned to studying emergent communication, which occurs spontaneously within groups without explicit guidance or planning. However, measuring such communication can pose significant challenges due to its informal nature and lack of structure. This paper examines these pitfalls and offers suggestions on how future studies can improve their measurement methods.""",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to address a variety of cooperative multi-agent problems with either discrete action spaces or continuous action spaces. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has ever succeeded in applying DRL to multi-agent problems with discrete-continuous hybrid (or parameterized) action spaces which is very common in practice. Our work fills this gap by proposing two novel algorithms: Deep Multi-Agent Parameterized Q-Networks (Deep MAPQN) and Deep Multi-Agent Hierarchical Hybrid Q-Networks (Deep MAHHQN). We follow the centralized training but decentralized execution paradigm: different levels of communication between different agents are used to facilitate the training process, while each agent executes its policy independently based on local observations during execution. Our empirical results on several challenging tasks (simulated RoboCup Soccer and game Ghost Story) show that both Deep MAPQN and Deep MAHHQN are effective and significantly outperform existing independent deep parameterized Q-learning method.",0
"Recent advancements in deep learning have made multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) increasingly popular as a tool for solving complex problems that involve multiple interacting agents. However, many real-world scenarios feature action spaces that cannot be fully discretized into individual actions, but rather consist of continuous components along with discrete ones. To address this challenge, we propose using hybrid action representations in MARL algorithms by combining both continuous and discrete dimensions. Our approach allows for more expressive representations while still preserving efficient exploration strategies common in traditional discrete MARL formulations. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks from different domains and demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods with hybrid action spaces. This study shows promising results towards extending MARL applications beyond the scope of purely discrete action sets and paves the way for new problem classes where combined action spaces can lead to better solutions.",1
"We present a deep reinforcement learning method of progressive view inpainting for 3D point scene completion under volume guidance, achieving high-quality scene reconstruction from only a single depth image with severe occlusion. Our approach is end-to-end, consisting of three modules: 3D scene volume reconstruction, 2D depth map inpainting, and multi-view selection for completion. Given a single depth image, our method first goes through the 3D volume branch to obtain a volumetric scene reconstruction as a guide to the next view inpainting step, which attempts to make up the missing information; the third step involves projecting the volume under the same view of the input, concatenating them to complete the current view depth, and integrating all depth into the point cloud. Since the occluded areas are unavailable, we resort to a deep Q-Network to glance around and pick the next best view for large hole completion progressively until a scene is adequately reconstructed while guaranteeing validity. All steps are learned jointly to achieve robust and consistent results. We perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations with extensive experiments on the SUNCG data, obtaining better results than the state of the art.",0
"In this work we present DPVIP, a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that leverages volume guidance for viewpoint inpainting on 3D point scenes. Using only single depth images as input data, our system can generate high quality and consistent views by filling occluded regions progressively across frames based on real scene geometry constraints. Our framework consists of two key components: a progressive generative network trained via RLHF for generating intermediate views and dense correspondences between depth maps; and a variational autoencoder with attention mechanism used to regularize the training process by minimizing reconstruction error against ground truth depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, while running at interactive speeds (<20ms). With flexible architecture design, DPVIP also allows fine-grained control over the tradeoff between accuracy and speed. This paves the way towards many future applications such as interactive 360 degree video generation, VR/AR systems and robotic manipulation planning under uncertainty where precise 3D shape understanding is essential. Overall, our research makes a significant step forward in advancing computational imaging capabilities to recover accurate 3D structures from raw visual inputs like monocular videos and potentially other sensor modalities with even less constraints.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, and deep neural networks further enhance its learning power. However, centralized RL is infeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by distributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new challenges: now the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint of each local agent due to limited communication among agents. Most existing studies in MARL focus on designing efficient communication and coordination among traditional Q-learning agents. This paper presents, for the first time, a fully scalable and decentralized MARL algorithm for the state-of-the-art deep RL agent: advantage actor critic (A2C), within the context of ATSC. In particular, two methods are proposed to stabilize the learning procedure, by improving the observability and reducing the learning difficulty of each local agent. The proposed multi-agent A2C is compared against independent A2C and independent Q-learning algorithms, in both a large synthetic traffic grid and a large real-world traffic network of Monaco city, under simulated peak-hour traffic dynamics. Results demonstrate its optimality, robustness, and sample efficiency over other state-of-the-art decentralized MARL algorithms.",0
"This paper presents a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach to improve traffic signal control at intersections. We propose using deep neural networks to model the decision-making process for each agent, which represents one lane at the intersection. Our method allows agents to make decisions based on their own local observations as well as global information shared by other agents. By doing so, we aim to reduce waiting times, decrease fuel consumption, and enhance safety levels for drivers. We evaluate our proposed method through simulations using real-world traffic data and compare its performance against state-of-the-art traffic light control algorithms. Results show that our method achieves significant improvements in terms of average travel time reduction, delay mitigation, and smoother traffic flow overall. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning techniques in designing effective large-scale traffic signal control systems.",1
"Machine learning, especially deep neural networks, has been rapidly developed in fields including computer vision, speech recognition and reinforcement learning. Although Mini-batch SGD is one of the most popular stochastic optimization methods in training deep networks, it shows a slow convergence rate due to the large noise in gradient approximation. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this problem by building more efficient batch selection method based on typicality sampling, which reduces the error of gradient estimation in conventional Minibatch SGD. We analyze the convergence rate of the resulting typical batch SGD algorithm and compare convergence properties between Minibatch SGD and the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our batch selection scheme works well and more complex Minibatch SGD variants can benefit from the proposed batch selection strategy.",0
"This paper presents an accelerated version of minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by leveraging typicality sampling.

We evaluate our approach on several benchmark tasks and show consistent improvements over standard SGD. Our results demonstrate that typicality sampling can effectively speed up model training without sacrificing performance accuracy.",1
"Existing imitation learning approaches often require that the complete demonstration data, including sequences of actions and states, are available. In this paper, we consider a more realistic and difficult scenario where a reinforcement learning agent only has access to the state sequences of an expert, while the expert actions are unobserved. We propose a novel tensor-based model to infer the unobserved actions of the expert state sequences. The policy of the agent is then optimized via a hybrid objective combining reinforcement learning and imitation learning. We evaluated our hybrid approach on an illustrative domain and Atari games. The empirical results show that (1) the agents are able to leverage state expert sequences to learn faster than pure reinforcement learning baselines, (2) our tensor-based action inference model is advantageous compared to standard deep neural networks in inferring expert actions, and (3) the hybrid policy optimization objective is robust against noise in expert state sequences.",0
"This hybrid approach uses expert state sequences as rewards for reinforcement learning agents. It combines traditional RL and inverse RL by using human demonstrations and their derived state trajectories. We use these state sequences as additional reward signals to train the agent on real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Additionally, we verify that learned policies transfer well across different environments and achieve higher success rates on challenging dexterous manipulation problems. Our work provides evidence that incorporating human domain knowledge can significantly improve sample efficiency and robustness of deep RL algorithms.",1
"Many robotic applications require the agent to perform long-horizon tasks in partially observable environments. In such applications, decision making at any step can depend on observations received far in the past. Hence, being able to properly memorize and utilize the long-term history is crucial.

The proposed policy embeds and adds each observation to a memory and uses the attention mechanism to exploit spatio-temporal dependencies. This model is generic and can be efficiently trained with reinforcement learning over long episodes. On a range of visual navigation tasks, SMT demonstrates superior performance to existing reactive and memory-based policies by a margin.",0

Through empirical evaluation, SMT demonstrates improved performance compared to traditional methods across several benchmark datasets, including the MultiWOZ task suite for semantic slot filling. With its ability to accurately capture dependencies within and across multiple turns of interaction, our method holds great potential for powering future generations of intelligent virtual assistance systems.",1
"To improve efficiency and reduce failures in autonomous vehicles, research has focused on developing robust and safe learning methods that take into account disturbances in the environment.

"We introduce a multi-agent meta-modeling game to generate data, knowledge, and models that make predictions on constitutive responses of elasto-plastic materials. We introduce a new concept from graph theory where a modeler agent is tasked with evaluating all the modeling options recast as a directed multigraph and find the optimal path that links the source of the directed graph (e.g. strain history) to the target (e.g. stress) measured by an objective function. Meanwhile, the data agent, which is tasked with generating data from real or virtual experiments (e.g. molecular dynamics, discrete element simulations), interacts with the modeling agent sequentially and uses reinforcement learning to design new experiments to optimize the prediction capacity. Consequently, this treatment enables us to emulate an idealized scientific collaboration as selections of the optimal choices in a decision tree search done automatically via deep reinforcement learning.",0

Overall, this study demonstrates how incorporating AI into scientific research processes can lead to significant advancements in fields like materials science, where experts may struggle to make progress without access to cutting-edge technologies. As the pace of innovation continues to accelerate, it will become even more important for scientists to harness AI's capabilities to drive discovery forward. Ultimately, this paper offers valuable insights into potential future directions for this burgeoning field of inquiry.",1
"The game of Chinese Checkers is a challenging traditional board game of perfect information that differs from other traditional games in two main aspects: first, unlike Chess, all checkers remain indefinitely in the game and hence the branching factor of the search tree does not decrease as the game progresses; second, unlike Go, there are also no upper bounds on the depth of the search tree since repetitions and backward movements are allowed. Therefore, even in a restricted game instance, the state-space of the game can still be unbounded, making it challenging for a computer program to excel. In this work, we present an approach that effectively combines the use of heuristics, Monte Carlo tree search, and deep reinforcement learning for building a Chinese Checkers agent without the use of any human game-play data. Experiment results show that our agent is competent under different scenarios and reaches the level of experienced human players.",0

By combining these techniques, we aim to improve the state-of-the-art solution methodologies for two-player perfect information games like Chinese checkers. Our proposed framework first applies heuristic functions to evaluate board positions and guide MCTS exploration towards promising moves. Next, MCTS utilizes rollouts from both human expert moves and moves generated by our deep neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning. We show that our approach achieves strong results compared to existing methods on several benchmark problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hybrid approach. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward in developing intelligent agents capable of tackling challenging real-world decision making tasks.",1
"How can we design safe reinforcement learning agents that avoid unnecessary disruptions to their environment? We show that current approaches to penalizing side effects can introduce bad incentives, e.g. to prevent any irreversible changes in the environment, including the actions of other agents. To isolate the source of such undesirable incentives, we break down side effects penalties into two components: a baseline state and a measure of deviation from this baseline state. We argue that some of these incentives arise from the choice of baseline, and others arise from the choice of deviation measure. We introduce a new variant of the stepwise inaction baseline and a new deviation measure based on relative reachability of states. The combination of these design choices avoids the given undesirable incentives, while simpler baselines and the unreachability measure fail. We demonstrate this empirically by comparing different combinations of baseline and deviation measure choices on a set of gridworld experiments designed to illustrate possible bad incentives.",0

This paper investigates how to tackle these problems by combining deep learning architectures trained via supervised learning techniques with domain knowledge that comes from human experts and statistical analyses. We propose a novel approach called ""stepwise relative reachability"" which allows us to penalize certain kinds of undesirable behaviors (side effects) while optimizing the main goal function. Our method leverages insights from program verification literature to derive bounds on model predictions given specific changes to input variables. These bounds can then be combined into constraints that allow us to guide the optimization process towards desired solutions while discouraging unwanted behavior such as memorized outputs for inputs far outside real-world distributions. Experimental results on popular benchmark datasets show that our proposed method achieves high accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while providing interpretable explanations for important features used by the model during prediction. By explicitly incorporating domain expertise in model design we improve robustness to distribution shifts and outperform prior work in generalization metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework through case studies focused on neurological MRI data where we use physicians’ expert knowledge about artifacts in MRIs to improve image quality assessment accuracy and detection performance respectively. Overall, our study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating problem domain knowledge within machine learnin",1
"Nonlinear optimal control problems are often solved with numerical methods that require knowledge of system's dynamics which may be difficult to infer, and that carry a large computational cost associated with iterative calculations. We present a novel neurobiologically inspired hierarchical learning framework, Reinforcement Learning Optimal Control, which operates on two levels of abstraction and utilises a reduced number of controllers to solve nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics in continuous state and action spaces. Our approach is inspired by research at two levels of abstraction: first, at the level of limb coordination human behaviour is explained by linear optimal feedback control theory. Second, in cognitive tasks involving learning symbolic level action selection, humans learn such problems using model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. We propose that combining these two levels of abstraction leads to a fast global solution of nonlinear control problems using reduced number of controllers. Our framework learns the local task dynamics from naive experience and forms locally optimal infinite horizon Linear Quadratic Regulators which produce continuous low-level control. A top-level reinforcement learner uses the controllers as actions and learns how to best combine them in state space while maximising a long-term reward. A single optimal control objective function drives high-level symbolic learning by providing training signals on desirability of each selected controller. We show that a small number of locally optimal linear controllers are able to solve global nonlinear control problems with unknown dynamics when combined with a reinforcement learner in this hierarchical framework. Our algorithm competes in terms of computational cost and solution quality with sophisticated control algorithms and we illustrate this with solutions to benchmark problems.",0
"This article presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm called RLOC (Recurrent Latent Orthogonal Codes) for continuous control of nonlinear dynamical systems. The algorithm was inspired by neurobiological processes such as synaptic plasticity and neural circuit organization.  RLOC uses temporal difference (TD) error backpropagation through time to learn recurrent latent representations that disambiguate different features of state variables and actions at multiple timescales. These representations form an implicit hierarchical decomposition of the task space, allowing for efficient exploration and rapid learning.  The authors evaluate RLOC on several challenging continuous control tasks, including swingup and balancing of a double pendulum, cartpole control, and acrobot walking. Experimental results demonstrate that RLOC outperforms benchmark methods such as deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG), actor-critic algorithms, and TD learning with eligibility traces. The proposed algorithm achieves superior performance while requiring fewer parameters and computational resources compared to these baseline methods.  In conclusion, the RLOC approach offers a powerful toolkit for model-free, offline-trained reinforcement learning agents capable of solving complex problems that have proven difficult for previous methods. The work contributes important insights into both neuroscience and artificial intelligence research communities, highlighting potential new directions for developing intelligent agents based on biological principles.",1
"Real-world tasks are often highly structured. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has attracted research interest as an approach for leveraging the hierarchical structure of a given task in reinforcement learning (RL). However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that enhances the performance of RL is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an HRL method that learns a latent variable of a hierarchical policy using mutual information maximization. Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling. In our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy. Experimental results indicate that our HRL approach can learn a diversity of options and that it can enhance the performance of RL in continuous control tasks.",0
"This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that maximizes advantage-weighted information return. The algorithm can efficiently solve complex tasks by decomposing them into simpler subtasks and leveraging the knowledge learned from previous experiences across different levels of abstraction. Our approach allows agents to make effective decisions under uncertainty while balancing exploration versus exploitation tradeoffs. We demonstrate our method’s effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark domains where our agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis showing how advantage weighting leads to better generalization performance compared to traditional policy gradient methods. Overall, this work advances the field of reinforcement learning by providing a new perspective on hierarchical decision making based on the notion of informative episodes.",1
"Active vision is inherently attention-driven: The agent actively selects views to attend in order to fast achieve the vision task while improving its internal representation of the scene being observed. Inspired by the recent success of attention-based models in 2D vision tasks based on single RGB images, we propose to address the multi-view depth-based active object recognition using attention mechanism, through developing an end-to-end recurrent 3D attentional network. The architecture takes advantage of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to store and update an internal representation. Our model, trained with 3D shape datasets, is able to iteratively attend to the best views targeting an object of interest for recognizing it. To realize 3D view selection, we derive a 3D spatial transformer network which is differentiable for training with backpropagation, achieving much faster convergence than the reinforcement learning employed by most existing attention-based models. Experiments show that our method, with only depth input, achieves state-of-the-art next-best-view performance in time efficiency and recognition accuracy.",0
"In recent years there has been rapid progress in image recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have limitations such as translational invariance which causes them to ignore important spatial features. Furthermore, these models lack the capacity to handle high resolution images due to memory constraints. To address these issues we propose recurrent attentional networks that incorporate 3D spatio-temporal attention mechanisms. Our model uses an end-to-end approach where the network learns to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities jointly. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets and show state-of-the-art performance while achieving efficient inference speed. Our results indicate that 3D attentional networks are effective at handling large scale object detection tasks by capturing both short range appearance features as well as more global contextual relationships between objects.",1
"Learning interpretable and transferable subpolicies and performing task decomposition from a single, complex task is difficult. Some traditional hierarchical reinforcement learning techniques enforce this decomposition in a top-down manner, while meta-learning techniques require a task distribution at hand to learn such decompositions. This paper presents a framework for using diverse suboptimal world models to decompose complex task solutions into simpler modular subpolicies. This framework performs automatic decomposition of a single source task in a bottom up manner, concurrently learning the required modular subpolicies as well as a controller to coordinate them. We perform a series of experiments on high dimensional continuous action control tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach at both complex single task learning and lifelong learning. Finally, we perform ablation studies to understand the importance and robustness of different elements in the framework and limitations to this approach.",0
"Incorporate keywords such as reinforcement learning (RL), hierarchical task decomposition, lifelong learning, model-based RL, meta-learning, neuroevolution, and neural architecture search(NAS). Be concise while providing enough detail for someone unfamiliar with the field to understand the purpose and significance of the proposed method. Consider including examples of real-world applications where applicable. The goal of this work is to develop a new approach to reinforcement learning (RL) that can tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler subtasks and solving these one at a time through hierarchical problem decomposition. This method aims to enable agents to learn multiple skills throughout their lifetime, allowing them to solve both existing and previously unseen problems. We propose using a meta-learning framework based on model-predictive control and model-free value iteration. By leveraging neural architecture search, we aim to find better models for each task and make use of previously learned knowledge when addressing novel situations. To validate our approach, we demonstrate promising results across several challenging benchmarks, including continuous control domains, text-based environments, and classic Atari games. Our work has potential application in robotics, automation, natural language processing, and other areas where intelligent behavior is required. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of lifelong learning methods for artificial intelligence, enabling agents to adapt and evolve over time like humans do.",1
"This paper investigates whether learning contingency-awareness and controllable aspects of an environment can lead to better exploration in reinforcement learning. To investigate this question, we consider an instantiation of this hypothesis evaluated on the Arcade Learning Element (ALE). In this study, we develop an attentive dynamics model (ADM) that discovers controllable elements of the observations, which are often associated with the location of the character in Atari games. The ADM is trained in a self-supervised fashion to predict the actions taken by the agent. The learned contingency information is used as a part of the state representation for exploration purposes. We demonstrate that combining actor-critic algorithm with count-based exploration using our representation achieves impressive results on a set of notoriously challenging Atari games due to sparse rewards. For example, we report a state-of-the-art score of 11,000 points on Montezuma's Revenge without using expert demonstrations, explicit high-level information (e.g., RAM states), or supervisory data. Our experiments confirm that contingency-awareness is indeed an extremely powerful concept for tackling exploration problems in reinforcement learning and opens up interesting research questions for further investigations.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), agents learn policies through trial and error by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards based on their actions. However, exploring uncertain environments can lead to suboptimal solutions due to lack of knowledge about possible outcomes. This article proposes contingency-aware exploration as a means of improving RL performance under uncertainty. We show that incorporating contingencies into the agent’s objective allows it to balance exploitation and exploration more effectively. Our approach considers both known and unknown uncertainties, enabling efficient adaptation to changing environments without overly conservative behavior. Empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvements across multiple domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in dealing with real-world complexities. Overall, we present a novel approach to address exploration challenges in RL, promoting more robust and adaptive behavior in dynamic settings.",1
"Efficiently adapting to new environments and changes in dynamics is critical for agents to successfully operate in the real world. Reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches typically rely on external reward feedback for adaptation. However, in many scenarios this reward signal might not be readily available for the target task, or the difference between the environments can be implicit and only observable from the dynamics. To this end, we introduce a method that allows for self-adaptation of learned policies: No-Reward Meta Learning (NoRML). NoRML extends Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) for RL and uses observable dynamics of the environment instead of an explicit reward function in MAML's finetune step. Our method has a more expressive update step than MAML, while maintaining MAML's gradient based foundation. Additionally, in order to allow more targeted exploration, we implement an extension to MAML that effectively disconnects the meta-policy parameters from the fine-tuned policies' parameters. We first study our method on a number of synthetic control problems and then validate our method on common benchmark environments, showing that NoRML outperforms MAML when the dynamics change between tasks.",0
"Normal human learning uses rewards (both positive and negative) as one of its main feedback mechanisms; it helps us learn by associating certain behaviors with good outcomes. By contrast, NorML (no-reward meta learning) leverages existing reward systems to provide new, synthetic reward signals that allow agents to adapt to changing environments without requiring explicit retraining. This innovative approach enables more efficient exploration of state space and makes it possible to apply deep RL methods where traditional methods have failed. Ultimately, NorML paves the way towards achieving general intelligence through enhanced intrinsic motivation.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning, applied to vision-based problems like Atari games, maps pixels directly to actions; internally, the deep neural network bears the responsibility of both extracting useful information and making decisions based on it. By separating the image processing from decision-making, one could better understand the complexity of each task, as well as potentially find smaller policy representations that are easier for humans to understand and may generalize better. To this end, we propose a new method for learning policies and compact state representations separately but simultaneously for policy approximation in reinforcement learning. State representations are generated by an encoder based on two novel algorithms: Increasing Dictionary Vector Quantization makes the encoder capable of growing its dictionary size over time, to address new observations as they appear in an open-ended online-learning context; Direct Residuals Sparse Coding encodes observations by disregarding reconstruction error minimization, and aiming instead for highest information inclusion. The encoder autonomously selects observations online to train on, in order to maximize code sparsity. As the dictionary size increases, the encoder produces increasingly larger inputs for the neural network: this is addressed by a variation of the Exponential Natural Evolution Strategies algorithm which adapts its probability distribution dimensionality along the run. We test our system on a selection of Atari games using tiny neural networks of only 6 to 18 neurons (depending on the game's controls). These are still capable of achieving results comparable---and occasionally superior---to state-of-the-art techniques which use two orders of magnitude more neurons.",0
"This paper investigates whether artificial neural networks can learn complex tasks using only six neurons, a fraction of traditional models that contain millions or even billions of them. Through extensive experimentation on multiple classic video games from the Atari 2600 library, we demonstrate that simple but carefully crafted architectures with few parameters can indeed perform surprisingly well compared to their larger counterparts. We then analyze these results through several lenses: architecture design principles behind our successful agents, human expert gameplay comparisons across different games, evaluation metrics other than score, and analysis of network activity during training and inference. Collectively, these studies challenge conventional wisdom regarding both the scale and complexity of neural network models required to tackle realworld problems and provide insight into how these compact systems achieve success despite their limitations. Finally, we explore promising research directions aimed at further developing the potential of smallneural networks in complex problem domains.",1
"Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) has been proved to be a successful reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for continuous control tasks. However, DDPG still suffers from data insufficiency and training inefficiency, especially in computationally complex environments. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Episodic DDPG (AE-DDPG), as an expansion of DDPG, which can achieve more effective learning with less training time required. First, we design a modified scheme for data collection in an asynchronous fashion. Generally, for asynchronous RL algorithms, sample efficiency or/and training stability diminish as the degree of parallelism increases. We consider this problem from the perspectives of both data generation and data utilization. In detail, we re-design experience replay by introducing the idea of episodic control so that the agent can latch on good trajectories rapidly. In addition, we also inject a new type of noise in action space to enrich the exploration behaviors. Experiments demonstrate that our AE-DDPG achieves higher rewards and requires less time consuming than most popular RL algorithms in Learning to Run task which has a computationally complex environment. Not limited to the control tasks in computationally complex environments, AE-DDPG also achieves higher rewards and 2- to 4-fold improvement in sample efficiency on average compared to other variants of DDPG in MuJoCo environments. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of each proposed technique component through abundant ablation study.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to continuous control in computationally complex environments using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms combined with asynchronous episode training and experience replay. In order to handle these challenging environments, the authors propose several modifications to the traditional DDPG algorithm, including changes to the update schedule and memory management system. They demonstrate through extensive simulations that their method outperforms existing methods by significantly improving both sample efficiency and overall performance. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into how we can develop more efficient and effective reinforcement learning algorithms for use in real-world applications.",1
"In this empirical paper, we investigate how learning agents can be arranged in more efficient communication topologies for improved learning. This is an important problem because a common technique to improve speed and robustness of learning in deep reinforcement learning and many other machine learning algorithms is to run multiple learning agents in parallel. The standard communication architecture typically involves all agents intermittently communicating with each other (fully connected topology) or with a centralized server (star topology). Unfortunately, optimizing the topology of communication over the space of all possible graphs is a hard problem, so we borrow results from the networked optimization and collective intelligence literatures which suggest that certain families of network topologies can lead to strong improvements over fully-connected networks. We start by introducing alternative network topologies to DRL benchmark tasks under the Evolution Strategies paradigm which we call Network Evolution Strategies. We explore the relative performance of the four main graph families and observe that one such family (Erdos-Renyi random graphs) empirically outperforms all other families, including the de facto fully-connected communication topologies. Additionally, the use of alternative network topologies has a multiplicative performance effect: we observe that when 1000 learning agents are arranged in a carefully designed communication topology, they can compete with 3000 agents arranged in the de facto fully-connected topology. Overall, our work suggests that distributed machine learning algorithms would learn more efficiently if the communication topology between learning agents was optimized.",0
"In today’s fast-paced world, finding ways to make our lives more efficient is becoming increasingly important. One area that has been seeing significant advancements recently is deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, which are computer systems designed to learn from trial and error without being explicitly programmed.

As a result, understanding how to organize these agents within specific communication topologies is crucial for maximizing efficiency and success. This paper explores the importance of communication topology in deep RL agent design and offers practical insights into optimal organization methods based on real-world experiments. By highlighting effective techniques, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners alike with valuable guidance for developing cutting-edge, high-performance RL agents in diverse application domains.",1
"Building a good predictive model requires an array of activities such as data imputation, feature transformations, estimator selection, hyper-parameter search and ensemble construction. Given the large, complex and heterogenous space of options, off-the-shelf optimization methods are infeasible for realistic response times. In practice, much of the predictive modeling process is conducted by experienced data scientists, who selectively make use of available tools. Over time, they develop an understanding of the behavior of operators, and perform serial decision making under uncertainty, colloquially referred to as educated guesswork. With an unprecedented demand for application of supervised machine learning, there is a call for solutions that automatically search for a good combination of parameters across these tasks to minimize the modeling error. We introduce a novel system called APRL (Autonomous Predictive modeler via Reinforcement Learning), that uses past experience through reinforcement learning to optimize such sequential decision making from within a set of diverse actions under a time constraint on a previously unseen predictive learning problem. APRL actions are taken to optimize the performance of a final ensemble. This is in contrast to other systems, which maximize individual model accuracy first and create ensembles as a disconnected post-processing step. As a result, APRL is able to reduce up to 71\% of classification error on average over a wide variety of problems.",0
"One approach for automating predictive modeling processes has been through the use of reinforcement learning (RL).

We evaluate our methodology by considering several real world datasets where traditional machine learning techniques have failed to produce desired outcomes. Our results show that the proposed framework consistently provides better performing models than those generated by standard methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that these gains can also be achieved at a faster rate, highlighting the potential benefits of deploying such systems across industry. Overall, our work emphasizes the importance of incorporating automatic predictive modelling within data driven decision making, paving the way for more intelligent systems capable of handling complex tasks without direct supervision.",1
"Pedestrian detection is one of the most explored topics in computer vision and robotics. The use of deep learning methods allowed the development of new and highly competitive algorithms. Deep Reinforcement Learning has proved to be within the state-of-the-art in terms of both detection in perspective cameras and robotics applications. However, for detection in omnidirectional cameras, the literature is still scarce, mostly because of their high levels of distortion. This paper presents a novel and efficient technique for robust pedestrian detection in omnidirectional images. The proposed method uses deep Reinforcement Learning that takes advantage of the distortion in the image. By considering the 3D bounding boxes and their distorted projections into the image, our method is able to provide the pedestrian's position in the world, in contrast to the image positions provided by most state-of-the-art methods for perspective cameras. Our method avoids the need of pre-processing steps to remove the distortion, which is computationally expensive. Beyond the novel solution, our method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methodologies that do not consider the underlying distortion for the detection task.",0

Our experimental results show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on publicly available datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of our model across different scenarios and vehicle mounting positions. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we make our code and models freely available online. Overall, our work highlights the potential of deep RL for robust pedestrian detection on omnidirectional cameras, paving the way for safer autonomous driving systems.",1
"Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) consists in the use of ultrasound imaging in critical or emergency situations to support clinical decisions by healthcare professionals and first responders. In this setting it is essential to be able to provide means to obtain diagnostic data to potentially inexperienced users who did not receive an extensive medical training. Interpretation and acquisition of ultrasound images is not trivial. First, the user needs to find a suitable sound window which can be used to get a clear image, and then he needs to correctly interpret it to perform a diagnosis. Although many recent approaches focus on developing smart ultrasound devices that add interpretation capabilities to existing systems, our goal in this paper is to present a reinforcement learning (RL) strategy which is capable to guide novice users to the correct sonic window and enable them to obtain clinically relevant pictures of the anatomy of interest. We apply our approach to cardiac images acquired from the parasternal long axis (PLAx) view of the left ventricle of the heart.",0
"Ultrasound technology has transformed the medical field by providing noninvasive imaging techniques that enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

"Humans are capable of attributing latent mental contents such as beliefs or intentions to others. The social skill is critical in daily life for reasoning about the potential consequences of others' behaviors so as to plan ahead. It is known that humans use such reasoning ability recursively by considering what others believe about their own beliefs. In this paper, we start from level-$1$ recursion and introduce a probabilistic recursive reasoning (PR2) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our hypothesis is that it is beneficial for each agent to account for how the opponents would react to its future behaviors. Under the PR2 framework, we adopt variational Bayes methods to approximate the opponents' conditional policies, to which each agent finds the best response and then improve their own policies. We develop decentralized-training-decentralized-execution algorithms, namely PR2-Q and PR2-Actor-Critic, that are proved to converge in the self-play scenarios when there exists one Nash equilibrium. Our methods are tested on both the matrix game and the differential game, which have a non-trivial equilibrium where common gradient-based methods fail to converge. Our experiments show that it is critical to reason about how the opponents believe about what the agent believes. We expect our work to contribute a new idea of modeling the opponents to the multi-agent reinforcement learning community.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), one particularly challenging problem facing researchers today is how to enable agents in multi-agent environments to make effective decisions that take into account uncertainty and interact with other agents. One potential solution to this problem is probabilistic recursive reasoning, which involves applying Bayesian inference techniques to update beliefs recursively over time based on new evidence. This approach has been shown to yield promising results in single-agent decision making tasks, but its application to multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored.  This paper presents a novel algorithm called Probabilistic Recursive Reasoning for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PRR-MARL) that incorporates probabilistic recursive reasoning into MARL frameworks. PRR-MARL enables each agent to maintain an individual probability distribution over possible states of the world and use these distributions to model uncertain events and plan actions accordingly. Our proposed method allows agents to share their beliefs through communication, leading to more efficient collaboration among team members. Furthermore, we show how our algorithm can learn policies that balance exploration against exploitation, while taking into consideration the impact of uncertainty and the presence of other agents. We evaluate PRR-MARL using several benchmark multi-agent domains and demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of metrics.  In summary, we believe that PRR-MARL represents a significant step forward in enabling multi-agent systems to effectively reason under uncertainty and coordinate with others in complex and dynamic environments.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) typically defines a discount factor as part of the Markov Decision Process. The discount factor values future rewards by an exponential scheme that leads to theoretical convergence guarantees of the Bellman equation. However, evidence from psychology, economics and neuroscience suggests that humans and animals instead have hyperbolic time-preferences. In this work we revisit the fundamentals of discounting in RL and bridge this disconnect by implementing an RL agent that acts via hyperbolic discounting. We demonstrate that a simple approach approximates hyperbolic discount functions while still using familiar temporal-difference learning techniques in RL. Additionally, and independent of hyperbolic discounting, we make a surprising discovery that simultaneously learning value functions over multiple time-horizons is an effective auxiliary task which often improves over a strong value-based RL agent, Rainbow.",0
"This study explores how individuals make economic decisions across multiple time horizons and how hyperbolic discounting affects these choices. We present a model that incorporates both exponential and nonlinear components of temporal preference, allowing us to examine how these components interact in decision making processes spanning several periods. Our results suggest that both the near term implications of current choices as well as more distant consequences are important factors driving intertemporal behavior. Additionally, we find evidence suggesting that some individuals have an enhanced capacity to learn from experience over longer periods of time, which can lead to improved decision making outcomes. Finally, our analysis contributes to ongoing discussions regarding the nature and measurement of individual time preferences by demonstrating how different measures may better capture specific aspects of temporal choice patterns within and across time frames. Overall, the insights provided by our research provide new perspectives on how humans balance immediate gratification against future rewards, informing theories of rationality, self-control, and sustainability across various domains including finance, healthcare, and environmental management.",1
"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are currently being used as function approximators in many state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been shown to drastically reduce the energy consumption of ANNs by encoding information in sparse temporal binary spike streams, hence emulating the communication mechanism of biological neurons. Due to their low energy consumption, SNNs are considered to be important candidates as co-processors to be implemented in mobile devices. In this work, the use of SNNs as stochastic policies is explored under an energy-efficient first-to-spike action rule, whereby the action taken by the RL agent is determined by the occurrence of the first spike among the output neurons. A policy gradient-based algorithm is derived considering a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for spiking neurons. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of online trained SNNs as stochastic policies to gracefully trade energy consumption, as measured by the number of spikes, and control performance. Significant gains are shown as compared to the standard approach of converting an offline trained ANN into an SNN.",0

To address this problem, we propose a novel method based on policy gradients that learns ""first-to-spike"" policies for spiking neural networks (SNNs) used for real-time decision making in neuromorphic devices. Our approach relies on a model-free reinforcement learning framework using temporal difference learning and Monte Carlo sampling to estimate action values, which are then combined with SNN dynamics and reward signals to update the policy iteratively. We evaluate our method through numerical simulations and experiments on custom neuromorphic hardware, demonstrating improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and stability. Overall, our work provides new insights into efficient control strategies for SNNs in neuromorphic systems, paving the way for next-generation intelligent devices capable of processing complex tasks at low power consumption.",1
"Traditional reinforcement learning agents learn from experience, past or present, gained through interaction with their environment. Our approach synthesizes experience, without requiring an agent to interact with their environment, by asking the policy directly ""Are there situations X, Y, and Z, such that in these situations you would select actions A, B, and C?"" In this paper we present Introspection Learning, an algorithm that allows for the asking of these types of questions of neural network policies. Introspection Learning is reinforcement learning algorithm agnostic and the states returned may be used as an indicator of the health of the policy or to shape the policy in a myriad of ways. We demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm both in the context of speeding up training and improving robustness with respect to safety constraints.",0

They present evidence from psychology research demonstrating the benefits of introspection on mental health, creativity, problem solving, and relationships. Additionally, they discuss techniques for enhancing introspective abilities, such as mindfulness meditation and journaling. Finally, the authors consider potential applications of introspection learning in areas such as education, therapy, and leadership training.

"Although reinforcement learning methods can achieve impressive results in simulation, the real world presents two major challenges: generating samples is exceedingly expensive, and unexpected perturbations or unseen situations cause proficient but specialized policies to fail at test time. Given that it is impractical to train separate policies to accommodate all situations the agent may see in the real world, this work proposes to learn how to quickly and effectively adapt online to new tasks. To enable sample-efficient learning, we consider learning online adaptation in the context of model-based reinforcement learning. Our approach uses meta-learning to train a dynamics model prior such that, when combined with recent data, this prior can be rapidly adapted to the local context. Our experiments demonstrate online adaptation for continuous control tasks on both simulated and real-world agents. We first show simulated agents adapting their behavior online to novel terrains, crippled body parts, and highly-dynamic environments. We also illustrate the importance of incorporating online adaptation into autonomous agents that operate in the real world by applying our method to a real dynamic legged millirobot. We demonstrate the agent's learned ability to quickly adapt online to a missing leg, adjust to novel terrains and slopes, account for miscalibration or errors in pose estimation, and compensate for pulling payloads.",0
"In this research, we focus on adapting to dynamic environments by proposing meta-reinforcement learning as a method to enable agents to learn policies that can effectively perform tasks across varying conditions. This approach allows an agent to rapidly switch from one learned policy to another while minimizing the impact of negative adaptation performance. We present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach, including scenarios where static policies fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings show that meta-RL approaches improve adaptation speed and accuracy compared to alternative methods such as fine-tuning or retraining. We also discuss future directions to further develop and refine our proposed method. Overall, this work contributes valuable insights into enabling adaptive behavior in real-world situations.",1
"In this paper, the distributed edge caching problem in fog radio access networks (F-RANs) is investigated. By considering the unknown spatio-temporal content popularity and user preference, a user request model based on hidden Markov process is proposed to characterize the fluctuant spatio-temporal traffic demands in F-RANs. Then, the Q-learning method based on the reinforcement learning (RL) framework is put forth to seek the optimal caching policy in a distributed manner, which enables fog access points (F-APs) to learn and track the potential dynamic process without extra communications cost. Furthermore, we propose a more efficient Q-learning method with value function approximation (Q-VFA-learning) to reduce complexity and accelerate convergence. Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to those of the traditional methods.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distributed edge caching in fog radio access networks (FANETs) using reinforcement learning (RL). With the increasing demand for high data rates and low latency services, efficient content delivery becomes crucial. Traditional centralized approaches face challenges such as network congestion and high transmission costs, which can lead to poor quality of experience (QoE) for end users. Our proposed method addresses these issues by leveraging RL techniques to enable distributed caching at the edge of the network. We formulate the caching problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), where each fog node makes decisions based on local state observations and rewards received from successful content deliveries. Our algorithm adapts over time through trial-and-error learning, allowing fog nodes to select optimal cache placement strategies that maximize content hit ratios while minimizing communication overhead. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in QoE metrics compared to conventional schemes, including reduced delay and increased success rate for content requests. This work paves the way for enhancing FANET performance through intelligent caching mechanisms powered by advanced RL algorithms.",1
"We consider reinforcement learning in input-driven environments, where an exogenous, stochastic input process affects the dynamics of the system. Input processes arise in many applications, including queuing systems, robotics control with disturbances, and object tracking. Since the state dynamics and rewards depend on the input process, the state alone provides limited information for the expected future returns. Therefore, policy gradient methods with standard state-dependent baselines suffer high variance during training. We derive a bias-free, input-dependent baseline to reduce this variance, and analytically show its benefits over state-dependent baselines. We then propose a meta-learning approach to overcome the complexity of learning a baseline that depends on a long sequence of inputs. Our experimental results show that across environments from queuing systems, computer networks, and MuJoCo robotic locomotion, input-dependent baselines consistently improve training stability and result in better eventual policies.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence, one of the key challenges faced by reinforcement learning (RL) agents operating in input-driven environments is variance reduction. This refers to reducing the uncertainty that arises from the randomness inherent in these types of environments. Various techniques have been proposed to address this issue; however, most existing approaches suffer from either high computational complexity or limited effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called ""Variance Reduction for RL in Input-Driven Environments"" that addresses these shortcomings. Our approach combines online variance estimation with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms in order to reduce variance effectively without incurring excessive computational cost. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through empirical evaluations on benchmark tasks such as OpenAI Gym, showing improved sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to other existing methods.",1
"Q-learning methods represent a commonly used class of algorithms in reinforcement learning: they are generally efficient and simple, and can be combined readily with function approximators for deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, the behavior of Q-learning methods with function approximation is poorly understood, both theoretically and empirically. In this work, we aim to experimentally investigate potential issues in Q-learning, by means of a ""unit testing"" framework where we can utilize oracles to disentangle sources of error. Specifically, we investigate questions related to function approximation, sampling error and nonstationarity, and where available, verify if trends found in oracle settings hold true with modern deep RL methods. We find that large neural network architectures have many benefits with regards to learning stability; offer several practical compensations for overfitting; and develop a novel sampling method based on explicitly compensating for function approximation error that yields fair improvement on high-dimensional continuous control domains.",0
"In deep reinforcement learning (RL), algorithms face several challenges while training deep neural networks that must make decisions based on large amounts of data. One crucial aspect of these challenges is identifying bottlenecks during training. In ""Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Deep Q-Learning Algorithms,"" we aim to tackle this problem by presenting three approaches to diagnose bottlenecks in deep Q-learning methods: gradient norm analysis, layerwise Taylor decomposition, and importance scoring. These techniques enable us to quantify how each component of the loss function contributes to the overall performance of the algorithm. Our results show that our methodology can effectively identify the root causes of poor convergence speed, allowing researchers to optimize their models more efficiently. By providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of deep RL, our work opens up new possibilities for advancing the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence.",1
"Autonomous driving is a challenging domain that entails multiple aspects: a vehicle should be able to drive to its destination as fast as possible while avoiding collision, obeying traffic rules and ensuring the comfort of passengers. In this paper, we present a deep learning variant of thresholded lexicographic Q-learning for the task of urban driving. Our multi-objective DQN agent learns to drive on multi-lane roads and intersections, yielding and changing lanes according to traffic rules. We also propose an extension for factored Markov Decision Processes to the DQN architecture that provides auxiliary features for the Q function. This is shown to significantly improve data efficiency. We then show that the learned policy is able to zero-shot transfer to a ring road without sacrificing performance.",0
"This abstract is for a research paper that presents a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning approach for urban driving systems. In recent years, self-driving cars have become increasingly important due to their potential to improve road safety and reduce traffic congestion. However, developing autonomous vehicles that can navigate complex urban environments remains a challenge. Existing approaches typically focus on optimizing either comfort or efficiency objectives while neglecting other critical factors such as speed, safety, fuel consumption, and passenger experience. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning techniques to learn optimal policies that balance multiple objectives simultaneously. Our model uses a real-time prediction module based on Gaussian processes to generate trajectories considering both current and future states. We validate our approach using a state-of-the-art simulation platform that integrates high-fidelity sensors and actuators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance compared to single objective baselines across all evaluation metrics including driving safety, efficiency, ride comfort, and passenger satisfaction. Furthermore, we showcase the generalization capabilities of our system by evaluating it in different weather conditions and unseen scenarios. Overall, our work advances the understanding of urban driving challenges and offers promising solutions towards safer, more efficient, and personalized autonomous transportation systems. The proposed approach has far-reaching implications for industries such as automotive, robotics, and intelligent transportation.",1
"High-level driving behavior decision-making is an open-challenging problem for connected vehicle technology, especially in heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning based high-level driving behavior decision-making approach is proposed for connected vehicle in heterogeneous traffic situations. The model is composed of three main parts: a data preprocessor that maps hybrid data into a data format called hyper-grid matrix, a two-stream deep neural network that extracts the hidden features, and a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal policy. Moreover, a simulation environment, which includes different heterogeneous traffic scenarios, is built to train and test the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the model has the capability to learn the optimal high-level driving policy such as driving fast through heterogeneous traffic without unnecessary lane changes. Furthermore, two separate models are used to compare with the proposed model, and the performances are analyzed in detail.",0
"In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for developing high-level driving behavior decision-making models in heterogeneous traffic environments. The proposed model utilizes a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract relevant features from raw sensor data such as camera images, LIDAR point clouds, and vehicle telemetry. We then formulate a Markov decision process that allows our agent to make decisions based on these extracted features while considering uncertainty, risk, and safety constraints. Our training algorithm uses both imitation learning and reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the decision-making policy. Finally, we evaluate our model through extensive simulation experiments under different traffic scenarios and show promising results in terms of performance, robustness, and adaptability compared to other approaches in literature. Overall, our work advances the development of intelligent autonomous systems by addressing some of the challenges associated with decision making in complex urban environments with mixed human-agent interactions.",1
"Actor-critic methods can achieve incredible performance on difficult reinforcement learning problems, but they are also prone to instability. This is partly due to the interaction between the actor and critic during learning, e.g., an inaccurate step taken by one of them might adversely affect the other and destabilize the learning. To avoid such issues, we propose to regularize the learning objective of the actor by penalizing the temporal difference (TD) error of the critic. This improves stability by avoiding large steps in the actor update whenever the critic is highly inaccurate. The resulting method, which we call the TD-regularized actor-critic method, is a simple plug-and-play approach to improve stability and overall performance of the actor-critic methods. Evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm this.",0
"Machine learning has recently seen significant advances in the field of deep reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms learn to make decisions by trial and error through interacting with an environment. One popular approach to RL is the actor-critic method, which separates the action selection policy from value estimation. However, these methods can suffer from high variance due to the stochastic nature of the environments they operate in. To address this issue, we propose using temporal difference regularization within the framework of actor-critic RL, resulting in TD-regularized actor-critic methods. Our approach adds a regulator network that learns to predict future states based on past observations, allowing us to constrain overestimation of expected returns. We showcase state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark tasks while demonstrating robustness against hyperparameter settings compared to existing methods. In addition, we provide analytical insights into the behavior of our algorithm and discuss potential applications beyond traditional RL domains. This work represents a step forward towards reliable and efficient decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Real-time traffic volume inference is key to an intelligent city. It is a challenging task because accurate traffic volumes on the roads can only be measured at certain locations where sensors are installed. Moreover, the traffic evolves over time due to the influences of weather, events, holidays, etc. Existing solutions to the traffic volume inference problem often rely on dense GPS trajectories, which inevitably fail to account for the vehicles which carry no GPS devices or have them turned off. Consequently, the results are biased to taxicabs because they are almost always online for GPS tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the citywide traffic volume inference using both dense GPS trajectories and incomplete trajectories captured by camera surveillance systems. Our approach employs a high-fidelity traffic simulator and deep reinforcement learning to recover full vehicle movements from the incomplete trajectories. In order to jointly model the recovered trajectories and dense GPS trajectories, we construct spatiotemporal graphs and use multi-view graph embedding to encode the multi-hop correlations between road segments into real-valued vectors. Finally, we infer the citywide traffic volumes by propagating the traffic values of monitored road segments to the unmonitored ones through masked pairwise similarities. Extensive experiments with two big regions in a provincial capital city in China verify the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"This can be achieved by exploiting both dense trajectory data as well as other sources such as transportation statistics. I would suggest including some kind of description of how joint modeling works in the context of traffic volume inference, e.g.:",1
"Generating novel graph structures that optimize given objectives while obeying some given underlying rules is fundamental for chemistry, biology and social science research. This is especially important in the task of molecular graph generation, whose goal is to discover novel molecules with desired properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, while obeying physical laws such as chemical valency. However, designing models to find molecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex and non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional network based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement learning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that incorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can achieve 61% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art baselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184% improvement on the constrained property optimization task.",0
"Molecular graph generation (MGG) can be used to predict molecules that match specific properties and descriptors. In current methods for MGG such as RDKit and DeepRDkit, atom pairs and atomic orbital overlap matrices are traditionally utilized in order to model chemical bonding interactions in the generated graphs. Recent advances have shown success using graph convolutions on molecule graphs for property prediction tasks. We present a novel approach which incorporates these graph convolutions into policy networks trained through reinforcement learning (RL), termed the Graph Convolutional Policy Network. Our method samples subgraphs from random starting points by repeatedly applying local perturbations designed to improve predicted objective function values rather than simply generating molecules randomly and iteratively modifying them as done in prior work. Objective functions used to train our network were inspired by drug discovery applications and included metrics related to synthetic accessibility, medicinal chemistry space coverage, and potential favorability based on biological activity in various therapeutic areas. Using this unique combination of techniques, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on datasets involving both small organic molecules and larger peptides relative to existing benchmark models across multiple diverse evaluation metrics including logarithmic scores for binding affinity predictions. Our results suggest that RL coupled with graph convolutions may represent a powerful paradigm shift towards improving automated molecular design efforts beyond simple search algorithms and rule-based systems towards more holistically informed strategies. Ultimately, given our strong experimental findings in this preliminary investigation, future work will involve expanding these methodologies to real-world drug discovery challenges in collaboration with industry partners.

"Learning how to act when there are many available actions in each state is a challenging task for Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, especially when many of the actions are redundant or irrelevant. In such cases, it is sometimes easier to learn which actions not to take. In this work, we propose the Action-Elimination Deep Q-Network (AE-DQN) architecture that combines a Deep RL algorithm with an Action Elimination Network (AEN) that eliminates sub-optimal actions. The AEN is trained to predict invalid actions, supervised by an external elimination signal provided by the environment. Simulations demonstrate a considerable speedup and added robustness over vanilla DQN in text-based games with over a thousand discrete actions.",0
"Title: How Reward Shaping Can Improve Deep Reinforcement Learning Performance on Complex Tasks  Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant progress in solving complex problems, but current methods still struggle with tasks that require efficient exploration strategies. In many real-world scenarios, finding an optimal solution is impractical due to time constraints or computational limitations. Therefore, RL algorithms should focus on efficiently eliminating unpromising actions rather than exhaustively searching through all possible solutions. One approach to address this challenge is reward shaping, which modifies the original reward function by adding a shaping reward that guides the agent towards desirable behaviors. This study investigates how reward shaping can improve deep reinforcement learning performance on complex tasks.  To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we tested several state-of-the-art RL algorithms combined with different shaping techniques on a set of challenging benchmark environments. We found that incorporating a well-designed shaping signal into the training process significantly accelerates the learning speed and leads to higher final performances compared to baseline models without shaping. Furthermore, we observed that carefully constructed shaping rewards can effectively steer the agent toward better action selection policies, allowing it to discard suboptimal options earlier and converge faster to near-optimal solutions.  These results demonstrate the potential benefits of using reward shaping as a tool to guide RL agents towards promising regions of the search space. Our work provides insights into designing effective shaping signals and outlines future research directions towards more automated procedures for generating such signals from expert demonstrations or human feedback. Overall, our findings contribute to improving the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for solving complex real-world problems.",1
"Deep hashing methods have received much attention recently, which achieve promising results by taking advantage of the strong representation power of deep networks. However, most existing deep hashing methods learn a whole set of hashing functions independently, while ignore the correlations between different hashing functions that can promote the retrieval accuracy greatly. Inspired by the sequential decision ability of deep reinforcement learning, we propose a new Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for Image Hashing (DRLIH). Our proposed DRLIH approach models the hashing learning problem as a sequential decision process, which learns each hashing function by correcting the errors imposed by previous ones and promotes retrieval accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address hashing problem from deep reinforcement learning perspective. The main contributions of our proposed DRLIH approach can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a deep reinforcement learning hashing network. In the proposed network, we utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) as agents to model the hashing functions, which take actions of projecting images into binary codes sequentially, so that the current hashing function learning can take previous hashing functions' error into account. (2) We propose a sequential learning strategy based on proposed DRLIH. We define the state as a tuple of internal features of RNN's hidden layers and image features, which can reflect history decisions made by the agents. We also propose an action group method to enhance the correlation of hash functions in the same group. Experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DRLIH approach.",0
"""Image hashing has received significant attention in recent years as a technique used to efficiently store, retrieve, and organize large collections of images.

In this paper, we propose using deep reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize image hashing models and improve their performance. Our approach involves designing a reward function based on retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency, and then using a policy gradient method to update the model parameters iteratively towards better solutions. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods.""",1
"The success of popular algorithms for deep reinforcement learning, such as policy-gradients and Q-learning, relies heavily on the availability of an informative reward signal at each timestep of the sequential decision-making process. When rewards are only sparsely available during an episode, or a rewarding feedback is provided only after episode termination, these algorithms perform sub-optimally due to the difficultly in credit assignment. Alternatively, trajectory-based policy optimization methods, such as cross-entropy method and evolution strategies, do not require per-timestep rewards, but have been found to suffer from high sample complexity by completing forgoing the temporal nature of the problem. Improving the efficiency of RL algorithms in real-world problems with sparse or episodic rewards is therefore a pressing need. In this work, we introduce a self-imitation learning algorithm that exploits and explores well in the sparse and episodic reward settings. We view each policy as a state-action visitation distribution and formulate policy optimization as a divergence minimization problem. We show that with Jensen-Shannon divergence, this divergence minimization problem can be reduced into a policy-gradient algorithm with shaped rewards learned from experience replays. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm works comparable to existing algorithms in environments with dense rewards, and significantly better in environments with sparse and episodic rewards. We then discuss limitations of self-imitation learning, and propose to solve them by using Stein variational policy gradient descent with the Jensen-Shannon kernel to learn multiple diverse policies. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a challenging variant of continuous-control MuJoCo locomotion tasks.",0
"This is a challenging task, but here’s my attempt:  Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in recent years, but developing algorithms that can learn, adapt, and generalize to new situations remains a formidable challenge. One promising approach is through reinforcement learning, where agents learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. However, traditional reinforcement learning methods often suffer from a number of limitations, including brittleness and poor transferability across different tasks.  In order to address these issues, researchers have explored alternative approaches such as imitation learning, which involves training agents using demonstrations provided by human experts. While effective, imitation learning suffers from several drawbacks, including lack of diversity and scalability, as well as difficulty in handling high-dimensional state spaces.  This paper presents a novel algorithm for learning self-imitating diverse policies (SIDP), which combines elements of both reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Our method learns multiple policies simultaneously, allowing them to specialize on different subtasks while sharing knowledge via expert guidance. By doing so, our algorithm is able to generate more diverse solutions compared to previous methods, resulting in better performance on complex tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SIDP through extensive experiments on several benchmark environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards building agents capable of learning and adapting to ever-changing real-world scenarios.",1
"We consider a problem of learning the reward and policy from expert examples under unknown dynamics. Our proposed method builds on the framework of generative adversarial networks and introduces the empowerment-regularized maximum-entropy inverse reinforcement learning to learn near-optimal rewards and policies. Empowerment-based regularization prevents the policy from overfitting to expert demonstrations, which advantageously leads to more generalized behaviors that result in learning near-optimal rewards. Our method simultaneously learns empowerment through variational information maximization along with the reward and policy under the adversarial learning formulation. We evaluate our approach on various high-dimensional complex control tasks. We also test our learned rewards in challenging transfer learning problems where training and testing environments are made to be different from each other in terms of dynamics or structure. The results show that our proposed method not only learns near-optimal rewards and policies that are matching expert behavior but also performs significantly better than state-of-the-art inverse reinforcement learning algorithms.",0
"Title: Adversarial Imitation via Variational Inverse Reinforcement Learning Author: Xavier Bouthillier Abstract This paper presents a novel approach for adversarial imitation learning that combines variational inverse reinforcement learning (VIRL) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We propose to use VIRL to learn a latent representation of the task objective from expert demonstrations, which can then be used as guidance for a GAN to generate synthetic trajectories that mimic the behavior of the expert. By minimizing the reconstruction error between real and generated trajectories using a discriminator network, we enforce that the learned policy behaves similarly to the expert. Our method outperforms prior work on several challenging tasks, including cartpole swingup, MountainCar, and Pendulum-v2. Additionally, our results show that the combination of VIRL and GANs leads to more efficient exploration than previously proposed methods, highlighting the potential benefits of using intrinsic motivation in conjunction with imitation learning.

"Abstract: This research explores the use of Recurrent Capsule Networks (RCN) for state representation learning. RCNs are a type of neural network architecture that utilize capsules, which are groups of neurons that work together to encode complex features such as objects and relationships.

Our experiments demonstrate promising results on several benchmark datasets across multiple domains, suggesting that RCNs can effectively learn high-quality representations of both static and dynamic data sources. These findings have important implications for the fields of machine learning and computer vision, where state representation has proven to be a crucial task in many applications such as object tracking, action recognition, and video classification. Overall, our work shows the potential benefits of incorporating capsules into deep learning models for more effective state representation learning.",1
"For the initial shoulder preoperative diagnosis, it is essential to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) bone mask from medical images, e.g., magnetic resonance (MR). However, obtaining high-resolution and dense medical scans is both costly and time-consuming. In addition, the imaging parameters for each 3D scan may vary from time to time and thus increase the variance between images. Therefore, it is practical to consider the bone extraction on low-resolution data which may influence imaging contrast and make the segmentation work difficult. In this paper, we present a joint segmentation for the humerus and scapula bones on a small dataset with low-contrast and high-shape-variability 3D MR images. The proposed network has a deep end-to-end architecture to obtain the initial 3D bone masks. Because the existing scarce and inaccurate human-labeled ground truth, we design a self-reinforced learning strategy to increase performance. By comparing with the non-reinforced segmentation and a classical multi-atlas method with joint label fusion, the proposed approach obtains better results.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in extracting detailed, high resolution anatomical models from medical images, particularly from Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data. Accurate segmentation of bones, such as the humerus and scapula, is crucial for many applications such as surgery planning, implant design, biomechanics analysis and anthropology research. However, accurate extraction of these bones from low contrast and high shape variability MR data remains challenging due to several factors, including image quality, patient positioning errors and variations in body composition. This work presents a novel methodology that effectively addresses these issues through the use of advanced post processing techniques combined with machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach uses preliminary segmentations generated by experienced radiologists along with advanced statistical methods to improve sensitivity and specificity. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate significant improvement over existing state of art algorithms, achieving highly accurate and precise segmentation performance even under extreme conditions of MR imaging data.

"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), lifelong reinforcement learning (LRL) has become increasingly important as researchers strive to create agents that can learn multiple tasks throughout their lifetime without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.

This paper presents a novel approach called Generative Memory (GenMem) which addresses these limitations by incorporating a generative model into traditional reactive memory systems used in RL algorithms. GenMem builds upon recent advances in variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate new, high quality states that maximize future reward expectations. We demonstrate through experimental results across several benchmark domains that using VAEs as part of GenMem leads to significant improvements over standard methods, achieving better performance on both short-term and long-term task goals. These findings have implications for developing more advanced AI agents capable of adapting to complex environments and handling long-term objectives.",1
"We present a unifying framework for designing and analysing distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms in terms of recursively estimating statistics of the return distribution. Our key insight is that DRL algorithms can be decomposed as the combination of some statistical estimator and a method for imputing a return distribution consistent with that set of statistics. With this new understanding, we are able to provide improved analyses of existing DRL algorithms as well as construct a new algorithm (EDRL) based upon estimation of the expectiles of the return distribution. We compare EDRL with existing methods on a variety of MDPs to illustrate concrete aspects of our analysis, and develop a deep RL variant of the algorithm, ER-DQN, which we evaluate on the Atari-57 suite of games.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), researchers often focus on developing algorithms that can learn policies by interacting with environments in order to maximize rewards. However, these algorithms typically rely on assumptions about the distributions of rewards and other quantities which may not hold in practice. Recent work has proposed using distributional RL (DRL) methods, which explicitly model these distributions and use them to guide policy optimization. This paper examines how samples from the environment can affect the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically considering three types of sampling: random sampling, importance weighted sampling, and return sampling. We analyze both offline and online versions of popular DRL algorithms and evaluate their performances under different sampling conditions. Our results suggest that choosing appropriate sampling techniques depends crucially on specific problem parameters such as discount factor, horizon length, action spaces size, etc. Overall, we demonstrate that careful consideration of sampling strategies can significantly impact the effectiveness of DRL algorithms.",1
"Since their introduction a year ago, distributional approaches to reinforcement learning (distributional RL) have produced strong results relative to the standard approach which models expected values (expected RL). However, aside from convergence guarantees, there have been few theoretical results investigating the reasons behind the improvements distributional RL provides. In this paper we begin the investigation into this fundamental question by analyzing the differences in the tabular, linear approximation, and non-linear approximation settings. We prove that in many realizations of the tabular and linear approximation settings, distributional RL behaves exactly the same as expected RL. In cases where the two methods behave differently, distributional RL can in fact hurt performance when it does not induce identical behaviour. We then continue with an empirical analysis comparing distributional and expected RL methods in control settings with non-linear approximators to tease apart where the improvements from distributional RL methods are coming from.",0

Our work aims to shed light on these differences by comparing EV and DistR in both theory and practice across several real-world applications. Through extensive experiments and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that each approach has unique strengths and weaknesses, making them better suited to different tasks and situations. In some cases, one method may outperform the other significantly, while in others they perform similarly. These findings provide valuable insights into how researchers can select the most appropriate RL algorithm for specific problems and guide future developments in the field of reinforcement learning.",1
"Reinforcement learning is a promising framework for solving control problems, but its use in practical situations is hampered by the fact that reward functions are often difficult to engineer. Specifying goals and tasks for autonomous machines, such as robots, is a significant challenge: conventionally, reward functions and goal states have been used to communicate objectives. But people can communicate objectives to each other simply by describing or demonstrating them. How can we build learning algorithms that will allow us to tell machines what we want them to do? In this work, we investigate the problem of grounding language commands as reward functions using inverse reinforcement learning, and argue that language-conditioned rewards are more transferable than language-conditioned policies to new environments. We propose language-conditioned reward learning (LC-RL), which grounds language commands as a reward function represented by a deep neural network. We demonstrate that our model learns rewards that transfer to novel tasks and environments on realistic, high-dimensional visual environments with natural language commands, whereas directly learning a language-conditioned policy leads to poor performance.",0
"The ability to interpret natural language instructions is essential for robots that operate in human environments. However, most instruction following algorithms assume a predefined set of goals, which may not align with the user's intentions. This research proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach to learn both the goals and policies directly from raw sensory inputs such as images. We use deep neural networks to encode visual input into compact representations that capture important features for task execution. Our IRL framework then infers the user's goals by maximizing their expected reward based on these feature encodings. To address challenges related to partial observability and stochasticity in real-world environments, we introduce novel methods to estimate rewards efficiently and robustly. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives while successfully generalizing to unseen scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using vision-based instruction following in complex robotics tasks and opens up new possibilities for enabling more flexible interaction between humans and robots.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown great success in a variety of control tasks. However, it is unclear how close we are to the vision of putting Deep RL into practice to solve real world problems. In particular, common practice in the field is to train policies on largely deterministic simulators and to evaluate algorithms through training performance alone, without a train/test distinction to ensure models generalise and are not overfitted. Moreover, it is not standard practice to check for generalisation under domain shift, although robustness to such system change between training and testing would be necessary for real-world Deep RL control, for example, in robotics. In this paper we study these issues by first characterising the sources of uncertainty that provide generalisation challenges in Deep RL. We then provide a new benchmark and thorough empirical evaluation of generalisation challenges for state of the art Deep RL methods. In particular, we show that, if generalisation is the goal, then common practice of evaluating algorithms based on their training performance leads to the wrong conclusions about algorithm choice. Finally, we evaluate several techniques for improving generalisation and draw conclusions about the most robust techniques to date.",0
"This paper presents an investigation into generalization abilities in continuous deep reinforcement learning (RL). Despite remarkable successes in RL, current methods still struggle with tasks that require transferring knowledge across different environments or situations. To address this issue, we explore approaches to improve the ability of RL agents to generalize beyond their training distribution. We propose novel techniques inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning, such as meta-learning with model ensemble and regularization. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods significantly enhance performance on standard benchmarks, showing better transferability among diverse environments or even new unseen ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals insights into how learned behaviors can vary between single-task versus multi-task settings and discuss implications for future research directions. Overall, this work contributes to understanding how generalization might be achieved in complex RL problems, paving the way for more robust and adaptive artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Robust MDPs (RMDPs) can be used to compute policies with provable worst-case guarantees in reinforcement learning. The quality and robustness of an RMDP solution are determined by the ambiguity set---the set of plausible transition probabilities---which is usually constructed as a multi-dimensional confidence region. Existing methods construct ambiguity sets as confidence regions using concentration inequalities which leads to overly conservative solutions. This paper proposes a new paradigm that can achieve better solutions with the same robustness guarantees without using confidence regions as ambiguity sets. To incorporate prior knowledge, our algorithms optimize the size and position of ambiguity sets using Bayesian inference. Our theoretical analysis shows the safety of the proposed method, and the empirical results demonstrate its practical promise.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in developing decision making frameworks that can provide robustness against uncertainty. Many approaches have focused on constructing confidence regions based on parameter estimates obtained from data samples or prior distributions. However, these methods suffer from limitations such as conservative underestimation of ambiguity sets resulting in suboptimal decisions. This paper presents a new methodology for constructing tight ambiguity sets that significantly reduces conservatism and improves decision quality in uncertain Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our approach leverages the strengths of both model-based planning and model-free reinforcement learning techniques by combining them into a single framework known as Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) with ambiguity sets (Amb-MBRL). We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our Amb-MBRL algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of decision quality while providing statistical guarantees over model uncertainties. Overall, this research contributes towards building more robust decision making systems by effectively handling complex dependencies among variables and alleviating the shortcomings of traditional ambiguity set construction methods.",1
"A reinforcement learning agent that needs to pursue different goals across episodes requires a goal-conditional policy. In addition to their potential to generalize desirable behavior to unseen goals, such policies may also enable higher-level planning based on subgoals. In sparse-reward environments, the capacity to exploit information about the degree to which an arbitrary goal has been achieved while another goal was intended appears crucial to enable sample efficient learning. However, reinforcement learning agents have only recently been endowed with such capacity for hindsight. In this paper, we demonstrate how hindsight can be introduced to policy gradient methods, generalizing this idea to a broad class of successful algorithms. Our experiments on a diverse selection of sparse-reward environments show that hindsight leads to a remarkable increase in sample efficiency.",0
"Policy gradient methods have become increasingly popular as a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm due to their sample efficiency and ability to scale to high dimensions. However, most policy gradient methods only consider the on-policy data generated by interacting with an environment using an initial policy that might be suboptimal. This means that these methods may miss out on important aspects of the solution space that could lead to better performance. In our work, we propose ""hindsight policy gradients"", which incorporate both on-policy and off-policy data into the optimization process by considering imaginary goals achieved after each step of interaction with the environment. Our method uses temporal difference error to calculate the advantages of achieving hindsight goals at any time during the trajectory, enabling the agent to learn from successful behaviors even if they were not chosen originally. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive simulations across multiple domains and compare against state-of-the-art policies, showing significant improvements in both speed and quality of learning. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights into how the use of hindsight can shape the exploration behaviour of agents, leading them towards more effective strategies. Overall, our results suggest that the integration of hindsight knowledge significantly enhances the performance of policy gradient algorithms, making it a promising direction for future research in deep reinforcement learning.",1
"Building agents to interact with the web would allow for significant improvements in knowledge understanding and representation learning. However, web navigation tasks are difficult for current deep reinforcement learning (RL) models due to the large discrete action space and the varying number of actions between the states. In this work, we introduce DOM-Q-NET, a novel architecture for RL-based web navigation to address both of these problems. It parametrizes Q functions with separate networks for different action categories: clicking a DOM element and typing a string input. Our model utilizes a graph neural network to represent the tree-structured HTML of a standard web page. We demonstrate the capabilities of our model on the MiniWoB environment where we can match or outperform existing work without the use of expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we show 2x improvements in sample efficiency when training in the multi-task setting, allowing our model to transfer learned behaviours across tasks.",0

Our method, called DOM-Q-NET, uses a combination of natural language processing and deep learning to identify relevant parts of codebases and generate targeted tests for those areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous evaluation on several real-world projects, showing improvements over traditional testing approaches in terms of code coverage and defect detection rates. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the use of artificial intelligence for improving software development practices and ensuring high-quality results.",1
"Thompson sampling (TS) is a class of algorithms for sequential decision-making, which requires maintaining a posterior distribution over a model. However, calculating exact posterior distributions is intractable for all but the simplest models. Consequently, efficient computation of an approximate posterior distribution is a crucial problem for scalable TS with complex models, such as neural networks. In this paper, we use distribution optimization techniques to approximate the posterior distribution, solved via Wasserstein gradient flows. Based on the framework, a principled particle-optimization algorithm is developed for TS to approximate the posterior efficiently. Our approach is scalable and does not make explicit distribution assumptions on posterior approximations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real large-scale data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.",0
"This is a paper on developing scalable Thompson sampling algorithms using optimal transport techniques. The problem of finding scalable Thompson sampling algorithms has become increasingly important as large scale data sets have become more common. While there exist several Thompson sampling algorithms that can work well on small datasets, they often fail at scaling up due to computational intractability issues. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel approach based on solving an optimal transportation problem using linear programming methods. By leveraging this approach, our algorithm can provide near-optimal solutions while remaining computationally efficient even for very large datasets. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple domains. As such, our contributions bridge a critical gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementations of Bayesian inference with big data.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained a lot of attention in recent years, and has been proven to be able to play Atari games and Go at or above human levels. However, those games are assumed to have a small fixed number of actions and could be trained with a simple CNN network. In this paper, we study a special class of Asian popular card games called Dou Di Zhu, in which two adversarial groups of agents must consider numerous card combinations at each time step, leading to huge number of actions. We propose a novel method to handle combinatorial actions, which we call combinational Q-learning (CQL). We employ a two-stage network to reduce action space and also leverage order-invariant max-pooling operations to extract relationships between primitive actions. Results show that our method prevails over state-of-the art methods like naive Q-learning and A3C. We develop an easy-to-use card game environments and train all agents adversarially from sractch, with only knowledge of game rules and verify that our agents are comparative to humans. Our code to reproduce all reported results will be available online.",0

"We present a method for fast training of vision based control policies on real robots. The key idea behind our method is to perform multi-task Reinforcement Learning with auxiliary tasks that differ not only in the reward to be optimized but also in the state-space in which they operate. In particular, we allow auxiliary task policies to utilize task features that are available only at training-time. This allows for fast learning of auxiliary policies, which subsequently generate good data for training the main, vision-based control policies. This method can be seen as an extension of the Scheduled Auxiliary Control (SAC-X) framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by using both a simulated and real-world Ball-in-a-Cup game controlled by a robot arm. In simulation, our approach leads to significant learning speed-ups when compared to standard SAC-X. On the real robot we show that the task can be learned from-scratch, i.e., with no transfer from simulation and no imitation learning. Videos of our learned policies running on the real robot can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/rss-2019-sawyer-bic/.",0
"This paper presents a method for simultaneously learning both vision-based control policies and feature-based control policies for real-world ball-in-a-cup tasks. We propose a novel architecture that uses deep reinforcement learning to learn two sets of control policies: one set based on raw image inputs from a camera, and another set based on features extracted from the images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach allows agents to switch seamlessly between these two policy types depending on which provides better performance at any given time step during training. The trained models were able to achieve state-of-the-art results in challenging benchmark tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method for combining vision- and feature-based control strategies in real-time decision making for robotics applications.",1
"The goal of task transfer in reinforcement learning is migrating the action policy of an agent to the target task from the source task. Given their successes on robotic action planning, current methods mostly rely on two requirements: exactly-relevant expert demonstrations or the explicitly-coded cost function on target task, both of which, however, are inconvenient to obtain in practice. In this paper, we relax these two strong conditions by developing a novel task transfer framework where the expert preference is applied as a guidance. In particular, we alternate the following two steps: Firstly, letting experts apply pre-defined preference rules to select related expert demonstrates for the target task. Secondly, based on the selection result, we learn the target cost function and trajectory distribution simultaneously via enhanced Adversarial MaxEnt IRL and generate more trajectories by the learned target distribution for the next preference selection. The theoretical analysis on the distribution learning and convergence of the proposed algorithm are provided. Extensive simulations on several benchmarks have been conducted for further verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0

"In this paper, we propose a new learning technique named message-dropout to improve the performance for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning under two application scenarios: 1) classical multi-agent reinforcement learning with direct message communication among agents and 2) centralized training with decentralized execution. In the first application scenario of multi-agent systems in which direct message communication among agents is allowed, the message-dropout technique drops out the received messages from other agents in a block-wise manner with a certain probability in the training phase and compensates for this effect by multiplying the weights of the dropped-out block units with a correction probability. The applied message-dropout technique effectively handles the increased input dimension in multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication and makes learning robust against communication errors in the execution phase. In the second application scenario of centralized training with decentralized execution, we particularly consider the application of the proposed message-dropout to Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), which uses a centralized critic to train a decentralized actor for each agent. We evaluate the proposed message-dropout technique for several games, and numerical results show that the proposed message-dropout technique with proper dropout rate improves the reinforcement learning performance significantly in terms of the training speed and the steady-state performance in the execution phase.",0
"In recent years, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning has become increasingly important in areas such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and computer games. However, training multi-agent systems can be challenging due to the computational complexity and sample inefficiency associated with traditional methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called message-dropout that significantly improves both stability and efficiency during training. Our method enables agents to learn better policies by selectively ignoring messages from other agents based on their confidence levels. By applying dropout regularization to agent messages, our algorithm effectively reduces overfitting and increases robustness to noise while maintaining good performance. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on popular benchmark tasks that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of speed and quality of learning.",1
"Ordinary stochastic neural networks mostly rely on the expected values of their weights to make predictions, whereas the induced noise is mostly used to capture the uncertainty, prevent overfitting and slightly boost the performance through test-time averaging. In this paper, we introduce variance layers, a different kind of stochastic layers. Each weight of a variance layer follows a zero-mean distribution and is only parameterized by its variance. We show that such layers can learn surprisingly well, can serve as an efficient exploration tool in reinforcement learning tasks and provide a decent defense against adversarial attacks. We also show that a number of conventional Bayesian neural networks naturally converge to such zero-mean posteriors. We observe that in these cases such zero-mean parameterization leads to a much better training objective than conventional parameterizations where the mean is being learned.",0
"Abstract: In many areas of study, researchers have come to rely on variance networks as powerful tools for analyzing and predicting complex systems. However, these methods can often fail to live up to expectations, leading to disappointment and frustration among practitioners. This paper seeks to address this issue by exploring the limitations of existing approaches and proposing new techniques that can overcome them. By identifying key challenges faced by current variance network analysis, we aim to provide insights into how these models can be improved and better applied to real-world problems. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute towards building more accurate, effective, and reliable methods for working with uncertainty and variability in data.

"In many real-world learning scenarios, features are only acquirable at a cost constrained under a budget. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cost-sensitive feature acquisition at the prediction-time. The suggested method acquires features incrementally based on a context-aware feature-value function. We formulate the problem in the reinforcement learning paradigm, and introduce a reward function based on the utility of each feature. Specifically, MC dropout sampling is used to measure expected variations of the model uncertainty which is used as a feature-value function. Furthermore, we suggest sharing representations between the class predictor and value function estimator networks. The suggested approach is completely online and is readily applicable to stream learning setups. The solution is evaluated on three different datasets including the well-known MNIST dataset as a benchmark as well as two cost-sensitive datasets: Yahoo Learning to Rank and a dataset in the medical domain for diabetes classification. According to the results, the proposed method is able to efficiently acquire features and make accurate predictions.",0
In modern applications there has been a growing need for machines to make decisions at runtime based on data streams. Such systems face severe resource constraints due to energy consumption of computations as well as the limited battery life available. To address these issues we have explored opportunistic learning techniques that learn incrementally from the stream while operating under stringent budget constraints. Our proposed technique works by first identifying which instances from the arriving data stream satisfy both correctness (with respect to some task) but also simultaneously have low cost (defined via an appropriate metric). For such instances our method stores all incoming features along with their corresponding class label and gradually builds up an efficient decision rule using only those stored instances satisfying correctness and cost requirements. We show on several real world benchmark datasets how such an approach significantly outperforms existing state of art methods like mini-batch gradient descent while operating within constrained budgets.,1
"Finite-horizon lookahead policies are abundantly used in Reinforcement Learning and demonstrate impressive empirical success. Usually, the lookahead policies are implemented with specific planning methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (e.g. in AlphaZero). Referring to the planning problem as tree search, a reasonable practice in these implementations is to back up the value only at the leaves while the information obtained at the root is not leveraged other than for updating the policy. Here, we question the potency of this approach. Namely, the latter procedure is non-contractive in general, and its convergence is not guaranteed. Our proposed enhancement is straightforward and simple: use the return from the optimal tree path to back up the values at the descendants of the root. This leads to a $\gamma^h$-contracting procedure, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $h$ is the tree depth. To establish our results, we first introduce a notion called \emph{multiple-step greedy consistency}. We then provide convergence rates for two algorithmic instantiations of the above enhancement in the presence of noise injected to both the tree search stage and value estimation stage.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), tree search methods have proven to be effective tools for finding high-quality policies in complex environments. However, no single algorithm can solve all problems efficiently, and combining multiple tree search algorithms may improve performance across different domains. This paper proposes several ways to combine multiple tree search algorithms in RL: parallel rollouts, hybrid search, weighted averaging, committee voting, and cooperative search. We evaluate these combinations on benchmark RL problems and show that some combinations outperform their individual components. Our results demonstrate the potential benefits of combining multiple tree search methods in RL and provide guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate combination strategies. Additionally, we identify promising directions for future research, such as developing adaptive combination techniques and exploring new criteria for selecting ensemble members. Overall, our work contributes to the development of more efficient and robust RL algorithms that are able to tackle real-world problems.",1
"Deep learning has achieved remarkable successes in solving challenging reinforcement learning (RL) problems when dense reward function is provided. However, in sparse reward environment it still often suffers from the need to carefully shape reward function to guide policy optimization. This limits the applicability of RL in the real world since both reinforcement learning and domain-specific knowledge are required. It is therefore of great practical importance to develop algorithms which can learn from a binary signal indicating successful task completion or other unshaped, sparse reward signals. We propose a novel method called competitive experience replay, which efficiently supplements a sparse reward by placing learning in the context of an exploration competition between a pair of agents. Our method complements the recently proposed hindsight experience replay (HER) by inducing an automatic exploratory curriculum. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of reaching various goal locations in an ant maze and manipulating objects with a robotic arm. Each task provides only binary rewards indicating whether or not the goal is achieved. Our method asymmetrically augments these sparse rewards for a pair of agents each learning the same task, creating a competitive game designed to drive exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method leads to faster converge and improved task performance.",0
"Artificial intelligence has come a long way since its inception, and one area where there has been significant progress is in game playthrough analysis. Game developers often record players' interactions with their games so they can analyze how users interact with different features. However, these recorded replays provide limited data compared to human experts, who have access to more advanced tools like external cameras and screen capture software.  In order to bridge the gap between human observation and traditional analytics methods, we propose the use of competitive experience replay (CER). CER allows players to share experiences from a match with each other, including game state changes, chat messages, and event triggers such as ""A killed B."" By incorporating human perspectives into game replays, developers gain additional insight into how players actually experience their games.  Our proposed method combines machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to automatically create readable summaries of player actions within the shared video stream. These summaries can then be used by developers to gain insights that were previously unavailable through standard analytics alone. Our system works by first detecting relevant events during a match using image recognition technology. Then, it uses NLP techniques to generate text descriptions of player actions. Finally, it applies machine learning models trained on large sets of labeled data to predict which parts of the recording contain notable moments. This approach helps developers quickly identify and focus on interesting events while minimizing time spent watching uneventful footage. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our CER framework across multiple titles spanning diverse genres, demonstrating both quantitative improvements over existing methods and qualitative advantages. We conclude that adding human intuition to game analytics provides deeper insights and greater value to developers interested in improving user experience.",1
"When using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms it is common, given a large state space, to introduce some form of approximation architecture for the value function (VF). The exact form of this architecture can have a significant effect on an agent's performance, however, and determining a suitable approximation architecture can often be a highly complex task. Consequently there is currently interest among researchers in the potential for allowing RL algorithms to adaptively generate (i.e. to learn) approximation architectures. One relatively unexplored method of adapting approximation architectures involves using feedback regarding the frequency with which an agent has visited certain states to guide which areas of the state space to approximate with greater detail. In this article we will: (a) informally discuss the potential advantages offered by such methods; (b) introduce a new algorithm based on such methods which adapts a state aggregation approximation architecture on-line and is designed for use in conjunction with SARSA; (c) provide theoretical results, in a policy evaluation setting, regarding this particular algorithm's complexity, convergence properties and potential to reduce VF error; and finally (d) test experimentally the extent to which this algorithm can improve performance given a number of different test problems. Taken together our results suggest that our algorithm (and potentially such methods more generally) can provide a versatile and computationally lightweight means of significantly boosting RL performance given suitable conditions which are commonly encountered in practice.",0
"UBFA is a new method that adapts basis functions in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without any labeled data, only using unlabeled demonstrations from experts. Previous methods have used handcrafted features or required expensive labeling for adaptation. We show that even with just unlabeled expert demos, our algorithm can improve sample efficiency by orders of magnitude over standard RL and other unsupervised RL baselines across three challenging environments: Mountain Car, CartPole, and VizDoom. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different parameters on the agent's performance, including the number of expert demonstrations provided, as well as how many actions each expert takes before providing a new batch of trajectories. Overall, our work shows that effective adaptation without supervision is possible, opening up exciting opportunities for improving RL agents in complex domains.",1
"Many complex domains, such as robotics control and real-time strategy (RTS) games, require an agent to learn a continuous control. In the former, an agent learns a policy over $\mathbb{R}^d$ and in the latter, over a discrete set of actions each of which is parametrized by a continuous parameter. Such problems are naturally solved using policy based reinforcement learning (RL) methods, but unfortunately these often suffer from high variance leading to instability and slow convergence. Unnecessary variance is introduced whenever policies over bounded action spaces are modeled using distributions with unbounded support by applying a transformation $T$ to the sampled action before execution in the environment. Recently, the variance reduced clipped action policy gradient (CAPG) was introduced for actions in bounded intervals, but to date no variance reduced methods exist when the action is a direction, something often seen in RTS games. To this end we introduce the angular policy gradient (APG), a stochastic policy gradient method for directional control. With the marginal policy gradients family of estimators we present a unified analysis of the variance reduction properties of APG and CAPG; our results provide a stronger guarantee than existing analyses for CAPG. Experimental results on a popular RTS game and a navigation task show that the APG estimator offers a substantial improvement over the standard policy gradient.",0
"This can make writing more concise if you assume that the reader has already read the summary in the previous paragraph and only includes material from this point onwards. As such, we begin by stating our main contributions, then briefly describe how policy gradients differ from value function gradients before introducing our new family of estimators called marginal policy gradients. We present theoretical results showing their statistical efficiency and robustness in bounded action spaces without the need for knowledge of Lipschitz constants. Our experiments show competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods across continuous control tasks in MuJoCo and Atari games, as well as discrete action space settings with binary decisions for sentiment analysis. Lastly, we provide further discussion on future directions for extensions and limitations of our methodology.",1
"We present the first model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to synthesise policies for an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), such that a linear time property is satisfied. The given temporal property is converted into a Limit Deterministic Buchi Automaton (LDBA) and a robust reward function is defined over the state-action pairs of the MDP according to the resulting LDBA. With this reward function, the policy synthesis procedure is ""constrained"" by the given specification. These constraints guide the MDP exploration so as to minimize the solution time by only considering the portion of the MDP that is relevant to satisfaction of the LTL property. This improves performance and scalability of the proposed method by avoiding an exhaustive update over the whole state space while the efficiency of standard methods such as dynamic programming is hindered by excessive memory requirements, caused by the need to store a full-model in memory. Additionally, we show that the RL procedure sets up a local value iteration method to efficiently calculate the maximum probability of satisfying the given property, at any given state of the MDP. We prove that our algorithm is guaranteed to find a policy whose traces probabilistically satisfy the LTL property if such a policy exists, and additionally we show that our method produces reasonable control policies even when the LTL property cannot be satisfied. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated via a set of numerical examples. We observe an improvement of one order of magnitude in the number of iterations required for the synthesis compared to existing approaches.",0

"Hierarchical reinforcement learning deals with the problem of breaking down large tasks into meaningful sub-tasks. Autonomous discovery of these sub-tasks has remained a challenging problem. We propose a novel method of learning sub-tasks by combining paradigms of routing in computer networks and graph based skill discovery within the options framework to define meaningful sub-goals. We apply the recent advancements of learning embeddings using Riemannian optimisation in the hyperbolic space to embed the state set into the hyperbolic space and create a model of the environment. In doing so we enforce a global topology on the states and are able to exploit this topology to learn meaningful sub-tasks. We demonstrate empirically, both in discrete and continuous domains, how these embeddings can improve the learning of meaningful sub-tasks.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training agents to perform complex tasks such as game playing and autonomous robotics. One key challenge faced by RL algorithms is the need to learn optimal policies that select actions from large, high-dimensional state spaces. This task can become even more difficult if the environment contains hierarchies, where options must be selected before specific actions can be taken. In this work, we propose using hyperbolic embeddings to represent states and actions in the context of hierarchical RL. Our approach provides several benefits over traditional methods: firstly, hyperbolic representations allow us to compactly encode very high-dimensional data while preserving important geometric properties; secondly, our algorithm can efficiently compute option values using these embeddings, leading to improved performance on benchmark tasks. We demonstrate through experiments on a range of environments that our method outperforms existing approaches, particularly in domains with many available options. Overall, our results suggest that hyperbolic embeddings could play a key role in enabling efficient, effective exploration of large action spaces in the context of hierarchical RL.",1
"In real-world scenarios, the observation data for reinforcement learning with continuous control is commonly noisy and part of it may be dynamically missing over time, which violates the assumption of many current methods developed for this. We addressed the issue within the framework of partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) using a model-based method, in which the transition model is estimated from the incomplete and noisy observations using a newly proposed surrogate loss function with local approximation, while the policy and value function is learned with the help of belief imputation. For the latter purpose, a generative model is constructed and is seamlessly incorporated into the belief updating procedure of POMDP, which enables robust execution even under a significant incompleteness and noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a collection of benchmark tasks, showing that our approach outperforms several compared methods under various challenging scenarios.",0
"While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great successes across many domains, it still faces challenges particularly in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). These problems arise from incomplete observations as well as noisy perceptual signals, which hinder agents' ability to make accurate predictions and decisions. Existing solutions have typically relied on perfect or near-perfect state representations or auxiliary tasks like uncertainty estimation. This study introduces a novel method that addresses these limitations by using domain randomization to train policies robust to incomplete and noisy observations without explicit reliance on these components. We evaluate our approach in diverse environments, demonstrating its efficacy compared against baseline methods. Our work represents a significant step toward building adaptive and resilient RL systems capable of handling real-world complexities effectively.",1
"We propose the use of Bayesian networks, which provide both a mean value and an uncertainty estimate as output, to enhance the safety of learned control policies under circumstances in which a test-time input differs significantly from the training set. Our algorithm combines reinforcement learning and end-to-end imitation learning to simultaneously learn a control policy as well as a threshold over the predictive uncertainty of the learned model, with no hand-tuning required. Corrective action, such as a return of control to the model predictive controller or human expert, is taken when the uncertainty threshold is exceeded. We validate our method on fully-observable and vision-based partially-observable systems using cart-pole and autonomous driving simulations using deep convolutional Bayesian neural networks. We demonstrate that our method is robust to uncertainty resulting from varying system dynamics as well as from partial state observability.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for improving the safety and efficiency of end-to-end model predictive control (MPC) systems by utilizing deep reinforcement learning techniques. End-to-end MPC refers to the use of neural network models directly as controllers without relying on explicit feedback loops. While recent advances have shown promising results, existing methods suffer from limitations such as lack of robustness, poor generalization ability, and potential instability.  To address these issues, we propose safe end-to-end imitation learning for MPC (SEIL-MPC), which combines supervised learning based on expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning guided by constraints. Our approach involves training a neural network controller using both task-specific objective functions learned through demonstration data and additional constraints that ensure stability and feasibility under worst-case scenarios. We show how SEIL-MPC can handle nonlinear dynamics, state uncertainty, and complex environments while remaining more efficient than traditional MPC algorithms.  Through extensive experimental evaluations across multiple benchmark tasks, including numerical simulations and real-world robotics applications, our proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of performance, safety, and computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SEIL-MPC provides interpretable explainability compared to black-box neural network controllers, making it easier to identify and debug any safety concerns during deployment. Finally, our work opens up new possibilities for applying deep RL to real-world control problems where safety guarantees are critical.",1
"As the most successful variant and improvement for Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), proximal policy optimization (PPO) has been widely applied across various domains with several advantages: efficient data utilization, easy implementation, and good parallelism. In this paper, a first-order gradient reinforcement learning algorithm called Policy Optimization with Penalized Point Probability Distance (POP3D), which is a lower bound to the square of total variance divergence is proposed as another powerful variant. Firstly, we talk about the shortcomings of several commonly used algorithms, by which our method is partly motivated. Secondly, we address to overcome these shortcomings by applying POP3D. Thirdly, we dive into its mechanism from the perspective of solution manifold. Finally, we make quantitative comparisons among several state-of-the-art algorithms based on common benchmarks. Simulation results show that POP3D is highly competitive compared with PPO. Besides, our code is released in https://github.com/paperwithcode/pop3d.",0
"Title: ""Policy Optimization Using Penalized Point Probability Distance""  This paper presents a new approach to policy optimization that offers an alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our method uses a novel objective function called penalized point probability distance which combines pointwise probability distance and an additional penalty term, promoting policies with higher success rates while discouraging unsuccessful behaviors. This allows for more efficient exploration during training and better generalization across different environments. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks, including MuJoCo locomotion tasks and Atari games, demonstrating improved performance compared to PPO. These results suggest that penalized point probability distance could be a valuable tool for reinforcement learning researchers seeking to optimize their algorithms. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on how we think about policy optimization and highlights the potential benefits of using a different type of objective function.",1
"Employing one or more additional classifiers to break the self-learning loop in tracing-by-detection has gained considerable attention. Most of such trackers merely utilize the redundancy to address the accumulating label error in the tracking loop, and suffer from high computational complexity as well as tracking challenges that may interrupt all classifiers (e.g. temporal occlusions). We propose the active co-tracking framework, in which the main classifier of the tracker labels samples of the video sequence, and only consults auxiliary classifier when it is uncertain. Based on the source of the uncertainty and the differences of two classifiers (e.g. accuracy, speed, update frequency, etc.), different policies should be taken to exchange the information between two classifiers. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning approach to find the appropriate policy by considering the state of the tracker in a specific sequence. The proposed method yields promising results in comparison to the best tracking-by-detection approaches.",0
"This article proposes a new method for visual co-tracking that balances both short memory (e.g., recent sensor measurements) and long memory (e.g., past experience and knowledge). Existing methods often prioritize either short or long memory, which can lead to suboptimal results. Our approach combines them in a principled manner, improving performance on challenging scenarios where objects move quickly or appear occluded. We use deep reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning, to optimize our tracker. Results show significant improvement over competitive baselines on a wide range of datasets and metrics. Implications for realworld applications such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and augmented reality are discussed.",1
"We propose a new policy iteration theory as an important extension of soft policy iteration and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), one of the most efficient model free algorithms for deep reinforcement learning. Supported by the new theory, arbitrary entropy measures that generalize Shannon entropy, such as Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy, can be utilized to properly randomize action selection while fulfilling the goal of maximizing expected long-term rewards. Our theory gives birth to two new algorithms, i.e., Tsallis entropy Actor-Critic (TAC) and Renyi entropy Actor-Critic (RAC). Theoretical analysis shows that these algorithms can be more effective than SAC. Moreover, they pave the way for us to develop a new Ensemble Actor-Critic (EAC) algorithm in this paper that features the use of a bootstrap mechanism for deep environment exploration as well as a new value-function based mechanism for high-level action selection. Empirically we show that TAC, RAC and EAC can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmark control tasks, outperforming SAC and several cutting-edge learning algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and effectiveness.",0
"Title: Enhancing General Entropy and Environmental Exploration through Ensemble Based Off-policy Actor-critic Approaches in Deep Reinforcement Learning.  This study investigates innovative ways to improve performance in deep reinforcement learning by integrating ensemble based off-policy actor-critic approaches into the model. We aim to enhance general entropy and environmental exploration capabilities within these models. The research focuses on improving current limitations and challenges faced by existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms by leveraging the strengths of both off-policy training methods and actor-critic architectures. By examining how different ensemble techniques can be combined with off-policy approaches, we seek to gain deeper insights into their impact on overall agent behavior and performance. Our findings indicate that the use of ensembles in combination with off-policy strategies leads to more effective environment exploration and higher levels of general entropy. These results provide promising opportunities for further advancements in deep reinforcement learning research.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has recently gained a focus on problems where policy or value functions are independent of goals. Evidence exists that the sampling of goals has a strong effect on the learning performance, but there is a lack of general mechanisms that focus on optimizing the goal sampling process. In this work, we present a simple and general goal masking method that also allows us to estimate a goal's difficulty level and thus realize a curriculum learning approach for deep RL. Our results indicate that focusing on goals with a medium difficulty level is appropriate for deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods, while an ""aim for the stars and reach the moon-strategy"", where hard goals are sampled much more often than simple goals, leads to the best learning performance in cases where DDPG is combined with for hindsight experience replay (HER). We demonstrate that the approach significantly outperforms standard goal sampling for different robotic object manipulation problems.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing artificial intelligence agents that can learn from experience through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, the efficiency and scalability of DRL algorithms have been limited by their reliance on handcrafted reward functions. One approach to address this issue is to use pretext tasks, which aim to improve learning efficiency by providing auxiliary goals for the agent to achieve during training. These pretext tasks can take many forms, but they all share the common objective of helping the agent discover important features in the environment and improving its performance. Our work proposes a novel method called ""curriculum goal masking"" (CGM), which extends the idea of using pretext tasks by introducing random perturbations to the available goals at each step of training. This ensures that the agent learns to focus on relevant aspects of the problem while maintaining robustness against distributional shift caused by these perturbations. We evaluate CGM on several benchmark domains and show that it leads to improved sample efficiency and generalization compared to state-of-the-art DRL methods without any task-specific modifications. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of curriculum goal masking as a powerful tool for enhancing the learning capabilities of deep reinforcement learning agents.",1
"Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to learning robot controllers. It has recently been shown that algorithms based on finite-difference estimates of the policy gradient are competitive with algorithms based on the policy gradient theorem. We propose a theoretical framework for understanding this phenomenon. Our key insight is that many dynamical systems (especially those of interest in robot control tasks) are \emph{nearly deterministic}---i.e., they can be modeled as a deterministic system with a small stochastic perturbation. We show that for such systems, finite-difference estimates of the policy gradient can have substantially lower variance than estimates based on the policy gradient theorem. We interpret these results in the context of counterfactual estimation. Finally, we empirically evaluate our insights in an experiment on the inverted pendulum.",0
"Sampling is ubiquitous in solving hard decision problems under uncertainty. In particular, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a powerful framework for modeling sequential decision making processes with unknown transition dynamics. To solve MDPs with continuous state spaces, Monte Carlo methods based on sampling trajectories from the MDP have been popular. Despite their widespread use, such sample-based algorithms often suffer from high variance due to sampling errors caused by finite time horizons and limited samples, thus requiring large sample sizes to achieve good accuracy. Furthermore, many real world systems exhibit nearly deterministic behavior over short time horizons but become increasingly random as the horizon lengthens. Henceforth we call these kinds of system “nearly deterministic.” As far as we know, there has been no prior work that quantifies sample complexity of estimating policy gradients for nearly deterministic dynamical systems. In our new work we make progress towards filling this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of different estimation techniques including bootstrapping, which can reduce sample requirements. Our analysis suggests that bootstrap confidence intervals can yield conservative error estimates compared to standard nonparametric interval estimation without resampling, especially when relying only on small data sets. We illustrate how bootstrap error bars change with increasing number of rollouts and compare bootstrap results against full batch gradient evaluations using rollout data with small time steps, finding improved performance at increased computational cost. Additionally, we study the impact of correlation structure within the data on the efficacy of both types of error bounds. Empirical experiments confirm the importance of considering the underlying structure present in the system dynamics through careful parameterization of our models. Ultimately, these findings demonstrate how leveraging additional knowledge about the problem domain improves sample efficiency, leading t",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel conditional-generative-adversarial-nets-based image captioning framework as an extension of traditional reinforcement-learning (RL)-based encoder-decoder architecture. To deal with the inconsistent evaluation problem among different objective language metrics, we are motivated to design some ""discriminator"" networks to automatically and progressively determine whether generated caption is human described or machine generated. Two kinds of discriminator architectures (CNN and RNN-based structures) are introduced since each has its own advantages. The proposed algorithm is generic so that it can enhance any existing RL-based image captioning framework and we show that the conventional RL training method is just a special case of our approach. Empirically, we show consistent improvements over all language evaluation metrics for different state-of-the-art image captioning models. In addition, the well-trained discriminators can also be viewed as objective image captioning evaluators",0
"""Image caption generation is a challenging task that involves generating natural language descriptions of images. In recent years, deep learning models have achieved great success in image captioning by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as feature extractors and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling. However, these methods suffer from limited diversity and often generate similar captions for different inputs. To address this issue, we propose a new approach based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs).  Our CGAN-based model consists of two components: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator produces diverse captions conditioned on the input image, while the discriminator evaluates the quality of the generated captions. We train both networks adversarially, where the generator attempts to generate realistic captions that fool the discriminator, while the discriminator strives to distinguish fake captions from real ones. By using such a competition framework, our model can effectively synthesize high-quality captions with less diversity loss compared to existing approaches.  We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, including MSCOCO, Flickr30K, and SBU, and achieve state-of-the-art results on all metrics. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method generates more descriptive and accurate captions than other baseline systems. Additionally, we perform human evaluation studies and obtain promising feedback from domain experts, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.  In summary, our work introduces a novel conditional generative adversarial framework for image captioning, which significantly improves upon existing methods in terms of quality, diversity, and human judgment. This research paves the way for future advancements in automatic image description, benefiting numerous applications such as assistive technologies, multimedia retrieval, and content creation.""",1
"Sparse reward is one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning (RL). Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) attempts to address this issue by converting a failed experience to a successful one by relabeling the goals. Despite its effectiveness, HER has limited applicability because it lacks a compact and universal goal representation. We present Augmenting experienCe via TeacheR's adviCE (ACTRCE), an efficient reinforcement learning technique that extends the HER framework using natural language as the goal representation. We first analyze the differences among goal representation, and show that ACTRCE can efficiently solve difficult reinforcement learning problems in challenging 3D navigation tasks, whereas HER with non-language goal representation failed to learn. We also show that with language goal representations, the agent can generalize to unseen instructions, and even generalize to instructions with unseen lexicons. We further demonstrate it is crucial to use hindsight advice to solve challenging tasks, and even small amount of advice is sufficient for the agent to achieve good performance.",0
"This paper presents the use of human advice from teachers as a means of augmenting experience for multi-goal reinforcement learning agents. We show that incorporating teacher feedback can significantly improve performance on multiple tasks simultaneously through direct manipulation of intrinsic motivation towards achieving different goals within one overall objective. Our approach allows for both short-term reward maximization and improved guidance that encourages exploration towards finding all solutions. By leveraging human feedback, our algorithm effectively learns and adapts across varying domains while demonstrating efficient solution strategies that would otherwise prove difficult without such assistance. Furthermore, we provide analysis on how using expert advice affects agent behavior by comparing against several baseline methods and evaluating their convergence rate and quality of solutions found. The findings presented here demonstrate the effectiveness of employing external knowledge sources during training to enhance the efficiency and breadth of reinforcement learning algorithms.",1
"We study active object tracking, where a tracker takes visual observations (i.e., frame sequences) as input and produces the corresponding camera control signals as output (e.g., move forward, turn left, etc.). Conventional methods tackle tracking and camera control tasks separately, and the resulting system is difficult to tune jointly. These methods also require significant human efforts for image labeling and expensive trial-and-error system tuning in the real world. To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an end-to-end solution via deep reinforcement learning. A ConvNet-LSTM function approximator is adopted for the direct frame-to-action prediction. We further propose an environment augmentation technique and a customized reward function, which are crucial for successful training. The tracker trained in simulators (ViZDoom and Unreal Engine) demonstrates good generalization behaviors in the case of unseen object moving paths, unseen object appearances, unseen backgrounds, and distracting objects. The system is robust and can restore tracking after occasional lost of the target being tracked. We also find that the tracking ability, obtained solely from simulators, can potentially transfer to real-world scenarios. We demonstrate successful examples of such transfer, via experiments over the VOT dataset and the deployment of a real-world robot using the proposed active tracker trained in simulation.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing active object tracking methods that can effectively handle real-world challenges such as occlusions, illumination changes, and camera movements. Traditional approaches typically rely on handcrafted features and predefined models which may struggle to adapt to these diverse scenarios. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that learns to track objects directly from raw pixel data without any human intervention. Our approach enables continuous interaction between the tracker and the environment by exploring different search regions guided by RL feedback signals. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, our results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across various challenging situations encountered in practice. Overall, this work presents a step towards achieving reliable real-time tracking systems deployable under uncontrolled conditions, showcasing the potential benefits of integrating machine intelligence into computer vision applications with high societal impact.",1
"To widen their accessibility and increase their utility, intelligent agents must be able to learn complex behaviors as specified by (non-expert) human users. Moreover, they will need to learn these behaviors within a reasonable amount of time while efficiently leveraging the sparse feedback a human trainer is capable of providing. Recent work has shown that human feedback can be characterized as a critique of an agent's current behavior rather than as an alternative reward signal to be maximized, culminating in the COnvergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH) algorithm for making direct policy updates based on human feedback. Our work builds on COACH, moving to a setting where the agent's policy is represented by a deep neural network. We employ a series of modifications on top of the original COACH algorithm that are critical for successfully learning behaviors from high-dimensional observations, while also satisfying the constraint of obtaining reduced sample complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Deep COACH algorithm in the rich 3D world of Minecraft with an agent that learns to complete tasks by mapping from raw pixels to actions using only real-time human feedback in 10-15 minutes of interaction.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to deep reinforcement learning that leverages policy-dependent human feedback to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training agents in complex environments. Traditional reinforcement learning methods often rely on sparse rewards or indirect feedback, which can make training difficult and time-consuming. Our method addresses these limitations by allowing humans to provide direct feedback on the agent's actions, taking into account their impact on both short-term goals and long-term objectives. We demonstrate through extensive experiments how our approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms across a range of challenging benchmark tasks. By combining the strengths of human intuition and machine learning, we show that deep RL from policy-dependent human feedback holds great potential for solving real-world problems requiring complex decision making under uncertainty.",1
"In reinforcement learning, a decision needs to be made at some point as to whether it is worthwhile to carry on with the learning process or to terminate it. In many such situations, stochastic elements are often present which govern the occurrence of rewards, with the sequential occurrences of positive rewards randomly interleaved with negative rewards. For most practical learners, the learning is considered useful if the number of positive rewards always exceeds the negative ones. A situation that often calls for learning termination is when the number of negative rewards exceeds the number of positive rewards. However, while this seems reasonable, the error of premature termination, whereby termination is enacted along with the conclusion of learning failure despite the positive rewards eventually far outnumber the negative ones, can be significant. In this paper, using combinatorial analysis we study the error probability in wrongly terminating a reinforcement learning activity which undermines the effectiveness of an optimal policy, and we show that the resultant error can be quite high. Whilst we demonstrate mathematically that such errors can never be eliminated, we propose some practical mechanisms that can effectively reduce such errors. Simulation experiments have been carried out, the results of which are in close agreement with our theoretical findings.",0
"This paper presents a unified perspective on performance dynamics and termination errors in reinforcement learning (RL). RL algorithms have been successfully applied to many domains, but they can suffer from instability, slow convergence, and other issues that affect their effectiveness. To address these problems, we propose a framework that considers both the dynamic nature of RL algorithms and the properties of the environment in which they operate. We show how different sources of error and uncertainty can lead to suboptimal behavior and termination errors, and demonstrate techniques for identifying and mitigating these issues. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by RL algorithms and highlights potential solutions for improving their stability and efficiency. By providing insights into the root causes of termination errors and performance degradation, our work paves the way for more effective training strategies and improved application outcomes in real-world settings.",1
"In reinforcement learning episodes, the rewards and punishments are often non-deterministic, and there are invariably stochastic elements governing the underlying situation. Such stochastic elements are often numerous and cannot be known in advance, and they have a tendency to obscure the underlying rewards and punishments patterns. Indeed, if stochastic elements were absent, the same outcome would occur every time and the learning problems involved could be greatly simplified. In addition, in most practical situations, the cost of an observation to receive either a reward or punishment can be significant, and one would wish to arrive at the correct learning conclusion by incurring minimum cost. In this paper, we present a stochastic approach to reinforcement learning which explicitly models the variability present in the learning environment and the cost of observation. Criteria and rules for learning success are quantitatively analyzed, and probabilities of exceeding the observation cost bounds are also obtained.",0
"Title: ""Optimizing Policy Selection Using Proximal Optimal Policies"" Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), policy selection plays a critical role in determining an agent’s behavior. One approach to RL that has gained significant popularity over recent years is stochastic gradient descent using proximal updates (PGPE). However, existing approaches to selecting policies for PGPE have largely relied on heuristics or arbitrary rules. This work presents a new framework for optimally selecting policies in PGPE by leveraging proximal optimal policies. By defining a surrogate objective function based on proximal optimization, we can obtain provably convergent results for both batch and online policy selection. Experiments show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various domains including Atari games and continuous control tasks. Our framework allows researchers to use off-policy learning algorithms while enjoying the benefits of convergence guarantees, improving their ability to scale these methods to real-world problems.",1
"We study continuous action reinforcement learning problems in which it is crucial that the agent interacts with the environment only through safe policies, i.e.,~policies that do not take the agent to undesirable situations. We formulate these problems as constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) and present safe policy optimization algorithms that are based on a Lyapunov approach to solve them. Our algorithms can use any standard policy gradient (PG) method, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) or proximal policy optimization (PPO), to train a neural network policy, while guaranteeing near-constraint satisfaction for every policy update by projecting either the policy parameter or the action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by the state-dependent linearized Lyapunov constraints. Compared to the existing constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Moreover, our action-projection algorithm often leads to less conservative policy updates and allows for natural integration into an end-to-end PG training pipeline. We evaluate our algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art baselines on several simulated (MuJoCo) tasks, as well as a real-world indoor robot navigation problem, demonstrating their effectiveness in terms of balancing performance and constraint satisfaction.

"Machine learning can provide efficient solutions to the complex problems encountered in autonomous driving, but ensuring their safety remains a challenge. A number of authors have attempted to address this issue, but there are few publicly-available tools to adequately explore the trade-offs between functionality, scalability, and safety.   We thus present WiseMove, a software framework to investigate safe deep reinforcement learning in the context of motion planning for autonomous driving. WiseMove adopts a modular learning architecture that suits our current research questions and can be adapted to new technologies and new questions. We present the details of WiseMove, demonstrate its use on a common traffic scenario, and describe how we use it in our ongoing safe learning research.",0
"Title: ""Achieving Safer Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles""  Autonomous vehicles have gained significant attention recently due to their potential to revolutionize transportation and increase road safety. One promising approach for enabling autonomous driving is through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which allows agents to learn complex behaviors by interacting with an environment. Despite its successes, applying DRL to real-world applications like autonomous driving presents unique challenges that must be addressed before widespread adoption can occur. Chief among these concerns is ensuring safe and reliable behavior from trained models.  In this work, we present ""WiseMove,"" a comprehensive framework designed to address common issues associated with using DRL for autonomy. Our proposed solution consists of three main components: domain randomization, intrinsic motivations, and human feedback integration. By incorporating these elements into our training process, we aim to create more robust policies that generalize better to unseen situations while minimizing risky actions during deployment. We evaluate our method on two different domains -- a simulation based on Grand Theft Auto V and a physical testbed with robotic cars controlled via WiFi -- demonstrating improved performance across a range of metrics compared to standard RL approaches.  Overall, our research seeks to bridge the gap between the promise of DRL for autonomous systems and the reality of achieving safe behavior in the real world. With the increasing importance of deploying trustworthy autonomous technologies, frameworks such as WiseMove become essential tools for practitioners in the field. As further development progresses, our work serves as a foundation for future studies focused on refining DRL algorithms for safer and more reliable autonomous driving experiences.",1
"Deep neuroevolution and deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) algorithms are two popular approaches to policy search. The former is widely applicable and rather stable, but suffers from low sample efficiency. By contrast, the latter is more sample efficient, but the most sample efficient variants are also rather unstable and highly sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. So far, these families of methods have mostly been compared as competing tools. However, an emerging approach consists in combining them so as to get the best of both worlds. Two previously existing combinations use either an ad hoc evolutionary algorithm or a goal exploration process together with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a sample efficient off-policy deep RL algorithm. In this paper, we propose a different combination scheme using the simple cross-entropy method (CEM) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (td3), another off-policy deep RL algorithm which improves over ddpg. We evaluate the resulting method, cem-rl, on a set of benchmarks classically used in deep RL. We show that cem-rl benefits from several advantages over its competitors and offers a satisfactory trade-off between performance and sample efficiency.",0
"This work presents a new approach that combines evolutionary and gradient-based methods for policy search in reinforcement learning (RL).

The first module extracts a low-dimensional latent semantic representation of the image. The control module trained with reinforcement learning takes the latent vector as input to predict the correct steering angle. The experimental results have showed that our method is capable of learning to maneuver the car without any human control signals.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning provides a promising approach for vision-based control of real-world robots. However, the generalization of such models depends critically on the quantity and variety of data available for training. This data can be difficult to obtain for some types of robotic systems, such as fragile, small-scale quadrotors. Simulated rendering and physics can provide for much larger datasets, but such data is inherently of lower quality: many of the phenomena that make the real-world autonomous flight problem challenging, such as complex physics and air currents, are modeled poorly or not at all, and the systematic differences between simulation and the real world are typically impossible to eliminate. In this work, we investigate how data from both simulation and the real world can be combined in a hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Our method uses real-world data to learn about the dynamics of the system, and simulated data to learn a generalizable perception system that can enable the robot to avoid collisions using only a monocular camera. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world nano aerial vehicle collision avoidance task, showing that with only an hour of real-world data, the quadrotor can avoid collisions in new environments with various lighting conditions and geometry. Code, instructions for building the aerial vehicles, and videos of the experiments can be found at github.com/gkahn13/GtS",0
"In the context of aerial robots operating autonomously without a human pilot on board, vision plays an important role as one way to make sense of their surroundings. To learn the relevant control policies by trial and error requires simulation that captures realism, while collecting data from actual flights would be dangerous due to the potential damage a drone can cause if something goes wrong during learning. This study describes how to integrate simulated flight experiences together with real flight experience in a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, so that the agent learns more quickly and effectively, since both real flight experience and high quality simulated experience provide insight that complement each other but no single method alone could give equally well enough training signal to guarantee safe autonomous flight on demand anywhere a customer might wish to go. Although previous methods tried to generalize knowledge gained from either real or simulated flight experience to the opposite domain separately, we present an approach that uses real flight data to inform the parameters used to simulate the virtual environment. Through transfer learning, our algorithms leverages insights learned through real flight data to bootstrap better simulations. We prove analytically that these methods improve exploration efficiency and final performance compared to baseline models trained exclusively using either type of data. We validate the findings experimentally using two different types of quadrotor drones flying through challenging obstacle courses in simulation with synthetic sensor noise added as well as real world tests where safety observers monitor the experiments and manually intervene whenever they believe intervention is required. Our results show consistent improvement across all metrics collected. With implications beyond robotics, we intend this study as a step towards understanding how humans and artificial agents can cooperate most effectively at acquiring effective behaviors.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning has been shown to be very successful in complex games, e.g. Atari or Go. These games have clearly defined rules, and hence allow simulation. In many practical applications, however, interactions with the environment are costly and a good simulator of the environment is not available. Further, as environments differ by application, the optimal inductive bias (architecture, hyperparameters, etc.) of a reinforcement agent depends on the application. In this work, we propose a multi-arm bandit framework that selects from a set of different reinforcement learning agents to choose the one with the best inductive bias. To alleviate the problem of sparse rewards, the reinforcement learning agents are augmented with surrogate rewards. This helps the bandit framework to select the best agents early, since these rewards are smoother and less sparse than the environment reward. The bandit has the double objective of maximizing the reward while the agents are learning and selecting the best agent after a finite number of learning steps. Our experimental results on standard environments show that the proposed framework is able to consistently select the optimal agent after a finite number of steps, while collecting more cumulative reward compared to selecting a sub-optimal architecture or uniformly alternating between different agents.",0
"This would likely go at the beginning of your document after any acknowledgements, dedications, etc but before introduction. I am going to write the entire paper here and you can add the abstract if you want: Introduction: In this work we propose a new framework for selecting optimal agents in reinforcement learning tasks. We use an approach based on upper confidence bounds (UCB) to guide the selection process. Unlike previous methods which select the agent with the highest value function estimate at each time step, our method allows for more robust selection by choosing the agent whose action-value uncertainty most closely aligns with the optimality gap. Our theoretical results show that this choice leads to better regret bounds than existing methods in many cases. Experiments on several benchmark domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The source code for all experiments is available online.",1
"Despite many algorithmic advances, our theoretical understanding of practical distributional reinforcement learning methods remains limited. One exception is Rowland et al. (2018)'s analysis of the C51 algorithm in terms of the Cram\'er distance, but their results only apply to the tabular setting and ignore C51's use of a softmax to produce normalized distributions. In this paper we adapt the Cram\'er distance to deal with arbitrary vectors. From it we derive a new distributional algorithm which is fully Cram\'er-based and can be combined to linear function approximation, with formal guarantees in the context of policy evaluation. In allowing the model's prediction to be any real vector, we lose the probabilistic interpretation behind the method, but otherwise maintain the appealing properties of distributional approaches. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first proof of convergence of a distributional algorithm combined with function approximation. Perhaps surprisingly, our results provide evidence that Cram\'er-based distributional methods may perform worse than directly approximating the value function.",0
Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to many challenging sequential decision making problems but most RL algorithms assume that they can compute exact values everywhere in state space which is often impractical or impossible. Linear value function approximation methods approximate values at every point by a weighted sum of basis functions and have received recent attention due to their favorable theoretical guarantees and empirical performance. In distributional RL we focus on approximating the whole cumulative density function instead of just a scalar value allowing us to reason more precisely about uncertainty in both states and actions through measures such as expected value and entropy. In this work we apply linear function approximation methods to distributional RL showing that indeed linearity allows them to scale better than nonlinear alternatives like Gaussian processes while maintaining good theoretical guarantees from previous results. We provide experiments comparing these scalable distributional methods against prior works on classic control tasks demonstrating competitive performance on average while providing significantly lower variance over trials even when using function classes comparable to those used previously. These promising results make clear that there is still room to improve the scalability of RL algorithms even within the class of models amenable to theoretical analysis but without sacrificing their ability to perform well on real world applications. Furthermore these ideas could potentially lead beyond traditional model free RL algorithms to approaches that learn complex distributions directly with linear models over general function spaces opening up exciting opportunities throughout machine learning.,1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have traditionally been tasked with maximizing the value function of a Markov decision process (MDP), either in continuous settings, with fixed discount factor $\gamma  1$, or in episodic settings, with $\gamma = 1$. While this has proven effective for specific tasks with well-defined objectives (e.g., games), it has never been established that fixed discounting is suitable for general purpose use (e.g., as a model of human preferences). This paper characterizes rationality in sequential decision making using a set of seven axioms and arrives at a form of discounting that generalizes traditional fixed discounting. In particular, our framework admits a state-action dependent ""discount"" factor that is not constrained to be less than 1, so long as there is eventual long run discounting. Although this broadens the range of possible preference structures in continuous settings, we show that there exists a unique ""optimizing MDP"" with fixed $\gamma  1$ whose optimal value function matches the true utility of the optimal policy, and we quantify the difference between value and utility for suboptimal policies. Our work can be seen as providing a normative justification for (a slight generalization of) Martha White's RL task formalism (2017) and other recent departures from the traditional RL, and is relevant to task specification in RL, inverse RL and preference-based RL.",0
"""This paper presents a new approach to reinforcement learning that challenges traditional assumptions about discounting future rewards. Using decision theory as a framework, we argue that the standard exponential discount factor used in many models may be unnecessary and can lead to suboptimal policies. We propose an alternative method based on dynamic programming principles that allows for more flexible and realistic representation of temporal preferences. Through a series of simulations and case studies, we demonstrate how our method outperforms existing approaches in a variety of tasks, including resource allocation, planning under uncertainty, and multi-agent coordination.""",1
"Multi-step methods such as Retrace($\lambda$) and $n$-step $Q$-learning have become a crucial component of modern deep reinforcement learning agents. These methods are often evaluated as a part of bigger architectures and their evaluations rarely include enough samples to draw statistically significant conclusions about their performance. This type of methodology makes it difficult to understand how particular algorithmic details of multi-step methods influence learning. In this paper we combine the $n$-step action-value algorithms Retrace, $Q$-learning, Tree Backup, Sarsa, and $Q(\sigma)$ with an architecture analogous to DQN. We test the performance of all these algorithms in the mountain car environment; this choice of environment allows for faster training times and larger sample sizes. We present statistical analyses on the effects of the off-policy correction, the backup length parameter $n$, and the update frequency of the target network on the performance of these algorithms. Our results show that (1) using off-policy correction can have an adverse effect on the performance of Sarsa and $Q(\sigma)$; (2) increasing the backup length $n$ consistently improved performance across all the different algorithms; and (3) the performance of Sarsa and $Q$-learning was more robust to the effect of the target network update frequency than the performance of Tree Backup, $Q(\sigma)$, and Retrace in this particular task.",0
"In this study we investigate multi-step deep reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the use of different target networks in the Double Q-learning Network (DQN) algorithm. We conduct a systematic analysis of three types of target networks - the fixed decaying average, linearly increasing, and moving window - on six classic Atari games using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our results show that while all three target network variants achieve competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art RL algorithms, there are significant differences in their behaviors and characteristics across tasks. The choice of target network can significantly impact key aspects such as exploration strategies, training stability, and final policy quality. We provide comprehensive analysis and discussion of our findings, highlighting the strengths and tradeoffs of each target network variant under different conditions. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into the design choices involved in implementing effective multi-step deep RL systems, contributing to broader understanding of the field.",1
"Multi-armed bandit(MAB) problem is a reinforcement learning framework where an agent tries to maximise her profit by proper selection of actions through absolute feedback for each action. The dueling bandits problem is a variation of MAB problem in which an agent chooses a pair of actions and receives relative feedback for the chosen action pair. The dueling bandits problem is well suited for modelling a setting in which it is not possible to provide quantitative feedback for each action, but qualitative feedback for each action is preferred as in the case of human feedback. The dueling bandits have been successfully applied in applications such as online rank elicitation, information retrieval, search engine improvement and clinical online recommendation. We propose a new method called Sup-KLUCB for K-armed dueling bandit problem specifically Copeland bandit problem by converting it into a standard MAB problem. Instead of using MAB algorithm independently for each action in a pair as in Sparring and in Self-Sparring algorithms, we combine a pair of action and use it as one action. Previous UCB algorithms such as Relative Upper Confidence Bound(RUCB) can be applied only in case of Condorcet dueling bandits, whereas this algorithm applies to general Copeland dueling bandits, including Condorcet dueling bandits as a special case. Our empirical results outperform state of the art Double Thompson Sampling(DTS) in case of Copeland dueling bandits.",0
"In recent years, multiarmed bandit problems have received significant attention due to their wide range of applications, from online advertising and recommendation systems to medical trials and clinical decision making. One variant of these problems, known as Copeland bandits, is particularly important because it considers both exploitation and exploration aspects while optimizing cumulative rewards. This study presents a novel approach called Knowledge Lifetime Upper Confidence Bound (KLUCB) that extends the classical UCB algorithms to handle the challenges associated with solving Copeland bandit problems effectively. We show how our proposed method can achieve better regret bounds compared to several existing approaches. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that KLUCB achieves superior performance in terms of regret reduction without incurring higher computational complexity. Overall, our results suggest that KLUCB is an effective solution for coping with real-world scenarios where traditional methods may fall short. By leveraging insights from knowledge lifetimes and upper confidence bound techniques, we provide a more reliable and efficient framework for addressing Copeland bandit problems.",1
"Training intelligent agents through reinforcement learning is a notoriously unstable procedure. Massive parallelization on GPUs and distributed systems has been exploited to generate a large amount of training experiences and consequently reduce instabilities, but the success of training remains strongly influenced by the choice of the hyperparameters. To overcome this issue, we introduce HyperTrick, a new metaoptimization algorithm, and show its effective application to tune hyperparameters in the case of deep reinforcement learning, while learning to play different Atari games on a distributed system. Our analysis provides evidence of the interaction between the identification of the optimal hyperparameters and the learned policy, that is typical of the case of metaoptimization for deep reinforcement learning. When compared with state-of-the-art metaoptimization algorithms, HyperTrick is characterized by a simpler implementation and it allows learning similar policies, while making a more effective use of the computational resources in a distributed system.",0
"Optimizing machine learning algorithms can often involve tuning many hyperparameters that influence their performance. One common method used to achieve optimal results is metaoptimization, which involves optimizing over both hyperparameters and algorithm architectures. In recent years, distributed computing has become increasingly prevalent, allowing for the training of larger models on more data. However, distributed systems introduce new challenges such as communication overheads and straggler nodes that must be addressed. This paper presents an approach to performing metaoptimization on a distributed system using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By leveraging techniques such as model parallelism and asynchronous updates, we demonstrate how to effectively perform metaoptimization on a large-scale distributed system without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy. Our experiments show significant improvements over traditional centralized optimization methods, highlighting the potential benefits of incorporating DRL into future metaoptimization pipelines. Overall, our work provides a promising direction towards automated machine learning on distributed systems.",1
"Machine learning approaches hold great potential for the automated detection of lung nodules in chest radiographs, but training the algorithms requires vary large amounts of manually annotated images, which are difficult to obtain. Weak labels indicating whether a radiograph is likely to contain pulmonary nodules are typically easier to obtain at scale by parsing historical free-text radiological reports associated to the radiographs. Using a repositotory of over 700,000 chest radiographs, in this study we demonstrate that promising nodule detection performance can be achieved using weak labels through convolutional neural networks for radiograph classification. We propose two network architectures for the classification of images likely to contain pulmonary nodules using both weak labels and manually-delineated bounding boxes, when these are available. Annotated nodules are used at training time to deliver a visual attention mechanism informing the model about its localisation performance. The first architecture extracts saliency maps from high-level convolutional layers and compares the estimated position of a nodule against the ground truth, when this is available. A corresponding localisation error is then back-propagated along with the softmax classification error. The second approach consists of a recurrent attention model that learns to observe a short sequence of smaller image portions through reinforcement learning. When a nodule annotation is available at training time, the reward function is modified accordingly so that exploring portions of the radiographs away from a nodule incurs a larger penalty. Our empirical results demonstrate the potential advantages of these architectures in comparison to competing methodologies.",0
"Here we report on our recent work developing novel deep learning methods for the automatic detection of lung nodules in chest radiography images. Our approach leverages Visual Attention (VA) mechanisms to locate regions most likely to contain relevant features that can help identify nodules. We trained several models with different architectures, each based on convolutional neural networks pretrained on large datasets, such as ImageNet or JFT-300M. The resulting systems were then evaluated against three widely used public benchmark datasets: ChestXray8, ChexDB, and Indian Chest Radiograph Dataset (ICRD). Across all evaluations, we achieved state-of-the art results. In summary, by integrating VA modules into traditional computer vision pipeline, this research opens up new pathways towards building reliable CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) tools that could support radiologists and physicians in diagnosing lung cancer at earlier stages.

"In the NeurIPS 2018 Artificial Intelligence for Prosthetics challenge, participants were tasked with building a controller for a musculoskeletal model with a goal of matching a given time-varying velocity vector. Top participants were invited to describe their algorithms. In this work, we describe the challenge and present thirteen solutions that used deep reinforcement learning approaches. Many solutions use similar relaxations and heuristics, such as reward shaping, frame skipping, discretization of the action space, symmetry, and policy blending. However, each team implemented different modifications of the known algorithms by, for example, dividing the task into subtasks, learning low-level control, or by incorporating expert knowledge and using imitation learning.",0

"In this paper, we present a new class of Markov decision processes (MDPs), called Tsallis MDPs, with Tsallis entropy maximization, which generalizes existing maximum entropy reinforcement learning (RL). A Tsallis MDP provides a unified framework for the original RL problem and RL with various types of entropy, including the well-known standard Shannon-Gibbs (SG) entropy, using an additional real-valued parameter, called an entropic index. By controlling the entropic index, we can generate various types of entropy, including the SG entropy, and a different entropy results in a different class of the optimal policy in Tsallis MDPs. We also provide a full mathematical analysis of Tsallis MDPs, including the optimality condition, performance error bounds, and convergence. Our theoretical result enables us to use any positive entropic index in RL. To handle complex and large-scale problems, we propose a model-free actor-critic RL method using Tsallis entropy maximization. We evaluate the regularization effect of the Tsallis entropy with various values of entropic indices and show that the entropic index controls the exploration tendency of the proposed method. For a different type of RL problems, we find that a different value of the entropic index is desirable. The proposed method is evaluated using the MuJoCo simulator and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",0
"Here we present ""Tsallis Reinforcement Learning"", which is a new framework that unifies maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL) and traditional reinforcement learning (RL). The goal of MERL is to maximize the entropy rate while achieving a desired level of task performance, making it well suited for applications where exploration is important. However, existing methods suffer from poor sample efficiency due to their reliance on gradient estimation techniques. In contrast, RL algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art performance by directly optimizing expected rewards, but cannot directly maximize entropy production due to negative cumulant constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we propose using the Tsallis entropy as a bridge between these two types of objective functions. This allows us to reformulate MERL problems as constrained optimization problems under a single umbrella framework based on standard deep RL algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Trust Region policy optimization (TRPO), Soft actor critic (SAC), or DDPG. We show through comprehensive experiments across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks that our method outperforms prior work by significantly improving both task success rates and robustness, while still satisfying the necessary constraints from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned policies exhibit markedly different behavior than those produced by traditional RL methods, showing that they indeed learn to explore and exploit more effectively according to measures of nonlinear predictability. Our results indicate that Tsallis RL is effective at promoting both task competency and novelty search in complex high-dimensional action spaces.  This paper contributes to our understanding of RL algorithms by developing a general framework that integrates previously disparate approaches into a coherent whole. By introducing additional theoretical guarantees associated with nonequilibrium statistical mechani",1
"This paper provides an analysis of the tradeoff between asymptotic bias (suboptimality with unlimited data) and overfitting (additional suboptimality due to limited data) in the context of reinforcement learning with partial observability. Our theoretical analysis formally characterizes that while potentially increasing the asymptotic bias, a smaller state representation decreases the risk of overfitting. This analysis relies on expressing the quality of a state representation by bounding L1 error terms of the associated belief states. Theoretical results are empirically illustrated when the state representation is a truncated history of observations, both on synthetic POMDPs and on a large-scale POMDP in the context of smartgrids, with real-world data. Finally, similarly to known results in the fully observable setting, we also briefly discuss and empirically illustrate how using function approximators and adapting the discount factor may enhance the tradeoff between asymptotic bias and overfitting in the partially observable context.",0
"In this work, we consider the problem of batch reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments where both the agent and the environment interact for multiple steps before receiving feedback on the quality of each action sequence. We show that even simple RL algorithms can suffer from overfitting due to their sensitivity to noise in the observed trajectories, resulting in poor generalization performance. Moreover, we demonstrate how traditional asymptotic convergence results may fail to hold in practice, leading to uncontrolled biases accumulated during training. Our analysis provides new insights into the factors contributing to these problems, suggesting remedies such as incorporating more randomness in the algorithm design or using conservative policies as initialization points. Ultimately, our findings highlight the need to carefully evaluate algorithmic behavior in complex environments to ensure reliable performance under real-world conditions.",1
"The transfer of knowledge from one policy to another is an important tool in Deep Reinforcement Learning. This process, referred to as distillation, has been used to great success, for example, by enhancing the optimisation of agents, leading to stronger performance faster, on harder domains [26, 32, 5, 8]. Despite the widespread use and conceptual simplicity of distillation, many different formulations are used in practice, and the subtle variations between them can often drastically change the performance and the resulting objective that is being optimised. In this work, we rigorously explore the entire landscape of policy distillation, comparing the motivations and strengths of each variant through theoretical and empirical analysis. Our results point to three distillation techniques, that are preferred depending on specifics of the task. Specifically a newly proposed expected entropy regularised distillation allows for quicker learning in a wide range of situations, while still guaranteeing convergence.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable progress in training agents that can perform complex tasks across multiple domains. However, one major challenge in using DRL lies in obtaining samples efficiently from interactions with environments. This issue becomes more pronounced as we move towards real-world applications where collecting millions of interaction samples may not always be feasible. Therefore, there arises a need to find alternatives to directly interacting with real world systems by utilizing already available simulation data, datasets obtained via human demonstrations or data transfer methods.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been around for decades and employed to solve various sequential decision-making problems. These algorithms however have faced great challenges when dealing with high-dimensional environments. The recent development of deep learning has enabled RL methods to drive optimal policies for sophisticated and capable agents, which can perform efficiently in these challenging environments. This paper addresses an important aspect of deep RL related to situations that require multiple agents to communicate and cooperate to solve complex tasks. A survey of different approaches to problems related to multi-agent deep RL (MADRL) is presented, including non-stationarity, partial observability, continuous state and action spaces, multi-agent training schemes, multi-agent transfer learning. The merits and demerits of the reviewed methods will be analyzed and discussed, with their corresponding applications explored. It is envisaged that this review provides insights about various MADRL methods and can lead to future development of more robust and highly useful multi-agent learning methods for solving real-world problems.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training artificial agents to perform complex tasks in multi-agent systems. DRL algorithms utilize neural networks to learn optimal policies by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. However, applying DRL to multi-agent settings presents unique challenges due to the presence of multiple decision-makers whose actions can impact one another. This review outlines some of these challenges and surveys several state-of-the-art solutions that have been proposed to address them. We discuss both centralized and decentralized approaches to multi-agent DRL, as well as methods for tackling issues such as credit assignment, policy invariance, and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. Finally, we explore several real-world applications where DRL has been used successfully in multi-agent scenarios, including games, autonomous driving, and distributed control systems. By providing a comprehensive overview of current research trends and future directions, this review aims to inspire further progress in developing robust and efficient DRL algorithms for multi-agent environments.",1
"Despite the notable successes in video games such as Atari 2600, current AI is yet to defeat human champions in the domain of real-time strategy (RTS) games. One of the reasons is that an RTS game is a multi-agent game, in which single-agent reinforcement learning methods cannot simply be applied because the environment is not a stationary Markov Decision Process. In this paper, we present a first step toward finding a game-theoretic solution to RTS games by applying Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP), a game-theoretic approach for finding Nash equilibria, to Mini-RTS, a small but nontrivial RTS game provided on the ELF platform. More specifically, we show that NFSP can be effectively combined with policy gradient reinforcement learning and be applied to Mini-RTS. Experimental results also show that the scalability of NFSP can be substantially improved by pretraining the models with simple self-play using policy gradients, which by itself gives a strong strategy despite its lack of theoretical guarantee of convergence.",0
"This paper presents a neural fictitious self-play agent designed to play games like elf mini rts where players compete over resources and create buildings that provide unique abilities. After evaluating state-of-the-art methods, we implemented a novel multi-agent policy learning approach leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning in deep RNN networks which enabled our system to achieve top performances across multiple environments including both random maps and fixed-built maps. Our model also significantly outperformed all previously published results according to evaluation metrics such as normalized score difference and win rates. We believe this new method has broader implications beyond just ELF Mini-RTS and could improve game playing strategies across different domains by optimizing resource allocation decisions.",1
"Backpropagation and the chain rule of derivatives have been prominent; however, the total derivative rule has not enjoyed the same amount of attention. In this work we show how the total derivative rule leads to an intuitive visual framework for creating gradient estimators on graphical models. In particular, previous ""policy gradient theorems"" are easily derived. We derive new gradient estimators based on density estimation, as well as a likelihood ratio gradient, which ""jumps"" to an intermediate node, not directly to the objective function. We evaluate our methods on model-based policy gradient algorithms, achieve good performance, and present evidence towards demystifying the success of the popular PILCO algorithm.",0
"In recent years, total stochastic gradient (TSG) methods have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex optimization problems in machine learning and beyond.

We first introduce the key concepts behind TSG methods and explain how they differ from traditional gradient descent approaches. We then present several state-of-the-art TSG algorithms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of TSG techniques in two real-world case studies: optimizing deep neural networks for image classification and tuning policy parameters in reinforcement learning tasks. Our results demonstrate that TSG methods offer significant improvements over existing approaches and hold great promise for future research in these areas. Overall, this paper contributes to the growing body of literature on TSG methods by providing a comprehensive overview of current developments and highlighting new directions for future work.",1
"Uplift modeling aims to directly model the incremental impact of a treatment on an individual response. In this work, we address the problem from a new angle and reformulate it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We conducted extensive experiments on both a synthetic dataset and real-world scenarios, and showed that our method can achieve significant improvement over previous methods.",0
"Here's an example:  Uplift modeling involves predictive analytics that aim to improve upon traditional response models by identifying interventions that influence individuals who would not respond otherwise. In recent years, uplift modeling has gained significant attention due to its ability to provide more accurate predictions, better target marketing campaigns, and increased customer satisfaction. However, implementing successful uplift models remains challenging due to the complexity involved in capturing both positive and negative responses. This study proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to address these issues. By leveraging RL algorithms, we can overcome some of the limitations associated with existing methods while maximizing the impact of our efforts. Our experiments demonstrate promising results in terms of improved accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional approaches. We believe that this work offers valuable insights into the potential benefits of applying RL to uplift modeling problems and contributes to the growing literature on this topic.",1
"Recent efforts on training visual navigation agents conditioned on language using deep reinforcement learning have been successful in learning policies for different multimodal tasks, such as semantic goal navigation and embodied question answering. In this paper, we propose a multitask model capable of jointly learning these multimodal tasks, and transferring knowledge of words and their grounding in visual objects across the tasks. The proposed model uses a novel Dual-Attention unit to disentangle the knowledge of words in the textual representations and visual concepts in the visual representations, and align them with each other. This disentangled task-invariant alignment of representations facilitates grounding and knowledge transfer across both tasks. We show that the proposed model outperforms a range of baselines on both tasks in simulated 3D environments. We also show that this disentanglement of representations makes our model modular, interpretable, and allows for transfer to instructions containing new words by leveraging object detectors.",0
"Embodied multimodal multitask learning is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to improve artificial intelligence by enabling systems to learn from multiple sources of data and develop robust representations of complex tasks.

By doing so, embodied multimodal models can better capture contextual dependencies between different types of sensor inputs. In addition, these models have been shown to perform well across a range of challenging benchmarks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics domains. Despite their successes, however, there remain several open questions related to how these approaches should be designed, implemented, and evaluated. We explore some of these issues and discuss potential future directions for research in this area.

"We introduce Dynamic Planning Networks (DPN), a novel architecture for deep reinforcement learning, that combines model-based and model-free aspects for online planning. Our architecture learns to dynamically construct plans using a learned state-transition model by selecting and traversing between simulated states and actions to maximize information before acting. In contrast to model-free methods, model-based planning lets the agent efficiently test action hypotheses without performing costly trial-and-error in the environment. DPN learns to efficiently form plans by expanding a single action-conditional state transition at a time instead of exhaustively evaluating each action, reducing the required number of state-transitions during planning by up to 96%. We observe various emergent planning patterns used to solve environments, including classical search methods such as breadth-first and depth-first search. DPN shows improved data efficiency, performance, and generalization to new and unseen domains in comparison to several baselines.",0
"Title: Dynamic Planning Networks Abstract: Successful human planning involves balancing deliberation against real-time decision making, adapting plans as circumstances change, and leveraging knowledge accumulated over time. Inspired by these abilities, we propose dynamic planning networks (DPNs), which model complex problems while enabling efficient and flexible execution. We present a DPN architecture that learns to generate and transition between high-level action sequences, predict expected rewards based on environmental feedback, evaluate alternative plans under uncertainty using Monte Carlo search, and iteratively improve plan quality. Evaluations across multiple domains show that DPNs significantly outperform state-of-the-art planners in speed and accuracy, illustrating their effectiveness for solving complex sequential decision tasks. Our findings support the value of integrating both deliberative and fast learning components within artificial intelligence systems, enhancing their ability to handle rapidly changing environments.",1
"Previously, the exploding gradient problem has been explained to be central in deep learning and model-based reinforcement learning, because it causes numerical issues and instability in optimization. Our experiments in model-based reinforcement learning imply that the problem is not just a numerical issue, but it may be caused by a fundamental chaos-like nature of long chains of nonlinear computations. Not only do the magnitudes of the gradients become large, the direction of the gradients becomes essentially random. We show that reparameterization gradients suffer from the problem, while likelihood ratio gradients are robust. Using our insights, we develop a model-based policy search framework, Probabilistic Inference for Particle-Based Policy Search (PIPPS), which is easily extensible, and allows for almost arbitrary models and policies, while simultaneously matching the performance of previous data-efficient learning algorithms. Finally, we invent the total propagation algorithm, which efficiently computes a union over all pathwise derivative depths during a single backwards pass, automatically giving greater weight to estimators with lower variance, sometimes improving over reparameterization gradients by $10^6$ times.",0
"In recent years, model-based policy search methods have emerged as effective tools for solving complex control problems. These methods use predictive models to guide exploration and learn policies that optimize desired objectives. However, these methods can suffer from two major issues: they require accurate models, which can be difficult to obtain or update; and their performance can degrade rapidly when faced with even small changes in the environment, known as the curse of chaos. To address these challenges, we introduce PIPPS (Probabilistic Integration of Predictions with Planning), a flexible model-based policy search algorithm robust to the curse of chaos. PIPPS uses probabilistically integrated predictions and adapts its planning based on the predictive uncertainty. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that PIPPS outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms across diverse control tasks, achieving high success rates while maintaining low computational cost. This work demonstrates the potential of using probabilistic integration techniques in policy search, paving the way for more reliable and efficient decision making under uncertainty.",1
"The effectiveness of model-based versus model-free methods is a long-standing question in reinforcement learning (RL). Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension. For policy evaluation, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances. Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing commonly used baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based and model-free methods on a continuous control task.",0
"This paper presents an asymptotic analysis of model-based and model-free methods used in linear quadratic regulation (LQR). Specifically, we compare two types of control laws; a state feedback controller based on a Lyapunov function, which belongs to the class of model-based controllers, and a feedback controller that relies only on data collected from system trajectories without knowledge of any dynamics models, known as model-free approaches. Our results show that under certain conditions on the system matrices, there exists a gap between these two classes of controllers in terms of their ability to stabilize the system. By analyzing the optimal cost functions associated with each type of controller, we demonstrate that the performance difference between them can become significant in large dimensions or in situations where precise parameter estimation is difficult. These findings have important implications for applications such as autonomous systems, robotics, and power networks, where LQR-type regulators are commonly employed. Overall, our work highlights the need for further research into understanding the strengths and limitations of different control methodologies and how they interact with various system characteristics.",1
"StarCraft II poses a grand challenge for reinforcement learning. The main difficulties of it include huge state and action space and a long-time horizon. In this paper, we investigate a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for StarCraft II. The hierarchy involves two levels of abstraction. One is the macro-action automatically extracted from expert's trajectories, which reduces the action space in an order of magnitude yet remains effective. The other is a two-layer hierarchical architecture which is modular and easy to scale, enabling a curriculum transferring from simpler tasks to more complex tasks. The reinforcement training algorithm for this architecture is also investigated. On a 64x64 map and using restrictive units, we achieve a winning rate of more than 99\% against the difficulty level-1 built-in AI. Through the curriculum transfer learning algorithm and a mixture of combat model, we can achieve over 93\% winning rate of Protoss against the most difficult non-cheating built-in AI (level-7) of Terran, training within two days using a single machine with only 48 CPU cores and 8 K40 GPUs. It also shows strong generalization performance, when tested against never seen opponents including cheating levels built-in AI and all levels of Zerg and Protoss built-in AI. We hope this study could shed some light on the future research of large-scale reinforcement learning.",0
"This work investigates the potential applications and limitations of reinforcement learning (RL) in solving complex sequential decision making problems by examining one such problem: playing full-length games of StarCraft. RL algorithms have been successful at simple games like Go and Chess but their performance decreases as the complexity increases. Therefore, exploring whether these models can achieve human level performance on more difficult tasks like StarCraft may provide valuable insights into the current state of RL research and guide future developments. Our results show that while current state-of-the-art RL techniques fail at playing full-length game, they perform well at certain subtasks, indicating that there might exist simpler problems within the game where RL is competent. Furthermore, we discuss possible reasons why RL models struggle with StarCraft compared to humans, including factors related to memory capacity, planning ahead, and learning strategies. In conclusion, our findings suggest that understanding how humans solve complex sequential decision making problems could lead to new approaches in developing intelligent agents capable of performing similar tasks effectively.",1
"We introduce Implicit Policy, a general class of expressive policies that can flexibly represent complex action distributions in reinforcement learning, with efficient algorithms to compute entropy regularized policy gradients.

"In recent years, there has been significant interest in using deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve complex control problems. However, applying these techniques can often require large amounts of data and computational resources. In response, researchers have developed several ways of improving the efficiency of RL algorithms by using prior knowledge about the problem domain. One such approach involves pretraining an agent on an auxiliary task that captures important aspects of the behavior required to succeed at the main task. This method is known as ""implicit policy search."" In this paper, we discuss how implicit policy search can be used to improve the performance of deep RL agents in high-dimensional continuous state spaces. We provide theoretical analysis that demonstrates the potential benefits of this technique and illustrate its effectiveness through simulations and experiments on challenging benchmark tasks from the literature. Our results show that explicit use of prior knowledge can substantially reduce the amount of interaction required to achieve good performance in hard exploration domains.",1
In this paper we consider the problem of how a reinforcement learning agent that is tasked with solving a sequence of reinforcement learning problems (a sequence of Markov decision processes) can use knowledge acquired early in its lifetime to improve its ability to solve new problems. We argue that previous experience with similar problems can provide an agent with information about how it should explore when facing a new but related problem. We show that the search for an optimal exploration strategy can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem itself and demonstrate that such strategy can leverage patterns found in the structure of related problems. We conclude with experiments that show the benefits of optimizing an exploration strategy using our proposed approach.,0
"In recent years there has been significant progress in developing algorithms that can achieve high levels of performance on challenging sequential decision making problems through model based deep reinforcement learning (MBRL). One key component of successful MBRL algorithms is exploration, as these methods often rely on interacting with the environment to construct accurate models which guide their actions. However, current approaches suffer from two fundamental drawbacks: they either focus exclusively on immediate rewards without considering more global measures such as cumulative regret, or they lack explicit modularity leading to overcomplicated solutions. In this work we aim to address both issues by proposing a meta-model predictive control (meta-MPC) approach that learns across tasks while considering both immediate reward maximization and cumulative regret minimization. Our method utilizes recent advances in natural policy gradient training to efficiently learn and balance both objectives simultaneously, allowing the agent to quickly adapt to new environments. We evaluate our algorithm against several baselines in multiple continuous control domains, demonstrating improved overall performance compared to prior state of the art approaches. Additionally we provide ablation studies and analysis highlighting important design choices made throughout development. Overall, our results suggest that a meta-MPC framework is highly effective at balancing exploration vs exploitation while maintaining strong generalization capabilities.",1
"In this work we explore a new approach for robots to teach themselves about the world simply by observing it. In particular we investigate the effectiveness of learning task-agnostic representations for continuous control tasks. We extend Time-Contrastive Networks (TCN) that learn from visual observations by embedding multiple frames jointly in the embedding space as opposed to a single frame. We show that by doing so, we are now able to encode both position and velocity attributes significantly more accurately. We test the usefulness of this self-supervised approach in a reinforcement learning setting. We show that the representations learned by agents observing themselves take random actions, or other agents perform tasks successfully, can enable the learning of continuous control policies using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using only the learned embeddings as input. We also demonstrate significant improvements on the real-world Pouring dataset with a relative error reduction of 39.4% for motion attributes and 11.1% for static attributes compared to the single-frame baseline.

"Effective reinforcement learning algorithms require an action representation that allows stable gradient computation even under large policy changes. While early methods like advantage actorcritic (A2C) have achieved impressive results on simple Atari tasks, scaling these up to more complex environments has been challenging due to the high variance of individual policy updates. One promising solution to address this challenge is model-free deep reinforcement learning (MFDL), which learns continuous actions directly without requiring an explicit state representation. However, most MFDL implementations still rely on the sampled pseudo-gradient estimator of Williams et al., which can lead to unstable convergence especially in multiagent settings where the agent’s policy is correlated with other agents. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn actionable representations through the use of intrinsic motivation mechanisms such as curiositydriven exploration bonuses to encourage effective behavior diversification among multiple agents. Our method introduces three main contributions: First, we introduce a novel regularization technique called policy stability training, which encourages policies with small norm change after one iteration update, leading to substantially reduced variance compared to previous stateofart models. Second, we present an efficient implementation utilizing modern automatic differentiation frameworks while maintaining stability guarantees, which drastically reduces computational overhead over previous work by OrnsteinUhlenbeck noise clipping. Finally, our approach obtains comparable performance to several benchmark methods across a variety of continuous control tasks while demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter tuning, showing significant benefits over related prior artsuchas VMPOandSACinmultiagentsettingswithlargeactionspaces.

"This paper presents a novel Subject-dependent Deep Aging Path (SDAP), which inherits the merits of both Generative Probabilistic Modeling and Inverse Reinforcement Learning to model the facial structures and the longitudinal face aging process of a given subject. The proposed SDAP is optimized using tractable log-likelihood objective functions with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based deep feature extraction. Instead of applying a fixed aging development path for all input faces and subjects, SDAP is able to provide the most appropriate aging development path for individual subject that optimizes the reward aging formulation. Unlike previous methods that can take only one image as the input, SDAP further allows multiple images as inputs, i.e. all information of a subject at either the same or different ages, to produce the optimal aging path for the given subject. Finally, SDAP allows efficiently synthesizing in-the-wild aging faces. The proposed model is experimented in both tasks of face aging synthesis and cross-age face verification. The experimental results consistently show SDAP achieves the state-of-the-art performance on numerous face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, MORPH, AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW), and Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD). Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of SDAP on large-scale Megaface challenge to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed solution.",0
"This paper presents a new method for learning from longitudinal face demonstrations using deep neural networks. We combine tractable modeling techniques with inverse reinforcement learning algorithms to develop a system that can learn complex tasks by observing human demonstrations over time. Our approach allows us to leverage both the strengths of deep models and the efficiency of IRL methods, enabling effective learning even with limited amounts of data. We evaluate our approach on a challenging benchmark task and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and generalization ability compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work shows that integrating these two types of approaches has significant potential to improve performance in robotics and other domains where imitation learning is used.",1
"Interactive Machine Learning is concerned with creating systems that operate in environments alongside humans to achieve a task. A typical use is to extend or amplify the capabilities of a human in cognitive or physical ways, requiring the machine to adapt to the users' intentions and preferences. Often, this takes the form of a human operator providing some type of feedback to the user, which can be explicit feedback, implicit feedback, or a combination of both. Explicit feedback, such as through a mouse click, carries a high cognitive load. The focus of this study is to extend the current state of the art in interactive machine learning by demonstrating that agents can learn a human user's behavior and adapt to preferences with a reduced amount of explicit human feedback in a mixed feedback setting. The learning agent perceives a value of its own behavior from hand gestures given via a spatial interface. This feedback mechanism is termed Spatial Interface Valuing. This method is evaluated experimentally in a simulated environment for a grasping task using a robotic arm with variable grip settings. Preliminary results indicate that learning agents using spatial interface valuing can learn a value function mapping spatial gestures to expected future rewards much more quickly as compared to those same agents just receiving explicit feedback, demonstrating that an agent perceiving feedback from a human user via a spatial interface can serve as an effective complement to existing approaches.",0
"In our study, we propose a novel approach to learn user preferences through reinforcement learning with spatial interface valuing (Spatial IV). This method combines the power of interactive graphical interfaces with the rich modeling capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms. We aim to demonstrate that by utilizing Spatial IV, we can accurately predict user preferences and generate personalized recommendations based on their behavioral patterns. Our results show promising improvements over traditional methods, highlighting the potential impact of using visual feedback to enhance user experience and satisfaction. By integrating human insights into machine learning models, our framework bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and human intuition. Overall, our findings contribute to a new frontier in user preference modeling, paving the way for more effective decision making across diverse application domains.",1
"Multiple automakers have in development or in production automated driving systems (ADS) that offer freeway-pilot functions. This type of ADS is typically limited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual to automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed manually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives (e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the merging vehicle optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem, we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow conditions.",0
"This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning architecture designed specifically for autonomous driving task: on-ramp merge. With the increasing interest in self-driving cars, there has been significant research focus on improving their capabilities in various scenarios such as merging into traffic from an on-ramp. We propose a hybrid model that combines deep Q-network (DQN) with value iteration network (VIN). In order to increase sample efficiency during training, we use experience replay and batch normalization. Our approach utilizes raw sensor input, including camera images and LIDAR pointclouds, which makes our model more generalizable to real world settings. Extensive simulations were conducted in CARLA, an open source simulator, where we compared our method against other state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that our hybrid model outperforms these methods by achieving higher success rates while maintaining lower minimum gap distance and collision rate. Our work demonstrates the potential for deep reinforcement learning models to improve performance in complex tasks such as merging onto highways. Overall, our framework provides insights towards developing safe and reliable autonomous vehicles capable of handling challenging on-ramp merge situations.",1
"Due to the capability of deep learning to perform well in high dimensional problems, deep reinforcement learning agents perform well in challenging tasks such as Atari 2600 games. However, clearly explaining why a certain action is taken by the agent can be as important as the decision itself. Deep reinforcement learning models, as other deep learning models, tend to be opaque in their decision-making process. In this work, we propose to make deep reinforcement learning more transparent by visualizing the evidence on which the agent bases its decision. In this work, we emphasize the importance of producing a justification for an observed action, which could be applied to a black-box decision agent.",0
"Here is an example of how I would write an abstract:  For decades, scientists have been fascinated by the mysteries of the deep sea. Only recently, however, has advanced technology allowed us to explore these depths like never before. In this study, we sought to uncover new insights into the hidden world beneath the waves by conducting a comprehensive analysis of deep-sea creatures using cutting-edge imaging techniques. Our results were nothing short of remarkable; we discovered previously unknown species, documented never-before-seen behaviors, and even made groundbreaking connections between seemingly disparate organisms. These findings not only expand our understanding of ocean ecosystems but may one day lead to critical advances in fields ranging from medicine to environmental science. With each passing year, we grow closer to solving the deep-rooted secrets that lie within Earth’s final frontier—the mysterious and awe-inspiring deep sea.",1
"We describe TF-Replicator, a framework for distributed machine learning designed for DeepMind researchers and implemented as an abstraction over TensorFlow. TF-Replicator simplifies writing data-parallel and model-parallel research code. The same models can be effortlessly deployed to different cluster architectures (i.e. one or many machines containing CPUs, GPUs or TPU accelerators) using synchronous or asynchronous training regimes. To demonstrate the generality and scalability of TF-Replicator, we implement and benchmark three very different models: (1) A ResNet-50 for ImageNet classification, (2) a SN-GAN for class-conditional ImageNet image generation, and (3) a D4PG reinforcement learning agent for continuous control. Our results show strong scalability performance without demanding any distributed systems expertise of the user. The TF-Replicator programming model will be open-sourced as part of TensorFlow 2.0 (see https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/25).",0
"In this work we introduce ""TF-Replicator"", a distributed machine learning system designed specifically to meet the needs and workflows of research scientists across different domains. Our primary goal was to provide ease-of-use without sacrificing expressiveness or functionality required by experienced practitioners of machine learning. To achieve these goals while maintaining portability, scalability, and compatibility with existing tools from the Python data ecosystem, we built TF-Replicator on top of Apache Spark and PyTorch, two well established systems that have demonstrated success in their respective roles as large scale batch processing engines and flexible deep neural network training frameworks. We demonstrate how our tool improves upon the state-of-the art in reproducibility via efficient management of codebook entries; distributed storage through Hadoop compatible file systems; improved performance in managing distributed computing resources and job scheduling; better user experience via interactive visualization during model building processes; and easy-to-use APIs based on popular libraries such as scikit-learn, Seaborn, Bokeh, etc., which make adoption easy and natural even for users who may not already be familiar with modern software development practices using version control systems like Git. As examples of use cases where TF-Replicator provides distinct advantages over current solutions, we discuss genomic analysis pipelines utilized within biotech companies and research institutions as well as fraud detection at internet service providers. These applications represent only some of the vast array potential opportunities enabled by providing powerful yet easy-to-use analytical and predictive capabilities directly into hands of end-users rather than limiting them exclusively to experts trained to wrangle complicated stacks of specialize dtools.",1
"In dynamic environments, learned controllers are supposed to take motion into account when selecting the action to be taken. However, in existing reinforcement learning works motion is rarely treated explicitly; it is rather assumed that the controller learns the necessary motion representation from temporal stacks of frames implicitly. In this paper, we show that for continuous control tasks learning an explicit representation of motion improves the quality of the learned controller in dynamic scenarios. We demonstrate this on common benchmark tasks (Walker, Swimmer, Hopper), on target reaching and ball catching tasks with simulated robotic arms, and on a dynamic single ball juggling task. Moreover, we find that when equipped with an appropriate network architecture, the agent can, on some tasks, learn motion features also with pure reinforcement learning, without additional supervision. Further we find that using an image difference between the current and the previous frame as an additional input leads to better results than a temporal stack of frames.",0
"This paper investigates how agents can perceive motion patterns from dynamic objects in their environment and learn to interact effectively within such environments by utilizing reinforcement learning techniques. By studying the relationship between visual input and movement patterns, we aim to create more robust artificial intelligence systems that can adapt to changing situations and make better decisions based on real-time information. Our research focuses on developing algorithms that allow agents to interpret movements in complex scenes involving multiple objects moving simultaneously, and then use this knowledge to improve decision making during interaction. We present experimental results showing the effectiveness of our approach in several challenging scenarios where traditional methods struggle due to high levels of uncertainty and complexity. Overall, our work represents a step forward in enabling intelligent agents to interact with dynamic environments using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.",1
"Many reinforcement learning applications involve the use of data that is sensitive, such as medical records of patients or financial information. However, most current reinforcement learning methods can leak information contained within the (possibly sensitive) data on which they are trained. To address this problem, we present the first differentially private approach for off-policy evaluation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the privacy-preserving properties of our algorithm and analyze its utility (speed of convergence). After describing some results of this theoretical analysis, we show empirically that our method outperforms previous methods (which are restricted to the on-policy setting).",0
"In recent years, off-policy evaluation (OPE) has emerged as an important tool for measuring the quality of reinforcement learning algorithms without requiring on-policy data collection. However, existing OPE methods often rely on access to the full history of policy rollouts, which can pose privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance. This paper presents a new approach to privacy preserving OPE that allows for accurate estimates while minimizing disclosure of confidential information. We demonstrate through experiments using real-world datasets that our method effectively balances privacy and accuracy, making it well-suited for use in sensitive applications where protecting user data is paramount. Our work contributes to the broader discussion surrounding ethical considerations in artificial intelligence and highlights the need for more research into privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning.",1
"Black-box optimizers that explore in parameter space have often been shown to outperform more sophisticated action space exploration methods developed specifically for the reinforcement learning problem. We examine these black-box methods closely to identify situations in which they are worse than action space exploration methods and those in which they are superior. Through simple theoretical analyses, we prove that complexity of exploration in parameter space depends on the dimensionality of parameter space, while complexity of exploration in action space depends on both the dimensionality of action space and horizon length. This is also demonstrated empirically by comparing simple exploration methods on several model problems, including Contextual Bandit, Linear Regression and Reinforcement Learning in continuous control.",0
"This paper presents a new perspective on contrasting exploration in parameter and action space by applying zeroth-order optimization techniques. We show that these methods can effectively balance the tradeoff between exploiting current knowledge and expanding our search to discover better solutions. Our approach builds upon recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning but offers distinct advantages over alternative strategies. Through extensive simulation experiments using benchmark tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in finding high-quality solutions faster than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings suggest that zeroth-order optimization provides a promising direction for efficient exploration in both continuous and discrete action spaces, paving the way for further research into improving sample efficiency and enhancing the performance of real-world applications in complex environments.",1
"The ability to transfer skills across tasks has the potential to scale up reinforcement learning (RL) agents to environments currently out of reach. Recently, a framework based on two ideas, successor features (SFs) and generalised policy improvement (GPI), has been introduced as a principled way of transferring skills. In this paper we extend the SFs & GPI framework in two ways. One of the basic assumptions underlying the original formulation of SFs & GPI is that rewards for all tasks of interest can be computed as linear combinations of a fixed set of features. We relax this constraint and show that the theoretical guarantees supporting the framework can be extended to any set of tasks that only differ in the reward function. Our second contribution is to show that one can use the reward functions themselves as features for future tasks, without any loss of expressiveness, thus removing the need to specify a set of features beforehand. This makes it possible to combine SFs & GPI with deep learning in a more stable way. We empirically verify this claim on a complex 3D environment where observations are images from a first-person perspective. We show that the transfer promoted by SFs & GPI leads to very good policies on unseen tasks almost instantaneously. We also describe how to learn policies specialised to the new tasks in a way that allows them to be added to the agent's set of skills, and thus be reused in the future.",0
"Increasingly larger state spaces have become one of the limiting factors in scaling up deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as deep Q network (DQN). One popular approach used to mitigate these issues is using successor features (SFs), which have been shown to increase sample efficiency and outperform DQN on several benchmark domains by training agents directly from pixels. This work explores how DQL can leverage SFs to improve generalisation and enable efficient fine tuning even at very small neural net sizes that would otherwise fail to learn even random policies without explicit modelling of memory dependencies between states via recurrent units or other mechanisms. Our contribution focuses on applying transfer methods derived from DQN and refining them further for use within DQL while removing the requirement for explicit target networks that were necessary due to compounding error within the earlier algorithm but no longer required once SFs have already reduced the effectiveness of errors accumulated during training on previous iterations. By enabling agents to effectively operate in smaller environments while still achieving performance comparable to larger nets operating over full state representations we hope to lower barriers to entry for researchers interested in deploying RL onto more complex real world problems and provide new opportunities to study how learning and representation might scale across very large state spaces that could not previously be studied efficiently given computational resource constraints",1
"As both light transport simulation and reinforcement learning are ruled by the same Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, reinforcement learning techniques may be used for photorealistic image synthesis: Efficiency may be dramatically improved by guiding light transport paths by an approximate solution of the integral equation that is learned during rendering. In the light of the recent advances in reinforcement learning for playing games, we investigate the representation of an approximate solution of an integral equation by artificial neural networks and derive a loss function for that purpose. The resulting Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods train neural networks with standard information instead of linear information and naturally are able to generate an arbitrary number of training samples. The methods are demonstrated for applications in light transport simulation.",0
"In this work we explore the connections between integral equations and machine learning. We first consider how integral equations can provide mathematical models that capture key aspects of complex systems. Next, we look at ways in which these models can be used as building blocks within a broader machine learning framework. Finally, we discuss some of the potential benefits of using such methods in practice, including their ability to facilitate efficient computations and improve predictive accuracy. Overall, our findings contribute new insights into both fields and hold promise for advancing future research in related areas.",1
"In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress over the last decade due to advances in deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, many real world problems require more than just predicting outcomes based on inputs; they often involve sequential decision making problems with multiple steps where previous decisions affect future states. In this work we explore policy gradient methods which combine both traditional reinforcement learning algorithms with powerful deep neural network representations in order to solve these kinds of complex tasks. Our results show that our method achieves state of the art performance on several challenging benchmark problems including Atari games and MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Overall, this work shows that by combining powerful models with advanced algorithmic techniques, we can build artificial agents capable of solving tasks that truly matter.",1
"Behavioral skills or policies for autonomous agents are conventionally learned from reward functions, via reinforcement learning, or from demonstrations, via imitation learning. However, both modes of task specification have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufficient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufficient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task specification problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill. Our proposed language-guided policy learning algorithm can integrate an instruction and a sequence of corrections to acquire new skills very quickly. In our experiments, we show that this method can enable a policy to follow instructions and corrections for simulated navigation and manipulation tasks, substantially outperforming direct, non-interactive instruction following.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to policy learning that leverages language meta-learning to improve performance across multiple domains. We propose using pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) models as a guide to learn optimal policies from textual feedback. Our method enables efficient fine-tuning of NLP models for specific task classes and outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms on several benchmark problems. Furthermore, we show that our approach can transfer knowledge learned from one domain to another without retraining, demonstrating its effectiveness at adapting to changing environments. Overall, our work represents a step forward in the development of versatile agents capable of solving complex tasks through self-supervised learning from human feedback.",1
"Despite remarkable successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is not robust to hyperparameterization, implementation details, or small environment changes (Henderson et al. 2017, Zhang et al. 2018). Overcoming such sensitivity is key to making DRL applicable to real world problems. In this paper, we identify sensitivity to time discretization in near continuous-time environments as a critical factor; this covers, e.g., changing the number of frames per second, or the action frequency of the controller. Empirically, we find that Q-learning-based approaches such as Deep Q- learning (Mnih et al., 2015) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (Lillicrap et al., 2015) collapse with small time steps. Formally, we prove that Q-learning does not exist in continuous time. We detail a principled way to build an off-policy RL algorithm that yields similar performances over a wide range of time discretizations, and confirm this robustness empirically.",0
"One potential solution to make deep q-learning (DQL) more robust to time discretization is by using high-frequency sampling techniques that can effectively model short-term behavior. This approach involves generating new data points at regular intervals to approximate continuous time behaviors. By doing so, we can better capture important features of the environment, such as transient effects caused by sudden changes in parameters. Another method could involve adjusting DQL algorithms to account for non-determinism, which can arise from stochasticity in environments. This can include replay buffers with randomized experiences, noise injection during training, and other similar approaches. Overall, these strategies aim to increase the stability and reliability of DQL policies in real-world applications where accurate decision making requires timely and precise responses.",1
"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.",0
"This paper presents soft actor-critic algorithms, which are a class of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods that use neural networks to represent both the actor and critic functions. These algorithms have been shown to be effective in several domains, including games and robotics, due to their ability to handle continuous state spaces and large action spaces. In addition, they can efficiently learn policies that maximize long-term reward without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying environment dynamics or structure. We discuss two specific variants of these algorithms: deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Both DDPG and TRPO rely on approximating the value function using a separate network from the actor network, and they differ in how they balance exploration and exploitation during training. We then present applications of soft actor-critic algorithms to real-world problems such as autonomous driving, robot manipulation, and game playing. Finally, we conclude by highlighting future research directions and potential improvements to these models.",1
"Representation learning is a central challenge across a range of machine learning areas. In reinforcement learning, effective and functional representations have the potential to tremendously accelerate learning progress and solve more challenging problems. Most prior work on representation learning has focused on generative approaches, learning representations that capture all underlying factors of variation in the observation space in a more disentangled or well-ordered manner. In this paper, we instead aim to learn functionally salient representations: representations that are not necessarily complete in terms of capturing all factors of variation in the observation space, but rather aim to capture those factors of variation that are important for decision making -- that are ""actionable."" These representations are aware of the dynamics of the environment, and capture only the elements of the observation that are necessary for decision making rather than all factors of variation, without explicit reconstruction of the observation. We show how these representations can be useful to improve exploration for sparse reward problems, to enable long horizon hierarchical reinforcement learning, and as a state representation for learning policies for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on a number of simulated environments, and compare it to prior methods for representation learning, exploration, and hierarchical reinforcement learning.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving sequential decision making problems across multiple domains. One challenge that remains, however, is how to learn action representations that can effectively guide the behavior of agents towards achieving desired goals. This paper presents a method for learning goal-conditioned policies that can generate actions conditioned on both the current state and a specified goal state. Our approach combines several ideas from previous work in RL to form a novel framework that enables efficient learning of effective policies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on a variety of challenging tasks, including continuous control and navigation problems, where we show significant improvements over existing methods. Overall, this research provides new insights into the learning of actionable representations in RL, paving the way for more advanced solutions in the field.",1
"In many environments only a tiny subset of all states yield high reward. In these cases, few of the interactions with the environment provide a relevant learning signal. Hence, we may want to preferentially train on those high-reward states and the probable trajectories leading to them. To this end, we advocate for the use of a backtracking model that predicts the preceding states that terminate at a given high-reward state. We can train a model which, starting from a high value state (or one that is estimated to have high value), predicts and sample for which the (state, action)-tuples may have led to that high value state. These traces of (state, action) pairs, which we refer to as Recall Traces, sampled from this backtracking model starting from a high value state, are informative as they terminate in good states, and hence we can use these traces to improve a policy. We provide a variational interpretation for this idea and a practical algorithm in which the backtracking model samples from an approximate posterior distribution over trajectories which lead to large rewards. Our method improves the sample efficiency of both on- and off-policy RL algorithms across several environments and tasks.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to reinforcement learning that combines backtracking techniques with efficient modeling algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the learning process. We introduce recall traces as a mechanism for tracking previously experienced states and actions, allowing the agent to effectively reuse past experiences and learn more quickly from them. Our method leverages recent advances in neural network based representations, enabling the agent to accurately capture relevant aspects of the environment without relying on full state representation. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance than previous approaches while requiring significantly less computational resources. Overall, we believe that recall traces represent an important step towards making deep reinforcement learning more accessible and scalable.",1
"Humans and animals can learn complex predictive models that allow them to accurately and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can adapt such models extremely quickly in the face of unexpected changes. Deep neural network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.",0
"In order to solve problems, you have to know that they exist, and in many cases we need artificial intelligence (AI) systems to learn on their own so that they can identify and address such problems automatically. Fortunately, meta learning enables us to train models which quickly adapt to new tasks using very little data, by leveraging knowledge gained from previous experiences. By applying continual adaptation strategies to model predictive control methods like model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), these self-adapting agents can better handle continuous action spaces as well as nonlinear function approximators, while maintaining comparable performance across diverse domains. Our research demonstrates how deep neural network policies trained with MBPO meta learning substantially improve upon traditional approaches in terms of efficiency and final policy quality.

"Very deep convolutional neural networks offer excellent recognition results, yet their computational expense limits their impact for many real-world applications. We introduce BlockDrop, an approach that learns to dynamically choose which layers of a deep network to execute during inference so as to best reduce total computation without degrading prediction accuracy. Exploiting the robustness of Residual Networks (ResNets) to layer dropping, our framework selects on-the-fly which residual blocks to evaluate for a given novel image. In particular, given a pretrained ResNet, we train a policy network in an associative reinforcement learning setting for the dual reward of utilizing a minimal number of blocks while preserving recognition accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet. The results provide strong quantitative and qualitative evidence that these learned policies not only accelerate inference but also encode meaningful visual information. Built upon a ResNet-101 model, our method achieves a speedup of 20\% on average, going as high as 36\% for some images, while maintaining the same 76.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.",0
"""BlockDrop: Dynamic Inference Paths in Residual Networks"" presents a new technique for training residual networks that improves their robustness and accuracy. By dynamically dropping entire blocks of layers during training, we demonstrate how to effectively prune the model while maintaining high performance on a variety of tasks. Our approach allows for more efficient use of computing resources by only training necessary features, resulting in faster convergence and better generalization across different datasets. We evaluate our method using multiple benchmark datasets and show significant improvement over existing techniques such as early stopping and weight decay regularization. This work contributes to the growing body of research exploring methods to reduce computational complexity in deep learning models without sacrificing accuracy, making them easier to train and deploy in real-world applications.""",1
"There are two halves to RL systems: experience collection time and policy learning time. For a large number of samples in rollouts, experience collection time is the major bottleneck. Thus, it is necessary to speed up the rollout generation time with multi-process architecture support. Our work, dubbed WALL-E, utilizes multiple rollout samplers running in parallel to rapidly generate experience. Due to our parallel samplers, we experience not only faster convergence times, but also higher average reward thresholds. For example, on the MuJoCo HalfCheetah-v2 task, with $N = 10$ parallel sampler processes, we are able to achieve much higher average return than those from using only a single process architecture.",0
"In order to train agents using reinforcement learning efficiently, one needs frameworks that can easily scale up their computing power so they can handle large state spaces. OpenAI has developed such a framework called WALL-E, which was designed from scratch with scalability in mind and allows agents to learn more than six orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods. This paper explains how WALL-E works and why it makes training agents on huge spaces possible. By implementing several new design choices like decoupling neural network evaluation from gradient computation and optimizing data movement through the memory hierarchy, this system surpasses any existing deep RL research codebase by far. As it stands now, WALL-E represents the largest model size ever used for deep reinforcement learning research, showing great promise in solving the challenging problems faced in scaling these models even further.",1
"In this paper we revisit the method of off-policy corrections for reinforcement learning (COP-TD) pioneered by Hallak et al. (2017). Under this method, online updates to the value function are reweighted to avoid divergence issues typical of off-policy learning. While Hallak et al.'s solution is appealing, it cannot easily be transferred to nonlinear function approximation. First, it requires a projection step onto the probability simplex; second, even though the operator describing the expected behavior of the off-policy learning algorithm is convergent, it is not known to be a contraction mapping, and hence, may be more unstable in practice. We address these two issues by introducing a discount factor into COP-TD. We analyze the behavior of discounted COP-TD and find it better behaved from a theoretical perspective. We also propose an alternative soft normalization penalty that can be minimized online and obviates the need for an explicit projection step. We complement our analysis with an empirical evaluation of the two techniques in an off-policy setting on the game Pong from the Atari domain where we find discounted COP-TD to be better behaved in practice than the soft normalization penalty. Finally, we perform a more extensive evaluation of discounted COP-TD in 5 games of the Atari domain, where we find performance gains for our approach.",0
"This paper presents a new method for deep reinforcement learning that addresses the problem of covariate shift. In traditional off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms, the policies learned from different states may differ widely due to changes in their underlying distribution. This can cause instability and poor performance during policy evaluation and execution. To address this issue, we propose bootstrapping the covariate shift, which involves training separate local value functions for each state transition and combining them into a global value function using a weighted average. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed approach significantly improves both stability and performance compared to existing methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a valuable tool for large-scale machine learning applications, such as autonomous driving systems.",1
"Reward shaping is one of the most effective methods to tackle the crucial yet challenging problem of credit assignment in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, designing shaping functions usually requires much expert knowledge and hand-engineering, and the difficulties are further exacerbated given multiple similar tasks to solve. In this paper, we consider reward shaping on a distribution of tasks, and propose a general meta-learning framework to automatically learn the efficient reward shaping on newly sampled tasks, assuming only shared state space but not necessarily action space. We first derive the theoretically optimal reward shaping in terms of credit assignment in model-free RL. We then propose a value-based meta-learning algorithm to extract an effective prior over the optimal reward shaping. The prior can be applied directly to new tasks, or provably adapted to the task-posterior while solving the task within few gradient updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our shaping through significantly improved learning efficiency and interpretable visualizations across various settings, including notably a successful transfer from DQN to DDPG.",0
"Meta learning refers to the ability of machine learning algorithms to learn how to learn from different tasks. In recent years, meta-learning has become increasingly important as more and more complex models have been developed that require significant amounts of training data. One challenge faced by these models is ensuring they receive appropriate rewards during training. This process is known as reward shaping.  In this paper, we present a novel method for enhancing reward shaping through meta-learning. Our approach involves pretraining a set of reinforcement learning agents on a variety of tasks, using meta learning techniques to enhance their performance across all tasks. These trained agents then form a pool of policies that can be used to guide new agents as they begin exploring a specific task. By leveraging the knowledge gained through meta-learning, our proposed method allows new agents to quickly converge on optimal solutions without requiring excessive trial and error.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on several benchmark domains. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our algorithm achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the number of training episodes required. Overall, our results highlight the promise of meta-learning based approaches for improving reward shaping in complex machine learning systems.",1
"Complex environments and tasks pose a difficult problem for holistic end-to-end learning approaches. Decomposition of an environment into interacting controllable and non-controllable objects allows supervised learning for non-controllable objects and universal value function approximator learning for controllable objects. Such decomposition should lead to a shorter learning time and better generalisation capability. Here, we consider arcade-game environments as sets of interacting objects (controllable, non-controllable) and propose a set of functional modules that are specialized on mastering different types of interactions in a broad range of environments. The modules utilize regression, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Results of this case study in different Atari games suggest that human-level performance can be achieved by a learning agent within a human amount of game experience (10-15 minutes game time) when a proper decomposition of an environment or a task is provided. However, automatization of such decomposition remains a challenging problem. This case study shows how a model of a causal structure underlying an environment or a task can benefit learning time and generalization capability of the agent, and argues in favor of exploiting modular structure in contrast to using pure end-to-end learning approaches.",0

Our results show that by modularizing the learning process, we achieved better generalization across different levels, improved robustness against adversarial perturbations, and reduced training time. Overall, our approach demonstrates the feasibility of applying MENDL to complex real world problems and could have significant implications for other domains where end-to-end learning has been challenged due to lack of prior knowledge or computation constraints.",1
"Dynamic portfolio optimization is the process of sequentially allocating wealth to a collection of assets in some consecutive trading periods, based on investors' return-risk profile. Automating this process with machine learning remains a challenging problem. Here, we design a deep reinforcement learning (RL) architecture with an autonomous trading agent such that, investment decisions and actions are made periodically, based on a global objective, with autonomy. In particular, without relying on a purely model-free RL agent, we train our trading agent using a novel RL architecture consisting of an infused prediction module (IPM), a generative adversarial data augmentation module (DAM) and a behavior cloning module (BCM). Our model-based approach works with both on-policy or off-policy RL algorithms. We further design the back-testing and execution engine which interact with the RL agent in real time. Using historical {\em real} financial market data, we simulate trading with practical constraints, and demonstrate that our proposed model is robust, profitable and risk-sensitive, as compared to baseline trading strategies and model-free RL agents from prior work.",0
"This paper focuses on applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to dynamic portfolio optimization problems by leveraging model predictive control based on Monte Carlo simulation models. In contrast to traditional RL methods that directly optimize objective functions or cumulative rewards, our approach seeks to maximize both expected returns and risk management via efficient model calibration. We apply two different deep Q-learning algorithms that learn optimal policies from trial-and-error interactions with simulated financial markets. Our numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements in risk-adjusted return performance compared to benchmark strategies such as mean variance optimization or minimum spanning trees. Moreover, sensitivity analyses show robustness against parameter changes in underlying market dynamics, asset correlations, or learning rates. Overall, we believe that this work extends current state-of-the art methods for quantitative investment managers who seek advanced trading signals with enhanced adaptability and flexibility. Future research directions could involve incorporating more complex financial instruments, alternative machine learning architectures, or uncertainty quantification techniques into the proposed framework. This paper explores how advanced artificial intelligence can improve the process of portfolio optimization. By utilizing sophisticated statistical models to predict future outcomes, the algorithm can make better investment decisions than human experts alone. Specifically, deep learning technology allows the system to detect subtle patterns and trends which would otherwise go unnoticed. These insights enable more accurate predictions of returns, reducing risk while still generating strong profits. Results are verified through rigorous testing using historical data, confirming the value of these innovative techniques. Despite limitations due to computational requirements, implementation of this methodology promises substantial benefits for wealth managers seeking superior results. Further refinements and adaptations should continue to enhance effectiveness, solidifying the promise of advanced machine learning in finance.",1
"Discrete-action algorithms have been central to numerous recent successes of deep reinforcement learning. However, applying these algorithms to high-dimensional action tasks requires tackling the combinatorial increase of the number of possible actions with the number of action dimensions. This problem is further exacerbated for continuous-action tasks that require fine control of actions via discretization. In this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture featuring a shared decision module followed by several network branches, one for each action dimension. This approach achieves a linear increase of the number of network outputs with the number of degrees of freedom by allowing a level of independence for each individual action dimension. To illustrate the approach, we present a novel agent, called Branching Dueling Q-Network (BDQ), as a branching variant of the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (Dueling DDQN). We evaluate the performance of our agent on a set of challenging continuous control tasks. The empirical results show that the proposed agent scales gracefully to environments with increasing action dimensionality and indicate the significance of the shared decision module in coordination of the distributed action branches. Furthermore, we show that the proposed agent performs competitively against a state-of-the-art continuous control algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).",0
"This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning architecture called action branching (AB). AB addresses two limitations of standard deep RL algorithms: their tendency to take myopic actions and their sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to standard architectures that output a single policy, AB outputs multiple policies that each correspond to a different level of uncertainty. These uncertain policies provide more contextualized guidance than certain policies alone. As a result, agents using AB explore less but still learn effectively by taking informed actions based on learned uncertainties. We demonstrate AB's effectiveness across several continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art RL algorithms in most settings without needing careful fine-tuning. Our results suggest that combining model uncertainty quantification with value estimation allows effective search and exploitation in complex environments.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) agents surpass human-level performances in a multitude of tasks. However, the direct mapping from states to actions makes it hard to interpret the rationale behind the decision making of agents. In contrast to previous a-posteriori methods of visualizing DeepRL policies, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework based on Rainbow, a representative Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent. Our method automatically learns important regions in the input domain, which enables characterizations of the decision making and interpretations for non-intuitive behaviors. Hence we name it Region Sensitive Rainbow (RS-Rainbow). RS-Rainbow utilizes a simple yet effective mechanism to incorporate visualization ability into the learning model, not only improving model interpretability, but leading to improved performance. Extensive experiments on the challenging platform of Atari 2600 demonstrate the superiority of RS-Rainbow. In particular, our agent achieves state of the art at just 25% of the training frames.

"It has recently been shown that if feedback effects of decisions are ignored, then imposing fairness constraints such as demographic parity or equality of opportunity can actually exacerbate unfairness. We propose to address this challenge by modeling feedback effects as the dynamics of a Markov decision processes (MDPs). First, we define analogs of fairness properties that have been proposed for supervised learning. Second, we propose algorithms for learning fair decision-making policies for MDPs. We also explore extensions to reinforcement learning, where parts of the dynamical system are unknown and must be learned without violating fairness. Finally, we demonstrate the need to account for dynamical effects using simulations on a loan applicant MDP.",0
"In this paper we explore fairness considerations arising from dynamics such as change over time, feedback effects, adaptation, interactions among agents or players etc. We introduce formal models of games that incorporate dynamic elements beyond just static payoffs matrices, including recursive games with stagewise updates where the game itself changes each period depending on current decisions of players (e.g. in investment or innovation races), or adaptive models with learning or evolutionary play. We look at both positive analyses characterizing solutions to these dynamic problems as well as normative considerations towards designing rules promoting desirable fair outcomes in the face of such complexity. Our results have applications in areas like competition policy in high tech markets, environmental regulation interacting with technology adoption, standard setting agreements, intellectual property design affecting cumulative innovation process and more. We discuss how our new approach helps reframe classic issues regarding fairness across time and levels of disaggregation, provides novel insights even for static problems in terms of comparing Pareto efficient allocations under different equity criteria, and yields surprising implications challenging recent work by others claiming the demise of equity concerns in certain growth models attributing all progress ultimately to exogenous technological diffusion.",1
"Although exploration in reinforcement learning is well understood from a theoretical point of view, provably correct methods remain impractical. In this paper we study the interplay between exploration and approximation, what we call approximate exploration. Our main goal is to further our theoretical understanding of pseudo-count based exploration bonuses (Bellemare et al., 2016), a practical exploration scheme based on density modelling. As a warm-up, we quantify the performance of an exploration algorithm, MBIE-EB (Strehl and Littman, 2008), when explicitly combined with state aggregation. This allows us to confirm that, as might be expected, approximation allows the agent to trade off between learning speed and quality of the learned policy. Next, we show how a given density model can be related to an abstraction and that the corresponding pseudo-count bonus can act as a substitute in MBIE-EB combined with this abstraction, but may lead to either under- or over-exploration. Then, we show that a given density model also defines an implicit abstraction, and find a surprising mismatch between pseudo-counts derived either implicitly or explicitly. Finally we derive a new pseudo-count bonus alleviating this issue.",0
"""In this work, we present a novel approach to exploring complex systems using state abstraction techniques. The key idea behind our method is that instead of trying to model every detail of a system, we can use approximate models that capture only the most important features. By doing so, we can significantly reduce the computational cost of exploration while still obtaining accurate results. Our approach builds on recent advances in machine learning and control theory to learn low-dimensional representations of system states that capture their essential characteristics. These representations are then used to guide exploratory actions, ensuring that they effectively probe the relevant aspects of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging problems including robotics tasks and simulations of complex physical phenomena. Our results show that our method achieves better performance than existing methods at reduced computational costs.""",1
"Exploration bonus derived from the novelty of the states in an environment has become a popular approach to motivate exploration for deep reinforcement learning agents in the past few years. Recent methods such as curiosity-driven exploration usually estimate the novelty of new observations by the prediction errors of their system dynamics models. Due to the capacity limitation of the models and difficulty of performing next-frame prediction, however, these methods typically fail to balance between exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional observation tasks, resulting in the agents forgetting the visited paths and exploring those states repeatedly. Such inefficient exploration behavior causes significant performance drops, especially in large environments with sparse reward signals. In this paper, we propose to introduce the concept of optical flow estimation from the field of computer vision to deal with the above issue. We propose to employ optical flow estimation errors to examine the novelty of new observations, such that agents are able to memorize and understand the visited states in a more comprehensive fashion. We compare our method against the previous approaches in a number of experimental experiments. Our results indicate that the proposed method appears to deliver superior and long-lasting performance than the previous methods. We further provide a set of comprehensive ablative analysis of the proposed method, and investigate the impact of optical flow estimation on the learning curves of the DRL agents.",0

Our approach leverages temporal consistency constraints and adversarial regularization to improve the accuracy and robustness of the estimated flows.

"While deep reinforcement learning has successfully solved many challenging control tasks, its real-world applicability has been limited by the inability to ensure the safety of learned policies. We propose an approach to verifiable reinforcement learning by training decision tree policies, which can represent complex policies (since they are nonparametric), yet can be efficiently verified using existing techniques (since they are highly structured). The challenge is that decision tree policies are difficult to train. We propose VIPER, an algorithm that combines ideas from model compression and imitation learning to learn decision tree policies guided by a DNN policy (called the oracle) and its Q-function, and show that it substantially outperforms two baselines. We use VIPER to (i) learn a provably robust decision tree policy for a variant of Atari Pong with a symbolic state space, (ii) learn a decision tree policy for a toy game based on Pong that provably never loses, and (iii) learn a provably stable decision tree policy for cart-pole. In each case, the decision tree policy achieves performance equal to that of the original DNN policy.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms allow agents to learn skills and strategies to perform complex tasks without detailed instructions or expensive labelled training examples.

However, despite the efficiency and versatility of NN-based RL agents, their decision-making remains incomprehensible, reducing their utilities. To deploy RL into a wider range of applications, it is imperative to develop explainable NN-based RL agents.

"Abstract: In recent years, meta-learning has emerged as a promising approach for improving machine learning algorithms by training them on a set of tasks rather than just one. However, most existing work on meta-learning focuses solely on optimizing performance based on reward signals alone, without taking into account causality - that is, understanding why certain decisions lead to good or bad outcomes. This paper presents a new framework called ""Causal Reasoning from Meta-Reinforcement Learning"" (CRML) that integrates causality analysis within meta-learning frameworks, enabling agents to reason about cause-and-effect relationships between actions and outcomes. Our method draws upon recent advances in graphical models and deep learning, allowing us to estimate causal graphs from observational data generated during meta-training. We evaluate our approach using several benchmark domains across different meta-reinforcement learning settings, demonstrating improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines on these tasks. These results highlight the importance of considering causal reasoning within meta-learning frameworks, paving the way for future research exploring more advanced forms of multi-task adaptation, robustness, generalization, and transferability of learned knowledge across a diverse range of environments. Overall, CRML represents a significant step towards more intelligent and human-like decision making in artificial intelligence.",1
"Policy evaluation is a key process in reinforcement learning. It assesses a given policy using estimation of the corresponding value function. When using a parameterized function to approximate the value, it is common to optimize the set of parameters by minimizing the sum of squared Bellman Temporal Differences errors. However, this approach ignores certain distributional properties of both the errors and value parameters. Taking these distributions into account in the optimization process can provide useful information on the amount of confidence in value estimation. In this work we propose to optimize the value by minimizing a regularized objective function which forms a trust region over its parameters. We present a novel optimization method, the Kalman Optimization for Value Approximation (KOVA), based on the Extended Kalman Filter. KOVA minimizes the regularized objective function by adopting a Bayesian perspective over both the value parameters and noisy observed returns. This distributional property provides information on parameter uncertainty in addition to value estimates. We provide theoretical results of our approach and analyze the performance of our proposed optimizer on domains with large state and action spaces.",0
"Trust Region Value Optimization (TRVO) algorithms have been used successfully in many applications due to their efficiency and robustness.

The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.",0

"This paper addresses the question of how a previously available control policy $\pi_s$ can be used as a supervisor to more quickly and safely train a new learned control policy $\pi_L$ for a robot. A weighted average of the supervisor and learned policies is used during trials, with a heavier weight initially on the supervisor, in order to allow safe and useful physical trials while the learned policy is still ineffective. During the process, the weight is adjusted to favor the learned policy. As weights are adjusted, the learned network must compensate so as to give safe and reasonable outputs under the different weights. A pioneer network is introduced that pre-learns a policy that performs similarly to the current learned policy under the planned next step for new weights; this pioneer network then replaces the currently learned network in the next set of trials. Experiments in OpenAI Gym demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0

"The problem of retrosynthetic planning can be framed as one player game, in which the chemist (or a computer program) works backwards from a molecular target to simpler starting materials though a series of choices regarding which reactions to perform. This game is challenging as the combinatorial space of possible choices is astronomical, and the value of each choice remains uncertain until the synthesis plan is completed and its cost evaluated. Here, we address this problem using deep reinforcement learning to identify policies that make (near) optimal reaction choices during each step of retrosynthetic planning. Using simulated experience or self-play, we train neural networks to estimate the expected synthesis cost or value of any given molecule based on a representation of its molecular structure. We show that learned policies based on this value network outperform heuristic approaches in synthesizing unfamiliar molecules from available starting materials using the fewest number of reactions. We discuss how the learned policies described here can be incorporated into existing synthesis planning tools and how they can be adapted to changes in the synthesis cost objective or material availability.",0
"Retrosynthesis is a method used in organic synthesis to plan backwards from the target molecule to identify starting materials and reactions required to produce the desired product. In recent years, machine learning has been applied to aid in retrosynthetic planning by generating possible reaction paths that can lead to the target molecule. This paper presents a new approach to learning retrosynthetic planning using self-play algorithms inspired by reinforcement learning. By allowing the algorithm to play against itself in virtual labs, it learns from trial and error to improve its decision making process. Results show that this method outperforms traditional heuristic approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Overall, the proposed framework holds potential for accelerating drug discovery and streamlining chemical synthesis efforts in industry.",1
"We give a simple optimistic algorithm for which it is easy to derive regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t_{\rm mix} SAT})$ after $T$ steps in uniformly ergodic Markov decision processes with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and mixing time parameter $t_{\rm mix}$.

"Incorporate key concepts such as regret bounds, reinforcement learning and markov chains and highlight how your work contributes to existing research. Keywords: regret bounds, reinforcement learning, markov chain concentration In this paper we present a new approach to deriving regret bounds for reinforcement learning algorithms based on techniques from probability theory. We show that by analyzing the behavior of a Markov chain associated with a given algorithm, we can establish upper bounds on the expected cumulative regret over time. Our method relies on recent results from the field of Markov chain concentration, which allows us to control the deviation of certain random variables from their mean value. By applying these tools to a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, we demonstrate that our approach leads to tight regret bounds that improve upon previous results in the literature. Overall, our work provides insights into the performance limits of reinforcement learning algorithms under different assumptions and helps pave the way towards more efficient and reliable decision making in complex environments.",1
"We use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn dexterous in-hand manipulation policies which can perform vision-based object reorientation on a physical Shadow Dexterous Hand. The training is performed in a simulated environment in which we randomize many of the physical properties of the system like friction coefficients and an object's appearance. Our policies transfer to the physical robot despite being trained entirely in simulation. Our method does not rely on any human demonstrations, but many behaviors found in human manipulation emerge naturally, including finger gaiting, multi-finger coordination, and the controlled use of gravity. Our results were obtained using the same distributed RL system that was used to train OpenAI Five. We also include a video of our results: https://youtu.be/jwSbzNHGflM",0
"This is the abstract: Learning dexterous manipulation skills requires understanding how our hand movements affect objects in the world. Prior work has focused on learning these skills from scratch using either simulation or real-world interactions, but lacks robustness due to limited exploration and safety concerns. To overcome these challenges, we present a new algorithm that integrates both simulated and real-world data into one framework. By exploiting domain randomization, our method enables safe zero-shot transfer across environments without the need for fine-tuning on individual target domains. We demonstrate improved success rates compared to previous methods by training agents directly on complex tasks such as block stacking and assembly games. Our approach allows robots to learn from humans and adapt their behaviors based on human feedback, opening up possibilities for interactive robot programming through demonstration. This research focuses on enhancing the capabilities of machines to manipulate objects in diverse settings. Current methods have certain limitations which prevent them from achieving desired results. Researchers here propose a hybrid approach combining simulations and real-world interaction. Using domain randomisation, they improve upon existing techniques allowing for seamless transfers across different environments. This leads to better task completion performances surpassing current state-of-the-art models. With the ability to learn from human users, these robots can dynamically adjust their actions towards successful outcomes. These advancements provide a promising pathway for intuitive robotic programming via demonstrations.",1
"Machine learning models have become more and more complex in order to better approximate complex functions. Although fruitful in many domains, the added complexity has come at the cost of model interpretability. The once popular k-nearest neighbors (kNN) approach, which finds and uses the most similar data for reasoning, has received much less attention in recent decades due to numerous problems when compared to other techniques. We show that many of these historical problems with kNN can be overcome, and our contribution has applications not only in machine learning but also in online learning, data synthesis, anomaly detection, model compression, and reinforcement learning, without sacrificing interpretability. We introduce a synthesis between kNN and information theory that we hope will provide a clear path towards models that are innately interpretable and auditable. Through this work we hope to gather interest in combining kNN with information theory as a promising path to fully auditable machine learning and artificial intelligence.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results from our work exploring natively interpretable machine learning (ML) models, which have the unique advantage of being human-interpretable at runtime without requiring posthoc rationalization of their decision making process. Our experiments demonstrate that by using appropriate visual representations and interactions during training, we can improve interpretability and reduce error rates over traditional methods such as layerwise relevance propagation (LRP). We believe that these findings could lay the foundation for building more transparent and trustworthy ML systems with applications in fields where explainability is critical, such as healthcare or finance. Furthermore, by incorporating domain knowledge into model design, it may also lead to more accurate predictions. Ultimately, our goal is to bridge the gap between ML research and industry adoption by providing practical solutions for creating more effective and interpretable models in real-world scenarios.",1
"Building upon the recent success of deep reinforcement learning methods, we investigate the possibility of on-policy reinforcement learning improvement by reusing the data from several consecutive policies. On-policy methods bring many benefits, such as ability to evaluate each resulting policy. However, they usually discard all the information about the policies which existed before. In this work, we propose adaptation of the replay buffer concept, borrowed from the off-policy learning setting, to create the method, combining advantages of on- and off-policy learning. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm generalises the $Q$-, value and advantage functions for data from multiple policies. The method uses trust region optimisation, while avoiding some of the common problems of the algorithms such as TRPO or ACKTR: it uses hyperparameters to replace the trust region selection heuristics, as well as the trainable covariance matrix instead of the fixed one. In many cases, the method not only improves the results comparing to the state-of-the-art trust region on-policy learning algorithms such as PPO, ACKTR and TRPO, but also with respect to their off-policy counterpart DDPG.",0
"This paper presents on-policy trust region policy optimization (TRPO), which combines two main ideas: conservative updates inspired by TRPO while maintaining importance sampling corrections via replay buffers. Our algorithm adapts the learning rate of policy improvement based on the maximum correction distance observed so far during that epoch/iteration. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on MuJoCo tasks using only CPU simulations. In addition, we find that our method improves stability over baseline methods, especially under random seeds and hyperparameters settings. Lastly, we validate our approach on real robots achieving impressive zero-shot generalization across five downstream manipulation tasks without any fine-tuning. To sum up, we provide extensive analyses to showcase that our proposed solution effectively balances exploration and exploitation enabling efficient policy search on challenging continuous control problems.",1
"We propose a hierarchically structured reinforcement learning approach to address the challenges of planning for generating coherent multi-sentence stories for the visual storytelling task. Within our framework, the task of generating a story given a sequence of images is divided across a two-level hierarchical decoder. The high-level decoder constructs a plan by generating a semantic concept (i.e., topic) for each image in sequence. The low-level decoder generates a sentence for each image using a semantic compositional network, which effectively grounds the sentence generation conditioned on the topic. The two decoders are jointly trained end-to-end using reinforcement learning. We evaluate our model on the visual storytelling (VIST) dataset. Empirical results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed hierarchically structured reinforced training achieves significantly better performance compared to a strong flat deep reinforcement learning baseline.",0
"This abstract presents a method that utilizes hierarchical structuring for reinforcement learning in natural language generation tasks. We introduce topically coherent visual story generation as our test domain which involves the creation of multiple sentences that describe events happening in an image while ensuring each sentence can stand alone as well. Our approach uses two levels of hierarchy where the high level planning selects a topic/prompt for a scene while low level policy generates text corresponding to it. We employ reward shaping techniques based on human feedback obtained through Amazon Mechanical Turk to ensure that agent policies match user preferences. Experiments performed show improvement over previous work in terms of automatic metrics such as BLEU score, diversity measures like self-BLEU and distinctiveness metric, and subjective ones by human evaluations via Amazon Turks. Additionally, we observe an increase in number of topics covered indicating higher coverage by our trained agents compared to past results. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the proposed framework improves performance in generating coherent stories relevant to given images. Furthermore, future applications could benefit from incorporating the introduced approach into larger NLP pipelines to tackle complex problems beyond one task setting.",1
"Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are biological neural circuits capable of producing coordinated rhythmic outputs in the absence of rhythmic input. As a result, they are responsible for most rhythmic motion in living organisms. This rhythmic control is broadly applicable to fields such as locomotive robotics and medical devices. In this paper, we explore the possibility of creating a self-sustaining CPG network for reinforcement learning that learns rhythmic motion more efficiently and across more general environments than the current multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline models. Recent work introduces the Structured Control Net (SCN), which maintains linear and nonlinear modules for local and global control, respectively. Here, we show that time-sequence architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) model CPGs effectively. Combining previous work with RNNs and SCNs, we introduce the Recurrent Control Net (RCN), which adds a linear component to the, RCNs match and exceed the performance of baseline MLPs and SCNs across all environment tasks. Our findings confirm existing intuitions for RNNs on reinforcement learning tasks, and demonstrate promise of SCN-like structures in reinforcement learning.",0

"This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that enhances exploration by amplifying the imitation effect (AIE). This algorithm consists of self-imitation learning and random network distillation algorithms. We argue that these two algorithms complement each other and that combining these two algorithms can amplify the imitation effect for exploration. In addition, by adding an intrinsic penalty reward to the state that the RL agent frequently visits and using replay memory for learning the feature state when using an exploration bonus, the proposed approach leads to deep exploration and deviates from the current converged policy. We verified the exploration performance of the algorithm through experiments in a two-dimensional grid environment. In addition, we applied the algorithm to a simulated environment of unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) mission execution, and the empirical results show that AIE is very effective for finding the UCAV's shortest flight path to avoid an enemy's missiles.",0

"This paper proposes CodeX, an end-to-end framework that facilitates encoding, bitwidth customization, fine-tuning, and implementation of neural networks on FPGA platforms. CodeX incorporates nonlinear encoding to the computation flow of neural networks to save memory. The encoded features demand significantly lower storage compared to the raw full-precision activation values; therefore, the execution flow of CodeX hardware engine is completely performed within the FPGA using on-chip streaming buffers with no access to the off-chip DRAM. We further propose a fully-automated algorithm inspired by reinforcement learning which determines the customized encoding bitwidth across network layers. CodeX full-stack framework comprises of a compiler which takes a high-level Python description of an arbitrary neural network architecture. The compiler then instantiates the corresponding elements from CodeX Hardware library for FPGA implementation. Proof-of-concept evaluations on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate an average of 4.65x throughput improvement compared to stand-alone weight encoding. We further compare CodeX with six existing full-precision DNN accelerators on ImageNet, showing an average of 3.6x and 2.54x improvement in throughput and performance-per-watt, respectively.",0
"One key challenge facing modern deep neural networks (DNNs) is their high computational cost, which can make inference on low-power devices challenging. In response, specialized hardware such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have emerged as a promising solution, offering both performance and flexibility.

"We study the computational tractability of PAC reinforcement learning with rich observations. We present new provably sample-efficient algorithms for environments with deterministic hidden state dynamics and stochastic rich observations. These methods operate in an oracle model of computation -- accessing policy and value function classes exclusively through standard optimization primitives -- and therefore represent computationally efficient alternatives to prior algorithms that require enumeration. With stochastic hidden state dynamics, we prove that the only known sample-efficient algorithm, OLIVE, cannot be implemented in the oracle model. We also present several examples that illustrate fundamental challenges of tractable PAC reinforcement learning in such general settings.",0
"Incorporating rich observations into model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been shown to significantly improve their efficiency and sample complexity. These algorithms rely on interacting with the environment more efficiently by leveraging information from previous interactions stored in memory, resulting in faster convergence rates and better overall performance compared to conventional Q-learning methods. However, designing such oracle-efficient RL agents remains challenging due to the difficulty of incorporating external memory requirements, which often require careful tuning for different tasks. This work proposes a simple yet efficient algorithm that addresses these shortcomings by providing an easy mechanism for integrating rich observational history into model-free RL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive empirical evaluations across several domains, including classic control problems and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

"Model compression is a critical technique to efficiently deploy neural network models on mobile devices which have limited computation resources and tight power budgets. Conventional model compression techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics and rule-based policies that require domain experts to explore the large design space trading off among model size, speed, and accuracy, which is usually sub-optimal and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoML for Model Compression (AMC) which leverage reinforcement learning to provide the model compression policy. This learning-based compression policy outperforms conventional rule-based compression policy by having higher compression ratio, better preserving the accuracy and freeing human labor. Under 4x FLOPs reduction, we achieved 2.7% better accuracy than the handcrafted model compression policy for VGG-16 on ImageNet.

"In recent years imitation learning has emerged as one of the leading approaches to artificial intelligence (AI). The idea behind imitation learning is simple yet powerful—train a machine to learn from human demonstrations of tasks without explicitly programming instructions on how to perform them. By mimicking the actions of humans, machines can quickly acquire new skills and knowledge that would otherwise take extensive training to achieve. This approach has been applied successfully across many different fields such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing. Despite the successes of imitation learning there remains a gap in our understanding of how these algorithms work and why they converge globally. Our paper seeks to address this gap by introducing linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory into the study of imitation learning. LQR provides a theoretical framework for studying systems that are governed by linear differential equations and quadratic costs. We show how LQR can explain global convergence in imitation learning by analyzing the gradient flow of error between the model and expert trajectories. Our analysis reveals insights into the speed at which models converge to experts and provides guidance for improving the performance of imitation learning algorithms.

"Automatically generating the descriptions of an image, i.e., image captioning, is an important and fundamental topic in artificial intelligence, which bridges the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. Based on the successful deep learning models, especially the CNN model and Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) with attention mechanism, we propose a hierarchical attention model by utilizing both of the global CNN features and the local object features for more effective feature representation and reasoning in image captioning. The generative adversarial network (GAN), together with a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, is applied to solve the exposure bias problem in RNN-based supervised training for language problems. In addition, through the automatic measurement of the consistency between the generated caption and the image content by the discriminator in the GAN framework and RL optimization, we make the finally generated sentences more accurate and natural. Comprehensive experiments show the improved performance of the hierarchical attention mechanism and the effectiveness of our RL-based optimization method.

"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing deep learning models for image caption generation. This task requires generating descriptive text that accurately describes the content of an input image. Despite their success at other natural language processing tasks, current methods struggle to generate high quality captions due to issues such as insufficient context utilization, limited understanding of relationships among image regions and objects, lack of diversity in generated descriptions, etc. In this work, we present an approach that addresses these challenges by combining attention mechanisms capable of capturing multiple levels of representation with gradient optimization based policy search. Our method, named HAPI (Hierarchical Attention Mechanism and Policy Gradient Optimization), first generates a structured latent representation from the image features using multi-scale feature maps organized into three layers: coarse (global image structure), medium (regional object layouts), fine (local details). Then, it applies two attention modules in parallel – one operating across different scales, another exploiting spatial dependencies within each scale – followed by LSTM decoder to produce the final captions. We optimize our model through both reinforcement learning from human feedback (using REINFORCE algorithm) and supervised learning from ground truth annotations. To encourage diverse and accurate descriptions, we introduce a novel evaluation metric focused on the relative frequency of noun phrases extracted from the captions rather than their overall accuracy. Experimental results show substantial improvements over several baseline methods across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

"Algorithmic assurances from advanced autonomous systems assist human users in understanding, trusting, and using such systems appropriately. Designing these systems with the capacity of assessing their own capabilities is one approach to creating an algorithmic assurance. The idea of `machine self-confidence' is introduced for autonomous systems. Using a factorization based framework for self-confidence assessment, one component of self-confidence, called `solver-quality', is discussed in the context of Markov decision processes for autonomous systems. Markov decision processes underlie much of the theory of reinforcement learning, and are commonly used for planning and decision making under uncertainty in robotics and autonomous systems. A `solver quality' metric is formally defined in the context of decision making algorithms based on Markov decision processes. A method for assessing solver quality is then derived, drawing inspiration from empirical hardness models. Finally, numerical experiments for an unmanned autonomous vehicle navigation problem under different solver, parameter, and environment conditions indicate that the self-confidence metric exhibits the desired properties. Discussion of results, and avenues for future investigation are included.",0

This can be done within the space limit given above - I would recommend writing around 200 words. --- This research contributes several novel ideas to improve decision making by learning agents. Firstly, we propose the concept of machine self-confidence: the ability of an agent to judge whether it can solve a problem based only on its own reasoning and observations; no external feedback required. We formalize two axiomatic definitions and show that they imply standard (Bayesian) confidence intervals. Secondly, we define factorization functions which turn complex models into a set of simpler ones; these admit more elegant and interpretable inference procedures yet maintain correctness guarantees. Thirdly, our work provides algorithms to learn these quantities online which enables planning under uncertainty using the proposed concepts without relying on exact model knowledge. Empirical results validate that this framework significantly improves policy evaluation and execution compared to alternative methods like Monte Carlo tree search and UCT.",1
"Despite the success of single-agent reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains challenging due to complex interactions between agents. Motivated by decentralized applications such as sensor networks, swarm robotics, and power grids, we study policy evaluation in MARL, where agents with jointly observed state-action pairs and private local rewards collaborate to learn the value of a given policy. In this paper, we propose a double averaging scheme, where each agent iteratively performs averaging over both space and time to incorporate neighboring gradient information and local reward information, respectively. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a global geometric rate. In particular, such an algorithm is built upon a primal-dual reformulation of the mean squared projected Bellman error minimization problem, which gives rise to a decentralized convex-concave saddle-point problem. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed double averaging primal-dual optimization algorithm is the first to achieve fast finite-time convergence on decentralized convex-concave saddle-point problems.",0

We consider scenarios in which multiple agents make decisions that affect one another’s outcomes. Our primary contribution is a new algorithm called Double Averaging Primal-Dual Optimization (DA-PDO). DA-PDO combines primal-dual optimization methods commonly used in mathematical programming with a double averaging procedure from MARL literature to address stability issues arising from decentralized implementation. Through experiments on both cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments, we show improved performance over standard policy gradient methods and other state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. Furthermore, we provide insights into the conditions under which double averaging can improve convergence rates. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach as a scalable solution for solving large-scale, complex MARL problems.  The proposed methodology utilizes Double Averaging Primal-Dual Optimization (DA-PDO), by merging primal-dual optimization techniques often employed within mathematical programming together with a double averaging process developed from multi-agent reinforcement learning literatures to fix unsteadiness caused by distributed execution.

"We consider the problem of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in deep reinforcement learning. In a value based reinforcement learning setting, we propose to use uncertainty estimation techniques directly on the agent's value estimating neural network to detect OOD samples. The focus of our work lies in analyzing the suitability of approximate Bayesian inference methods and related ensembling techniques that generate uncertainty estimates. Although prior work has shown that dropout-based variational inference techniques and bootstrap-based approaches can be used to model epistemic uncertainty, the suitability for detecting OOD samples in deep reinforcement learning remains an open question. Our results show that uncertainty estimation can be used to differentiate in- from out-of-distribution samples. Over the complete training process of the reinforcement learning agents, bootstrap-based approaches tend to produce more reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates, when compared to dropout-based approaches.",0
"Despite the remarkable success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on complex tasks, detecting when a model is making predictions out of its learned distribution remains challenging. This work presents a new uncertainty-based approach, where the agent explicitly models predictive uncertainty over actions. We then show that during test time we can use these predicted uncertainties to discard highly uncertain or potentially invalid decisions made by the agent. Our method improves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains, such as continuous control, multi-agent environments, and navigation. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis suggesting that our algorithm generalizes better than other competitive approaches under misspecified model assumptions. In summary, this work explores the application of predictive uncertainty in DRL towards achieving effective OOD detection via discarding highly uncertain decisions. With favorable experimental results and theoretically grounded insights, uncertainty estimation represents a promising direction for future research at the intersection of DRL and robust decision making.",1
"In real-world scenarios, it is appealing to learn a model carrying out stochastic operations internally, known as stochastic computation graphs (SCGs), rather than learning a deterministic mapping. However, standard backpropagation is not applicable to SCGs. We attempt to address this issue from the angle of cost propagation, with local surrogate costs, called Q-functions, constructed and learned for each stochastic node in an SCG. Then, the SCG can be trained based on these surrogate costs using standard backpropagation. We propose the entire framework as a solution to generalize backpropagation for SCGs, which resembles an actor-critic architecture but based on a graph. For broad applicability, we study a variety of SCG structures from one cost to multiple costs. We utilize recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and variational Bayes (VB), such as off-policy critic learning and unbiased-and-low-variance gradient estimation, and review them in the context of SCGs. The generalized backpropagation extends transported learning signals beyond gradients between stochastic nodes while preserving the benefit of backpropagating gradients through deterministic nodes. Experimental suggestions and concerns are listed to help design and test any specific model using this framework.",0
"This paper presents Backprop-Q, a novel algorithm that extends backpropagation to computation graphs containing stochastic nodes such as dropout or batch normalization. We show how to compute gradients through these operations by treating their parameters like implicit noise variables which must themselves be inferred from data. With a single unified framework able to handle both deterministic and stochastic architectures, we demonstrate improved performance across several benchmark datasets including SVHN, CIFAR-10, CelebA, and ImageNet. Our approach provides new ways to debug, optimize and ensemble models containing these key components while improving accessibility for users. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/backprop}.  The prevalence of deep learning has led to a rapid expansion of model architectures employing randomness, either as explicit drops (e.g., DropConnect) or implicit ones (e.g., batch norm). These random choices affect gradient calculation during training due to the random nature of dropouts and non-deterministic scales in batch normalization. Consequently standard backpropagation becomes difficult since we cannot differentiate arbitrary functions with respect to arbitrary distributions except in trivial cases. Existing methods address these challenges in different manners. Straight Through Estimators (STEs) \cite{Bengio2013} blindly passes gradients through non-differentiable components; Gumbel Softmax Approximations (GSA) \cite{Jang2016categoricalReparameterization}, variational inference via Monte Carlo sampling; reparametrizations such as ReLU \cite{Kingma_2015}; and auxiliary losses \cite{Liu2017}. Each method possesses advantages but can also introduce approximations and biases into the optimization pipeline. Our work builds upon recent developments showing improvements can be achieved through exact inference on implicit distributions \cite{Salimans2017, Kim2018}. By doing so, we generalize a wide class of existing algorithms under one framework allowing us to capture previously lost signal. In turn",1
"Stochastic computation graphs (SCGs) provide a formalism to represent structured optimization problems arising in artificial intelligence, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that an unbiased estimator of the gradient of the expected loss of SCGs can be derived from a single principle. However, this estimator often has high variance and requires a full model evaluation per data point, making this algorithm costly in large graphs. In this work, we address these problems by generalizing concepts from the reinforcement learning literature. We introduce the concepts of value functions, baselines and critics for arbitrary SCGs, and show how to use them to derive lower-variance gradient estimates from partial model evaluations, paving the way towards general and efficient credit assignment for gradient-based optimization. In doing so, we demonstrate how our results unify recent advances in the probabilistic inference and reinforcement learning literature.",0
"In the field of deep learning, training models can involve complex, stochastic computation graphs that make credit assignment challenging. This work presents an overview of existing methods used to assign credit during backpropagation, including popular techniques such as gradient descent, straight-through gradients, and Gumbel-softmax sampling. We discuss their strengths and limitations and explore how each technique handles noise and uncertainty inherent in stochastic computations. Our review highlights current advancements in credit assignment strategies, identifies open research questions, and proposes future directions aimed at improving model interpretability and efficiency. Ultimately, our goal is to provide insight into state-of-the-art credit assignment techniques and contribute to the development of more reliable and transparent machine learning systems.",1
"Inferring intent from observed behavior has been studied extensively within the frameworks of Bayesian inverse planning and inverse reinforcement learning. These methods infer a goal or reward function that best explains the actions of the observed agent, typically a human demonstrator. Another agent can use this inferred intent to predict, imitate, or assist the human user. However, a central assumption in inverse reinforcement learning is that the demonstrator is close to optimal. While models of suboptimal behavior exist, they typically assume that suboptimal actions are the result of some type of random noise or a known cognitive bias, like temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we take an alternative approach, and model suboptimal behavior as the result of internal model misspecification: the reason that user actions might deviate from near-optimal actions is that the user has an incorrect set of beliefs about the rules -- the dynamics -- governing how actions affect the environment. Our insight is that while demonstrated actions may be suboptimal in the real world, they may actually be near-optimal with respect to the user's internal model of the dynamics. By estimating these internal beliefs from observed behavior, we arrive at a new method for inferring intent. We demonstrate in simulation and in a user study with 12 participants that this approach enables us to more accurately model human intent, and can be used in a variety of applications, including offering assistance in a shared autonomy framework and inferring human preferences.",0
"This paper examines how human behavior can provide insight into their beliefs about complex dynamic systems. Using experimental methods, we study how individuals make decisions based on their perceived dynamics, such as causal relationships between variables or predictability of outcomes. We find that participants' decision making is often influenced by their underlying assumptions about system stability, feedback loops, and other properties of the environment. These results have implications for understanding how humans reason about uncertainty and complexity, as well as potential applications in fields such as economics, engineering, and public policy. Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering cognitive processing when analyzing behavior in uncertain environments.",1
"Data in real-world application often exhibit skewed class distribution which poses an intense challenge for machine learning. Conventional classification algorithms are not effective in the case of imbalanced data distribution, and may fail when the data distribution is highly imbalanced. To address this issue, we propose a general imbalanced classification model based on deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the classification problem as a sequential decision-making process and solve it by deep Q-learning network. The agent performs a classification action on one sample at each time step, and the environment evaluates the classification action and returns a reward to the agent. The reward from minority class sample is larger so the agent is more sensitive to the minority class. The agent finally finds an optimal classification policy in imbalanced data under the guidance of specific reward function and beneficial learning environment. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms the other imbalanced classification algorithms, and it can identify more minority samples and has great classification performance.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for imbalanced classification problems, where one class label dominates over others in terms of sample size. These types of classification tasks often exhibit poor generalization performance due to the lack of training data in minority classes, leading to high error rates. Our method uses DRL techniques to learn efficient feature representations that can improve the performance on minority classes without sacrificing majority-class accuracy. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets commonly used for imbalanced classification evaluation and show state-of-the-art results across all metrics compared to baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the interpretability and robustness of our model by analyzing the learned features and performing ablation studies. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of using DRL methods for solving real-world imbalanced classification challenges.",1
"Optimal decision making with limited or no information in stochastic environments where multiple agents interact is a challenging topic in the realm of artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular approach for arriving at optimal strategies by predicating stimuli, such as the reward for following a strategy, on experience. RL is heavily explored in the single-agent context, but is a nascent concept in multiagent problems. To this end, I propose several principled model-free and partially model-based reinforcement learning approaches for several multiagent settings. In the realm of normative reinforcement learning, I introduce scalable extensions to Monte Carlo exploring starts for partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP), dubbed MCES-P, where I expand the theory and algorithm to the multiagent setting. I first examine MCES-P with probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds in the context of multiagent setting, showing MCESP+PAC holds in the presence of other agents. I then propose a more sample-efficient methodology for antagonistic settings, MCESIP+PAC. For cooperative settings, I extend MCES-P to the Multiagent POMDP, dubbed MCESMP+PAC. I then explore the use of reinforcement learning as a methodology in searching for optima in realistic and latent model environments. First, I explore a parameterized Q-learning approach in modeling humans learning to reason in an uncertain, multiagent environment. Next, I propose an implementation of MCES-P, along with image segmentation, to create an adaptive team-based reinforcement learning technique to positively identify the presence of phenotypically-expressed water and pathogen stress in crop fields.",0
In order to better assist you write the abstract. Can you provide some context about who would read such article? Is there any specific domain where the research is applied?

"Consider mutli-goal tasks that involve static environments and dynamic goals. Examples of such tasks, such as goal-directed navigation and pick-and-place in robotics, abound. Two types of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are used for such tasks: model-free or model-based. Each of these approaches has limitations. Model-free RL struggles to transfer learned information when the goal location changes, but achieves high asymptotic accuracy in single goal tasks. Model-based RL can transfer learned information to new goal locations by retaining the explicitly learned state-dynamics, but is limited by the fact that small errors in modelling these dynamics accumulate over long-term planning. In this work, we improve upon the limitations of model-free RL in multi-goal domains. We do this by adapting the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for RL and call the adaptation Floyd-Warshall RL (FWRL). The proposed algorithm learns a goal-conditioned action-value function by constraining the value of the optimal path between any two states to be greater than or equal to the value of paths via intermediary states. Experimentally, we show that FWRL is more sample-efficient and learns higher reward strategies in multi-goal tasks as compared to Q-learning, model-based RL and other relevant baselines in a tabular domain.",0
"""Abstract"" would be okay but try not starting with it if possible (the prompt suggests that). Also do not use ""Introduction"" in the abstract either as it might confuse reviewers who look at the abstract before reading rest of the work. So how can we rephrase this?

"We propose a hybrid approach aimed at improving the sample efficiency in goal-directed reinforcement learning. We do this via a two-step mechanism where firstly, we approximate a model from Model-Free reinforcement learning. Then, we leverage this approximate model along with a notion of reachability using Mean First Passage Times to perform Model-Based reinforcement learning. Built on such a novel observation, we design two new algorithms - Mean First Passage Time based Q-Learning (MFPT-Q) and Mean First Passage Time based DYNA (MFPT-DYNA), that have been fundamentally modified from the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. Preliminary results have shown that our hybrid approaches converge with much fewer iterations than their corresponding state-of-the-art counterparts and therefore requiring much fewer samples and much fewer training trials to converge.",0
"This abstract presents novel research on improving goal-directed reinforcement learning algorithms through model characterization techniques. In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence, allowing agents to learn how to solve complex tasks using trial and error. Despite these advancements, traditional reinforcement learning methods still suffer from slow convergence rates and high sample complexity, which limits their scalability to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose the use of model characterization techniques to speed up the learning process. Our approach builds upon prior work that uses model uncertainty estimates to guide exploration, but expands upon this work by explicitly representing the agent’s beliefs about the environment dynamics through Bayesian models. We show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across a range of challenging domains, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating model characterization into goal-directed reinforcement learning. Overall, our results highlight the promise of using model representation and updating techniques to accelerate reinforcement learning while ensuring safe and robust agent behavior.",1
"Operating directly from raw high dimensional sensory inputs like images is still a challenge for robotic control. Recently, Reinforcement Learning methods have been proposed to solve specific tasks end-to-end, from pixels to torques. However, these approaches assume the access to a specified reward which may require specialized instrumentation of the environment. Furthermore, the obtained policy and representations tend to be task specific and may not transfer well. In this work we investigate completely self-supervised learning of a general image embedding and control primitives, based on finding the shortest time to reach any state. We also introduce a new structure for the state-action value function that builds a connection between model-free and model-based methods, and improves the performance of the learning algorithm. We experimentally demonstrate these findings in three simulated robotic tasks.",0

Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in several transfer learning tasks while reducing computational requirements by an order of magnitude. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different variants of the proposed model, including attention mechanisms, and show their impact on performance. Finally, we validate our embeddings through extensive human evaluation on visual search tasks.

"This work examines the role of reinforcement learning in reducing the severity of on-road collisions by controlling velocity and steering in situations in which contact is imminent. We construct a model, given camera images as input, that is capable of learning and predicting the dynamics of obstacles, cars and pedestrians, and train our policy using this model. Two policies that control both braking and steering are compared against a baseline where the only action taken is (conventional) braking in a straight line. The two policies are trained using two distinct reward structures, one where any and all collisions incur a fixed penalty, and a second one where the penalty is calculated based on already established delta-v models of injury severity. The results show that both policies exceed the performance of the baseline, with the policy trained using injury models having the highest performance.",0
"In recent years, imminent collision mitigation has become increasingly important due to advancements in autonomous vehicles and other safety systems. Existing approaches rely heavily on sensors such as radar and lidar to detect potential collisions and take action accordingly. While these methods have proven effective, they can still suffer from limitations related to sensor accuracy, range, and environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose using reinforcement learning (RL) in conjunction with vision algorithms to improve the reliability and effectiveness of imminent collision detection and prevention systems. Our approach leverages large amounts of data collected from real driving scenarios to train deep neural networks that learn to recognize patterns associated with impending collisions. By combining RL with computer vision techniques, our system is able to make predictions based on both visual cues and learned behaviors. We evaluate our method through extensive simulations and real world experiments, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of precision and reaction time. Ultimately, our work represents a step forward towards safer and more efficient transportation systems with reduced human involvement.",1
"This study proposes a framework for human-like autonomous car-following planning based on deep reinforcement learning (deep RL). Historical driving data are fed into a simulation environment where an RL agent learns from trial and error interactions based on a reward function that signals how much the agent deviates from the empirical data. Through these interactions, an optimal policy, or car-following model that maps in a human-like way from speed, relative speed between a lead and following vehicle, and inter-vehicle spacing to acceleration of a following vehicle is finally obtained. The model can be continuously updated when more data are fed in. Two thousand car-following periods extracted from the 2015 Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study were used to train the model and compare its performance with that of traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. As shown by this study results, a deep deterministic policy gradient car-following model that uses disparity between simulated and observed speed as the reward function and considers a reaction delay of 1s, denoted as DDPGvRT, can reproduce human-like car-following behavior with higher accuracy than traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. Specifically, the DDPGvRT model has a spacing validation error of 18% and speed validation error of 5%, which are less than those of other models, including the intelligent driver model, models based on locally weighted regression, and conventional neural network-based models. Moreover, the DDPGvRT demonstrates good capability of generalization to various driving situations and can adapt to different drivers by continuously learning. This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning methodology can offer insight into driver behavior and can contribute to the development of human-like autonomous driving algorithms and traffic-flow models.",0
"In recent years, autonomous car technology has made significant progress towards achieving full autonomy.

"To act and plan in complex environments, we posit that agents should have a mental simulator of the world with three characteristics: (a) it should build an abstract state representing the condition of the world; (b) it should form a belief which represents uncertainty on the world; (c) it should go beyond simple step-by-step simulation, and exhibit temporal abstraction. Motivated by the absence of a model satisfying all these requirements, we propose TD-VAE, a generative sequence model that learns representations containing explicit beliefs about states several steps into the future, and that can be rolled out directly without single-step transitions. TD-VAE is trained on pairs of temporally separated time points, using an analogue of temporal difference learning used in reinforcement learning.",0
"Abstract:  Deep learning has revolutionized many fields by enabling data-driven solutions that were previously impractical due to computational demands. However, these models often suffer from a lack of robustness since they require large amounts of labeled training examples. In addition, current techniques struggle to find high-quality latent representations without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose using temporal difference variational autoencoders (TDVAE). TDVAEs combine a deep generative model with ideas from reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning. They incorporate temporal difference error backpropagation into the VAE framework, which allows them to learn more efficiently from smaller datasets than competing methods. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks and show that TDVAEs significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining deep generative models and temporal difference learning for improving robustness and quality of learned representations while maintaining comparable reconstruction performance.",1
"Although end-to-end (E2E) learning has led to impressive progress on a variety of visual understanding tasks, it is often impeded by hardware constraints (e.g., GPU memory) and is prone to overfitting. When it comes to video captioning, one of the most challenging benchmark tasks in computer vision, those limitations of E2E learning are especially amplified by the fact that both the input videos and output captions are lengthy sequences. Indeed, state-of-the-art methods for video captioning process video frames by convolutional neural networks and generate captions by unrolling recurrent neural networks. If we connect them in an E2E manner, the resulting model is both memory-consuming and data-hungry, making it extremely hard to train. In this paper, we propose a multitask reinforcement learning approach to training an E2E video captioning model. The main idea is to mine and construct as many effective tasks (e.g., attributes, rewards, and the captions) as possible from the human captioned videos such that they can jointly regulate the search space of the E2E neural network, from which an E2E video captioning model can be found and generalized to the testing phase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video captioning model that is trained end-to-end from the raw video input to the caption output. Experimental results show that such a model outperforms existing ones to a large margin on two benchmark video captioning datasets.",0

"Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) requires a large number of trials to learn a good policy, especially in environments with sparse rewards. We explore a method to improve the sample efficiency when we have access to demonstrations. Our approach, Backplay, uses a single demonstration to construct a curriculum for a given task. Rather than starting each training episode in the environment's fixed initial state, we start the agent near the end of the demonstration and move the starting point backwards during the course of training until we reach the initial state. Our contributions are that we analytically characterize the types of environments where Backplay can improve training speed, demonstrate the effectiveness of Backplay both in large grid worlds and a complex four player zero-sum game (Pommerman), and show that Backplay compares favorably to other competitive methods known to improve sample efficiency. This includes reward shaping, behavioral cloning, and reverse curriculum generation.",0
"This is a short summary of some of the key points raised by the author on the topic of Backplay: “One must always turn back”. The article discusses the importance of reflecting on past experiences and using them as learning opportunities to improve one’s future actions. This concept is explored through the lens of existentialist philosophy, which emphasizes personal responsibility for one’s own life and choices. Sartre argues that individuals have the freedom to choose their path but are ultimately responsible for the consequences of those decisions. Thus, turning backward can allow us to acknowledge our mistakes and make better decisions moving forward. Additionally, Heidegger believes that we often don’t fully comprehend the meaning behind things until after they have passed. Therefore, reconsideration of past events is necessary to gain deeper insight into ourselves and the world around us. Ultimately, the article suggests that embracing reflection as part of everyday experience enables us to live more thoughtfully and authentically.",1
"Deploying the idea of long-term cumulative return, reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in various fields. We propose a formulation of the landmark localization in 3D medical images as a reinforcement learning problem. Whereas value-based methods have been widely used to solve similar problems, we adopt an actor-critic based direct policy search method framed in a temporal difference learning approach. Successful behavior learning is challenging in large state and/or action spaces, requiring many trials. We introduce a partial policy-based reinforcement learning to enable solving the large problem of localization by learning the optimal policy on smaller partial domains. Independent actors efficiently learn the corresponding partial policies, each utilizing their own independent critic. The proposed policy reconstruction from the partial policies ensures a robust and efficient localization utilizing the sub-agents solving simple binary decision problems in their corresponding partial action spaces. The proposed reinforcement learning requires a small number of trials to learn the optimal behavior compared with the original behavior learning scheme.",0
"""Partial Policy-based Reinforcement Learning for Anatomical Landmark Localization in 3D Medical Images"" presents a new approach to localizing anatomical landmarks on medical images using reinforcement learning (RL) with partial policies. While existing RL methods learn full action policies that specify the exact location of the next landmark, our method learns suboptimal but more interpretable partial policies that take into account both image features and spatial relationships among nearby landmarks. These partial policies constrain the search space by allowing different levels of guidance, resulting in improved accuracy and interpretability compared to previous RL approaches. Our experiments on 2D mammograms demonstrate that our method achieves better FROC performance than baseline methods across various amounts of training data, making it a promising tool for automatic anatomical landmark detection. In addition, we show that our partial policy framework can capture important domain knowledge related to human annotation strategies while reducing computational cost.

"In this paper we present a novel geometric framework that enables deep reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal multi-model fits directly from data streams, without requiring any prior knowledge of the models or their parameters.

"We address the problem of person re-identification from commodity depth sensors. One challenge for depth-based recognition is data scarcity. Our first contribution addresses this problem by introducing split-rate RGB-to-Depth transfer, which leverages large RGB datasets more effectively than popular fine-tuning approaches. Our transfer scheme is based on the observation that the model parameters at the bottom layers of a deep convolutional neural network can be directly shared between RGB and depth data while the remaining layers need to be fine-tuned rapidly. Our second contribution enhances re-identification for video by implementing temporal attention as a Bernoulli-Sigmoid unit acting upon frame-level features. Since this unit is stochastic, the temporal attention parameters are trained using reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the accuracy of our method in person re-identification from depth sequences. Finally, in a scenario where subjects wear unseen clothes, we show large performance gains compared to a state-of-the-art model which relies on RGB data.",0

"We propose a general formulation for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) problems in settings with observational data. That is, we consider the problem of learning good policies solely from historical data in which unobserved factors (confounders) affect both observed actions and rewards. Our formulation allows us to extend a representative RL algorithm, the Actor-Critic method, to its deconfounding variant, with the methodology for this extension being easily applied to other RL algorithms. In addition to this, we develop a new benchmark for evaluating deconfounding RL algorithms by modifying the OpenAI Gym environments and the MNIST dataset. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are superior to traditional RL methods in confounded environments with observational data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that confounders are taken into consideration for addressing full RL problems with observational data.

Extensive experiments on benchmark RL environments demonstrate that our method significantly improves accuracy over state-of-the-art baseline methods across a wide range of domains. The results have important implications for applying RL in real-world scenarios where unobserved factors may influence decision making.",1
"Solving tasks in Reinforcement Learning is no easy feat. As the goal of the agent is to maximize the accumulated reward, it often learns to exploit loopholes and misspecifications in the reward signal resulting in unwanted behavior. While constraints may solve this issue, there is no closed form solution for general constraints. In this work we present a novel multi-timescale approach for constrained policy optimization, called `Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO), which uses an alternative penalty signal to guide the policy towards a constraint satisfying one. We prove the convergence of our approach and provide empirical evidence of its ability to train constraint satisfying policies.",0
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the development of increasingly complex models that can perform tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and game playing at superhuman levels. One challenge faced by these models is the need for efficient exploration, which involves finding effective policies without incurring large amounts of risk or taking excessive time. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Reward Constrained Policy Optimization (RCPO), which addresses this issue by balancing the desire for high reward against constraints on resource usage. Our approach uses a customized trust region method to optimize a policy within a constrained action space, allowing for safe and efficient exploration even in domains with unknown dynamics or uncertain rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a range of experiments across different task environments, showing that RCPO significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both efficiency and performance metrics. These results highlight the potential benefits of using constrained optimization techniques in reinforcement learning, paving the way for further research into more sophisticated exploration strategies.",1

"We propose a method to efficiently learn diverse strategies in reinforcement learning for query reformulation in the tasks of document retrieval and question answering. In the proposed framework an agent consists of multiple specialized sub-agents and a meta-agent that learns to aggregate the answers from sub-agents to produce a final answer. Sub-agents are trained on disjoint partitions of the training data, while the meta-agent is trained on the full training set. Our method makes learning faster, because it is highly parallelizable, and has better generalization performance than strong baselines, such as an ensemble of agents trained on the full data. We show that the improved performance is due to the increased diversity of reformulation strategies.",0
"This research focuses on the problem of coordinating multiple reinforcement learning agents for diverse query reformulation (MQR). We propose that coordination can enable MQR to learn better policy by enabling agents to share knowledge, adaptively explore different policies, exploit successful exploration strategies, and mitigate negative effects such as competition for resources. Our approach consists of three components: a multi-agent environment simulation toolkit, a novel agent architecture combining deep Q-learning and Monte Carlo tree search, and a distributed actor-critic training algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms individual RL approaches significantly across multiple domains including StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, Atari games, and continuous control problems. Additionally, we provide further analysis demonstrating improved stability and robustness compared to prior methods. Finally, we discuss future directions and potential applications of our work in areas such as human-AI collaboration and adaptive education systems. This paper presents an innovative solution to the challenge of coordinating multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents for diverse query reformulation (MQR).

"Recent breakthroughs in Go play and strategic games have witnessed the great potential of reinforcement learning in intelligently scheduling in uncertain environment, but some bottlenecks are also encountered when we generalize this paradigm to universal complex tasks. Among them, the low efficiency of data utilization in model-free reinforcement algorithms is of great concern. In contrast, the model-based reinforcement learning algorithms can reveal underlying dynamics in learning environments and seldom suffer the data utilization problem. To address the problem, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm with attention mechanism embedded is proposed as an extension of World Models in this paper. We learn the environment model through Mixture Density Network Recurrent Network(MDN-RNN) for agents to interact, with combinations of variational auto-encoder(VAE) and attention incorporated in state value estimates during the process of learning policy. In this way, agent can learn optimal policies through less interactions with actual environment, and final experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in control problem.",0
"Abstract: In this work we propose VMAV-C (Value Matching Actor-critic Value-function Based on Contrastive learning), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm designed specifically for model-free control tasks. Our approach combines elements from both Q-learning and policy gradient methods while addressing some of their limitations. We introduce two key innovations: Firstly, rather than using a separate value function for evaluation, our method uses a contrastive approach that learns to match states visited by the agent against a target distribution representing states achieved through successful executions of the task. Secondly, instead of directly optimizing the actor update, our method derives a pseudo-derivative of the critic value as if it were the true policy’s state-value function which allows us to learn faster without overshooting. Extensive experiments across a variety of continuous control benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms existing algorithms while maintaining stability under large step sizes. This suggests that VMAV-C can effectively balance exploitation and exploration while leveraging strong generalization performance compared to traditional model-based approaches.",1
"Reinforcement learning agents need exploratory behaviors to escape from local optima. These behaviors may include both immediate dithering perturbation and temporally consistent exploration. To achieve these, a stochastic policy model that is inherently consistent through a period of time is in desire, especially for tasks with either sparse rewards or long term information. In this work, we introduce a novel on-policy temporally consistent exploration strategy - Neural Adaptive Dropout Policy Exploration (NADPEx) - for deep reinforcement learning agents. Modeled as a global random variable for conditional distribution, dropout is incorporated to reinforcement learning policies, equipping them with inherent temporal consistency, even when the reward signals are sparse. Two factors, gradients' alignment with the objective and KL constraint in policy space, are discussed to guarantee NADPEx policy's stable improvement. Our experiments demonstrate that NADPEx solves tasks with sparse reward while naive exploration and parameter noise fail. It yields as well or even faster convergence in the standard mujoco benchmark for continuous control.",0
"In recent years, off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods have become popular due to their sample efficiency and ease of implementation. However, they suffer from high variance due to estimating the value function using the policy being learned. This can result in unstable training and suboptimal performance. On-policy TD methods, while more stable and less prone to overestimation, often use the current policy to approximate the target policy, resulting in inconsistent estimates over time. Here we propose a new on-policy TD algorithm that combines off-policy evaluation techniques with on-policy updates, termed NadpEx. Our approach uses the importance sampling ratio as a replay buffer item and normalizes the temporal differences using the advantage estimate. We show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple continuous control tasks while reducing the computational cost compared to prior state-of-the-art algorithms.",1
"We propose a new sample-efficient methodology, called Supervised Policy Update (SPU), for deep reinforcement learning. Starting with data generated by the current policy, SPU formulates and solves a constrained optimization problem in the non-parameterized proximal policy space. Using supervised regression, it then converts the optimal non-parameterized policy to a parameterized policy, from which it draws new samples. The methodology is general in that it applies to both discrete and continuous action spaces, and can handle a wide variety of proximity constraints for the non-parameterized optimization problem. We show how the Natural Policy Gradient and Trust Region Policy Optimization (NPG/TRPO) problems, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) problem can be addressed by this methodology. The SPU implementation is much simpler than TRPO. In terms of sample efficiency, our extensive experiments show SPU outperforms TRPO in Mujoco simulated robotic tasks and outperforms PPO in Atari video game tasks.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), deep neural networks have shown promise as powerful function approximators that can learn complex policies directly from high dimensional sensory inputs such as images. However, they require large amounts of training data to perform well. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms trained on labeled datasets achieve better performance but lack generality because their solutions depend heavily on specific features present in the dataset which may not be relevant elsewhere. This paper describes a method that combines supervision and reinforcement by using small labeled subtasks to regularize the policy updates obtained during RL training. By utilizing both types of signals simultaneously we obtain more efficient training and better final performance than either approach alone. Our method improves existing work by proposing new architectures, loss functions, initialization strategies, and update rules specifically designed for our framework. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm across several Atari games achieving state-of-the art results while requiring significantly less data.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has achieved superior performance in complex sequential tasks by learning directly from image input. A deep neural network is used as a function approximator and requires no specific state information. However, one drawback of using only images as input is that this approach requires a prohibitively large amount of training time and data for the model to learn the state feature representation and approach reasonable performance. This is not feasible in real-world applications, especially when the data are expansive and training phase could introduce disasters that affect human safety. In this work, we use a human demonstration approach to speed up training for learning features and use the resulting pre-trained model to replace the neural network in the deep RL Deep Q-Network (DQN), followed by human interaction to further refine the model. We empirically evaluate our approach by using only a human demonstration model and modified DQN with human demonstration model included in the Microsoft AirSim car simulator. Our results show that (1) pre-training with human demonstration in a supervised learning approach is better and much faster at discovering features than DQN alone, (2) initializing the DQN with a pre-trained model provides a significant improvement in training time and performance even with limited human demonstration, and (3) providing the ability for humans to supply suggestions during DQN training can speed up the network's convergence on an optimal policy, as well as allow it to learn more complex policies that are harder to discover by random exploration.",0
In this paper we present a novel methodology for applying machine learning algorithms to autonomous vehicles using parallel computing techniques. We begin by describing the challenges that must be overcome in order to apply such technologies to safety critical systems like self driving cars. We then introduce our approach which uses distributed computation across multiple CPUs to speed up training and testing of different models. Our results show significant improvements over traditional sequential methods both in terms of speedup and quality of predictions. Lastly we discuss potential future applications of this research beyond just autonomous vehicle control.,1
"We consider a framework involving behavioral economics and machine learning. Rationally inattentive Bayesian agents make decisions based on their posterior distribution, utility function and information acquisition cost Renyi divergence which generalizes Shannon mutual information). By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent's attention strategy. Then we present a preference based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to test for rational inattention: is the agent an utility maximizer, attention maximizer, and does an information cost function exist that rationalizes the data? The test imposes a Renyi mutual information constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. The test provides constructive estimates of the utility function and information acquisition cost of the agent. We illustrate these methods on a massive YouTube dataset for characterizing the commenting behavior of users.",0
"This study examines how estimations can help improve user engagement on video sharing platforms like YouTube by clustering similar users together into groups and determining their preferences through rationally inattentive utility functions (RIUF). By applying deep learning techniques such as neural networks, researchers were able to model user behavior in terms of clicking, liking, commenting, subscribing, and other forms of interaction within videos and channels. Results showed that framing effects play a significant role in shaping viewers’ perception of content quality, and using clustered estimates of RIUF improved predictions of which videos would lead to higher levels of engagement. Overall, these findings have important implications for understanding consumer decision making processes and improving online experiences for millions of internet users across the globe.

"Learning in environments with large state and action spaces, and sparse rewards, can hinder a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent's learning through trial-and-error. For instance, following natural language instructions on the Web (such as booking a flight ticket) leads to RL settings where input vocabulary and number of actionable elements on a page can grow very large. Even though recent approaches improve the success rate on relatively simple environments with the help of human demonstrations to guide the exploration, they still fail in environments where the set of possible instructions can reach millions. We approach the aforementioned problems from a different perspective and propose guided RL approaches that can generate unbounded amount of experience for an agent to learn from. Instead of learning from a complicated instruction with a large vocabulary, we decompose it into multiple sub-instructions and schedule a curriculum in which an agent is tasked with a gradually increasing subset of these relatively easier sub-instructions. In addition, when the expert demonstrations are not available, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that generates new instruction following tasks and trains the agent more effectively. We train DQN, deep reinforcement learning agent, with Q-value function approximated with a novel QWeb neural network architecture on these smaller, synthetic instructions. We evaluate the ability of our agent to generalize to new instructions on World of Bits benchmark, on forms with up to 100 elements, supporting 14 million possible instructions. The QWeb agent outperforms the baseline without using any human demonstration achieving 100% success rate on several difficult environments.",0

"Credit assignment in Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) is still poorly understood. Existing methods either neglect credit assignment to pre-adaptation behavior or implement it naively. This leads to poor sample-efficiency during meta-training as well as ineffective task identification strategies. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of credit assignment in gradient-based Meta-RL. Building on the gained insights we develop a novel meta-learning algorithm that overcomes both the issue of poor credit assignment and previous difficulties in estimating meta-policy gradients. By controlling the statistical distance of both pre-adaptation and adapted policies during meta-policy search, the proposed algorithm endows efficient and stable meta-learning. Our approach leads to superior pre-adaptation policy behavior and consistently outperforms previous Meta-RL algorithms in sample-efficiency, wall-clock time, and asymptotic performance.",0
"In this paper, we describe ProMP (Proximal Meta-Policy Search), a novel meta-learning method that enables rapid fine-tuning on a wide range of reinforcement learning tasks.

This allows us to efficiently optimize policy parameters while significantly reducing computation cost. We present extensive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse domains, including continuous control tasks and discrete games. Overall, we show that ProMP outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning methods and achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific agents trained without any prior knowledge.",1
"This paper proposes an efficient neural network (NN) architecture design methodology called Chameleon that honors given resource constraints. Instead of developing new building blocks or using computationally-intensive reinforcement learning algorithms, our approach leverages existing efficient network building blocks and focuses on exploiting hardware traits and adapting computation resources to fit target latency and/or energy constraints. We formulate platform-aware NN architecture search in an optimization framework and propose a novel algorithm to search for optimal architectures aided by efficient accuracy and resource (latency and/or energy) predictors. At the core of our algorithm lies an accuracy predictor built atop Gaussian Process with Bayesian optimization for iterative sampling. With a one-time building cost for the predictors, our algorithm produces state-of-the-art model architectures on different platforms under given constraints in just minutes. Our results show that adapting computation resources to building blocks is critical to model performance. Without the addition of any bells and whistles, our models achieve significant accuracy improvements against state-of-the-art hand-crafted and automatically designed architectures. We achieve 73.8% and 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at 20ms latency on a mobile CPU and DSP. At reduced latency, our models achieve up to 8.5% (4.8%) and 6.6% (9.3%) absolute top-1 accuracy improvements compared to MobileNetV2 and MnasNet, respectively, on a mobile CPU (DSP), and 2.7% (4.6%) and 5.6% (2.6%) accuracy gains over ResNet-101 and ResNet-152, respectively, on an Nvidia GPU (Intel CPU).",0

By incorporating key platform characteristics such as memory footprint, latency, and compute constraints into model adaptation, ChamNet represents a significant step forward in enabling automated neural architecture design for real-world deployment scenarios.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has achieved superior performance in complex sequential tasks by using deep neural networks as function approximators to learn directly from raw input images. However, learning directly from raw images is data inefficient. The agent must learn feature representation of complex states in addition to learning a policy. As a result, deep RL typically suffers from slow learning speeds and often requires a prohibitively large amount of training time and data to reach reasonable performance, making it inapplicable to real-world settings where data is expensive. In this work, we improve data efficiency in deep RL by addressing one of the two learning goals, feature learning. We leverage supervised learning to pre-train on a small set of non-expert human demonstrations and empirically evaluate our approach using the asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithms (A3C) in the Atari domain. Our results show significant improvements in learning speed, even when the provided demonstration is noisy and of low quality.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex sequential decision tasks across multiple domains such as gaming, robotics, and navigation. However, training high-performance RL agents remains challenging due to their reliance on large amounts of trial-and-error data collection and computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a novel methodology that leverages non-expert human demonstrations for pre-training the value function of deep RL agents. Our method adapts natural evolution strategies (NES), which uses an iterative optimization process guided by a surrogate model trained from human trajectories, thus enabling both efficient exploration and exploitation during agent improvement. We empirically validate our method through extensive experiments in continuous control benchmark tasks, where we show significant performance improvements over strong baseline algorithms that lack pre-training. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating human knowledge into deep RL systems to accelerate training and enhance overall task performance. This study contributes to the broader conversation on how humans can collaborate with artificial intelligence towards effective problem-solving in complex environments.",1
"Existing methods for interactive image retrieval have demonstrated the merit of integrating user feedback, improving retrieval results. However, most current systems rely on restricted forms of user feedback, such as binary relevance responses, or feedback based on a fixed set of relative attributes, which limits their impact. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to interactive image search that enables users to provide feedback via natural language, allowing for more natural and effective interaction. We formulate the task of dialog-based interactive image retrieval as a reinforcement learning problem, and reward the dialog system for improving the rank of the target image during each dialog turn. To mitigate the cumbersome and costly process of collecting human-machine conversations as the dialog system learns, we train our system with a user simulator, which is itself trained to describe the differences between target and candidate images. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated in a footwear retrieval application. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that 1) our proposed learning framework achieves better accuracy than other supervised and reinforcement learning baselines and 2) user feedback based on natural language rather than pre-specified attributes leads to more effective retrieval results, and a more natural and expressive communication interface.",0
"Title: Dialog-based Interactive Image Retrieval Abstract: Image retrieval systems have traditionally relied on textual queries such as keywords or descriptions provided by users. However, these methods can often lead to poor results due to difficulties in accurately describing images through language. In contrast, interactive image retrieval (IIR) allows users to provide feedback on retrieved images in order to refine search results and improve accuracy. This paper presents a novel approach to IIR that utilizes natural language dialogs between users and computers to facilitate more accurate image retrieval. We propose using conversational agents, trained on large amounts of image data, to engage in open-ended conversation with users and gradually narrow down their desired search results. Our method takes advantage of recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing techniques to enable effective communication between humans and machines. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system compared to state-of-the-art IIR approaches. Overall, we believe that dialog-based IIR has significant potential to revolutionize the field and improve user satisfaction with image retrieval services.",1
"The ability of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn about many reward functions at the same time has many potential benefits, such as the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler ones, the exchange of information between tasks, and the reuse of skills. We focus on one aspect in particular, namely the ability to generalise to unseen tasks. Parametric generalisation relies on the interpolation power of a function approximator that is given the task description as input; one of its most common form are universal value function approximators (UVFAs). Another way to generalise to new tasks is to exploit structure in the RL problem itself. Generalised policy improvement (GPI) combines solutions of previous tasks into a policy for the unseen task; this relies on instantaneous policy evaluation of old policies under the new reward function, which is made possible through successor features (SFs). Our proposed universal successor features approximators (USFAs) combine the advantages of all of these, namely the scalability of UVFAs, the instant inference of SFs, and the strong generalisation of GPI. We discuss the challenges involved in training a USFA, its generalisation properties and demonstrate its practical benefits and transfer abilities on a large-scale domain in which the agent has to navigate in a first-person perspective three-dimensional environment.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to feature approximations that can handle arbitrary distributions over continuous features without any distributional assumptions or discretization methods. Our method combines universal function approximators such as neural networks with powerful nonlinear optimization techniques from reinforcement learning theory to generate accurate predictions on complex datasets even if the underlying data generation process is unknown. We evaluate our model on several benchmark tasks and compare it with state-of-the art models and show that our method outperforms them significantly while providing interpretable results. Finally we demonstrate how these ideas can be extended to deep generative models leading to further improvements in both quantitative performance and interpretability. Overall, our work opens up a promising direction for building flexible prediction engines that can learn complex functions from raw input data without relying on handcrafted domain knowledge or problem specific heuristics.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning agents have recently been successful across a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks; however, they can be slow to train and require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn a suitable policy. This is borne out by the fact that a reinforcement learning agent has no prior knowledge of the world, no pre-existing data to depend on and so must devote considerable time to exploration. Transfer learning can alleviate some of the problems by leveraging learning done on some source task to help learning on some target task. Our work presents an algorithm for initialising the hidden feature representation of the target task. We propose a domain adaptation method to transfer state representations and demonstrate transfer across domains, tasks and action spaces. We utilise adversarial domain adaptation ideas combined with an adversarial autoencoder architecture. We align our new policies' representation space with a pre-trained source policy, taking target task data generated from a random policy. We demonstrate that this initialisation step provides significant improvement when learning a new reinforcement learning task, which highlights the wide applicability of adversarial adaptation methods; even as the task and label/action space also changes.",0
"Abstract: Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been designed to learn from very large amounts of data, but these methods can be difficult to apply in real-world settings where the amount of available data may be limited. In order to address this issue, we propose a novel approach to domain adaptation that allows reinforcement learning agents to transfer knowledge gained from one task to another related task in which there is less available training data. Our method uses several techniques to improve the performance of the agent, including pre-training on a similar task, fine-tuning using target domain data, and regularization to prevent overfitting. We evaluate our approach on several tasks within the Atari game suite and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across all domains tested, achieving human-level or better performance on most tasks. These results suggest that our proposed approach has significant potential for improving the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning in real-world applications where data may be scarce.",1
"Gradient-based meta-learners such as MAML are able to learn a meta-prior from similar tasks to adapt to novel tasks from the same distribution with few gradient updates. One important limitation of such frameworks is that they seek a common initialization shared across the entire task distribution, substantially limiting the diversity of the task distributions that they are able to learn from. In this paper, we augment MAML with the capability to identify tasks sampled from a multimodal task distribution and adapt quickly through gradient updates. Specifically, we propose a multimodal MAML algorithm that is able to modulate its meta-learned prior according to the identified task, allowing faster adaptation. We evaluate the proposed model on a diverse set of problems including regression, few-shot image classification, and reinforcement learning. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in modulating the meta-learned prior in response to the characteristics of tasks sampled from a multimodal distribution.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in a wide range of tasks across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One key factor contributing to these successes has been the development of meta-learning algorithms that enable models to learn from few training examples by leveraging prior knowledge gained through experience on similar tasks. Despite their effectiveness, existing meta-learning methods often require task-specific modifications or handcrafted features, which limits their applicability to new domains and modalities. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework capable of learning from diverse forms of data representation, thereby enabling efficient fine-tuning over many different types of datasets without requiring any changes to the base algorithm. Our approach builds upon recent advances in model-agnostic optimization techniques, using gradient-based updates and stochastic gradient descent to iteratively improve performance on held-out validation sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology on several benchmark datasets spanning image classification, text generation, and human pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results across all three modalities while outperforming previous MAML approaches in some cases. Overall, our research highlights the promise of multimodal model-agnostic meta-learning as a powerful tool for tackling emerging challenges in artificial intelligence where data heterogeneity and complexity necessitate adaptive solutions with minimal supervision.",1

"Mobile edge computing (MEC) emerges recently as a promising solution to relieve resource-limited mobile devices from computation-intensive tasks, which enables devices to offload workloads to nearby MEC servers and improve the quality of computation experience. Nevertheless, by considering a MEC system consisting of multiple mobile users with stochastic task arrivals and wireless channels in this paper, the design of computation offloading policies is challenging to minimize the long-term average computation cost in terms of power consumption and buffering delay. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategy is investigated to build a scalable MEC system with limited feedback. Specifically, a continuous action space-based DRL approach named deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is adopted to learn efficient computation offloading policies independently at each mobile user. Thus, powers of both local execution and task offloading can be adaptively allocated by the learned policies from each user's local observation of the MEC system. Numerical results are illustrated to demonstrate that efficient policies can be learned at each user, and performance of the proposed DDPG based decentralized strategy outperforms the conventional deep Q-network (DQN) based discrete power control strategy and some other greedy strategies with reduced computation cost. Besides, the power-delay tradeoff is also analyzed for both the DDPG based and DQN based strategies.",0
"Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology that allows mobile devices to offload their computation tasks to nearby edge servers instead of relying on distant clouds. However, managing the task allocation among multiple users can become challenging, especially with limited resources available at each server. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized approach using deep reinforcement learning to maximize system utility while ensuring fairness in resource distribution. We model this problem as a multi-agent cooperative game where agents aim to make decisions based on mutual benefits rather than individual interests. Each agent learns its policy through deep reinforcement learning by interacting with other agents in the environment. Our evaluation shows that our proposed method outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of overall efficiency, latency reduction, and user satisfaction. Moreover, we demonstrate that our scheme effectively balances system performance and user experience under diverse network conditions.

"Proximal policy optimization(PPO) has been proposed as a first-order optimization method for reinforcement learning. We should notice that an exterior penalty method is used in it. Often, the minimizers of the exterior penalty functions approach feasibility only in the limits as the penalty parameter grows increasingly large. Therefore, it may result in the low level of sampling efficiency. This method, which we call proximal policy optimization with barrier method (PPO-B), keeps almost all advantageous spheres of PPO such as easy implementation and good generalization. Specifically, a new surrogate objective with interior penalty method is proposed to avoid the defect arose from exterior penalty method. Conclusions can be draw that PPO-B is able to outperform PPO in terms of sampling efficiency since PPO-B achieved clearly better performance on Atari and Mujoco environment than PPO.",0

This method uses logarithmic barriers as a technique to improve stability during training and reduce oscillations. The results show that the new method leads to faster convergence and better performance compared to standard PPO. Furthermore, extensive experiments were conducted using different types of environments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Overall, the study provides a valuable contribution to reinforcement learning research by presenting a novel algorithm for improving policy optimization methods.",1
"We consider a team of reinforcement learning agents that concurrently operate in a common environment, and we develop an approach to efficient coordinated exploration that is suitable for problems of practical scale. Our approach builds on seed sampling (Dimakopoulou and Van Roy, 2018) and randomized value function learning (Osband et al., 2016). We demonstrate that, for simple tabular contexts, the approach is competitive with previously proposed tabular model learning methods (Dimakopoulou and Van Roy, 2018). With a higher-dimensional problem and a neural network value function representation, the approach learns quickly with far fewer agents than alternative exploration schemes.",0
"In recent years, coordinated multi-agent systems have been gaining increasing attention due to their ability to solve complex tasks that cannot be achieved by single agents alone. One key challenge in such settings is how to enable efficient exploration among multiple learning agents. This problem becomes even more difficult as the number of agents increases, since each agent must balance between exploiting their current knowledge and actively seeking new information about the environment. In this work, we propose a novel method called ""Scalable Coordinated Exploration"" (SCE) which addresses these issues through carefully designed coordination mechanisms. Our approach utilizes a shared set of experiences for all agents while allowing them to make decisions based on local observations. By using Thompson Sampling, our agents can explore effectively while still maintaining competitive performance with respect to non-exploratory methods. We evaluate our algorithm across several benchmark environments with varying numbers of agents, demonstrating that SCE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both convergence speed and final performance. Overall, our results showcase the effectiveness of SCE in enabling scalable and coordinated exploration in concurrent reinforcement learning scenarios.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown tremendous success in solving several games and tasks in robotics. However, unlike humans, it generally requires a lot of training instances. Trajectories imitating to solve the task at hand can help to increase sample-efficiency of deep RL methods. In this paper, we present a simple approach to use such trajectories, applied to the challenging Ball-in-Maze Games, recently introduced in the literature. We show that in spite of not using human-generated trajectories and just using the simulator as a model to generate a limited number of trajectories, we can get a speed-up of about 2-3x in the learning process. We also discuss some challenges we observed while using trajectory-based learning for very sparse reward functions.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful technique for solving complex tasks such as game playing. However, traditional methods often suffer from high sample complexity, which limits their applicability in practice. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called trajectory-based learning (TBL) that leverages trajectories obtained by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach builds upon a recently introduced algorithm based on Thompson sampling but replaces randomized actions with the ones selected by MCTS. We show that our proposed TBL significantly outperforms both Thompson sampling and existing policy gradient techniques while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms across a wide range of Atari games. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining classical planning algorithms like MCTS with model-free RL techniques.",1
"In an increasing number of domains it has been demonstrated that deep learning models can be trained using relatively large batch sizes without sacrificing data efficiency. However the limits of this massive data parallelism seem to differ from domain to domain, ranging from batches of tens of thousands in ImageNet to batches of millions in RL agents that play the game Dota 2. To our knowledge there is limited conceptual understanding of why these limits to batch size differ or how we might choose the correct batch size in a new domain. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple and easy-to-measure statistic called the gradient noise scale predicts the largest useful batch size across many domains and applications, including a number of supervised learning datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Billion Word), reinforcement learning domains (Atari and Dota), and even generative model training (autoencoders on SVHN). We find that the noise scale increases as the loss decreases over a training run and depends on the model size primarily through improved model performance. Our empirically-motivated theory also describes the tradeoff between compute-efficiency and time-efficiency, and provides a rough model of the benefits of adaptive batch-size training.",0
"Title: An Empirical Investigation into Large-Batch Training Abstract: This study examines the impact of large-batch training on neural network performance and optimization dynamics. We conduct comprehensive experiments using state-of-the-art models across multiple tasks and datasets to provide insights into key factors that influence the effectiveness of large-batch training. Our results show that large batch sizes can lead to faster convergence, improved generalization accuracy, and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. However, we find that these benefits come at the cost of increased model uncertainty, higher memory usage, and diminishing returns as batch size increases beyond certain thresholds. By shedding light on the tradeoffs associated with large-batch training, our work provides empirical guidance for practitioners seeking to optimize their deep learning pipelines.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) research has grown significantly in recent years. A number of software offerings now exist that provide stable, comprehensive implementations for benchmarking. At the same time, recent deep RL research has become more diverse in its goals. In this paper we introduce Dopamine, a new research framework for deep RL that aims to support some of that diversity. Dopamine is open-source, TensorFlow-based, and provides compact and reliable implementations of some state-of-the-art deep RL agents. We complement this offering with a taxonomy of the different research objectives in deep RL research. While by no means exhaustive, our analysis highlights the heterogeneity of research in the field, and the value of frameworks such as ours.",0
"""Dopamine: A research framework for deep reinforcement learning provides a comprehensive overview of dopamine as a computational model of reward prediction error signals within deep neural networks (DNNs). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning methods, to decision making under uncertainty tasks such as control, robotics, and natural language processing. However, traditional reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from slow convergence rates and sample complexity issues due to limited function approximators and lack of flexibility in adapting to complex environments. The dopamine algorithm addresses these limitations by utilizing a DNN architecture that generates action values based on both state features and predicted errors. This architecture integrates multiple sources of feedback such as rewards, penalties, and terminal states into a single model. By leveraging both positive and negative predictions of value, the agent can learn more efficiently and effectively while maintaining stability during exploration phases. In addition, we propose several improvements including shaping bonuses, clipped double Q-learning, and dueling network architectures for estimating state value functions. These modifications further enhance performance in challenging continuous control domains and make dopamine applicable across a wide range of applications. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of dopamine compared to other state-of-the-art RL approaches and provide insights into understanding key design principles underlying efficient learning and adaptation."" ""This paper presents Dopamine, a research framework for deep reinforcement learning, which uses a DNN architecture to generate action values based on both state features and predicted errors.

"Currently the only techniques for sharing governance of a deep learning model are homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Unfortunately, neither of these techniques is applicable to the training of large neural networks due to their large computational and communication overheads. As a scalable technique for shared model governance, we propose splitting deep learning model between multiple parties. This paper empirically investigates the security guarantee of this technique, which is introduced as the problem of model completion: Given the entire training data set or an environment simulator, and a subset of the parameters of a trained deep learning model, how much training is required to recover the model's original performance? We define a metric for evaluating the hardness of the model completion problem and study it empirically in both supervised learning on ImageNet and reinforcement learning on Atari and DeepMind~Lab. Our experiments show that (1) the model completion problem is harder in reinforcement learning than in supervised learning because of the unavailability of the trained agent's trajectories, and (2) its hardness depends not primarily on the number of parameters of the missing part, but more so on their type and location. Our results suggest that model splitting might be a feasible technique for shared model governance in some settings where training is very expensive.",0
"As large language models (LLMs) become more ubiquitous, scalability becomes increasingly important. This requires managing data privacy regulations while providing accurate responses to user requests. We propose model splitting as a solution to these challenges by distributing LLM training datasets among multiple parties. Our approach ensures that each party maintains control over their portion of the dataset without sacrificing overall model performance. Furthermore, our method significantly reduces the risk of unintentional sharing of sensitive information through fine-grained access controls on individual records. Ultimately, we demonstrate that our model splitting technique can effectively scale shared model governance while mitigating data privacy concerns.",1
"Deep reinforcement-learning methods have achieved remarkable performance on challenging control tasks. Observations of the resulting behavior give the impression that the agent has constructed a generalized representation that supports insightful action decisions. We re-examine what is meant by generalization in RL, and propose several definitions based on an agent's performance in on-policy, off-policy, and unreachable states. We propose a set of practical methods for evaluating agents with these definitions of generalization. We demonstrate these techniques on a common benchmark task for deep RL, and we show that the learned networks make poor decisions for states that differ only slightly from on-policy states, even though those states are not selected adversarially. Taken together, these results call into question the extent to which deep Q-networks learn generalized representations, and suggest that more experimentation and analysis is necessary before claims of representation learning can be supported.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex decision-making problems across a wide range of domains. However, one challenge that remains in deep reinforcement learning is measuring and characterizing generalization performance, which refers to how well an agent can transfer knowledge learned from one task to another. This study proposes several methods to measure and characterize generalization in deep reinforcement learning agents. Firstly, we propose using a dataset containing tasks drawn from multiple distribution shifts to evaluate generalization performance. Secondly, we use a set of analysis tools such as clustering techniques and regression analysis to identify patterns in the data that reveal insights into how different factors impact generalization performance. Finally, we evaluate our approach by applying it on two benchmark datasets and comparing results against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings show that our proposed method effectively measures and characterizes generalization performance in deep reinforcement learning. Overall, this work represents an important step towards understanding and improving the generalizability of artificial intelligence systems.",1
"We consider the problem of building a state representation model in a continual fashion. As the environment changes, the aim is to efficiently compress the sensory state's information without losing past knowledge. The learned features are then fed to a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn a policy. We propose to use Variational Auto-Encoders for state representation, and Generative Replay, i.e. the use of generated samples, to maintain past knowledge. We also provide a general and statistically sound method for automatic environment change detection. Our method provides efficient state representation as well as forward transfer, and avoids catastrophic forgetting. The resulting model is capable of incrementally learning information without using past data and with a bounded system size.",0
"One important challenge facing reinforcement learning (RL) agents is developing representations that capture the state of their environment well enough to support effective decision making. Previous work has proposed methods such as value function approximation and policy gradient methods, but these approaches can have difficulty dealing with large, high-dimensional state spaces. To address this issue, we propose a new method called continual state representation learning using generative replay. Our approach involves training an agent on a sequence of tasks while periodically storing and recalling previously encountered states from memory. These stored states are used to augment the current task's experience buffer during training, which helps the agent learn a more robust and generalizable state representation. We evaluate our method through extensive experimentation across multiple domains and find that it outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and overall performance.",1
"Efficient Reinforcement Learning usually takes advantage of demonstration or good exploration strategy. By applying posterior sampling in model-free RL under the hypothesis of GP, we propose Gaussian Process Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning(GPPSTD) algorithm in continuous state space, giving theoretical justifications and empirical results. We also provide theoretical and empirical results that various demonstration could lower expected uncertainty and benefit posterior sampling exploration. In this way, we combined the demonstration and exploration process together to achieve a more efficient reinforcement learning.",0
"This paper presents a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that uses Gaussian processes (GPs) to learn an approximation of the value function without requiring explicit models of either the environment dynamics or the reward structure. GPs provide a flexible, nonlinear regression framework that can capture complex relationships between states, actions, and rewards. Our approach takes advantage of the probabilistic nature of GPs by treating the next state as an observation noise and updating the predictive distribution over future observations using Bayesian inference. We show that our method achieves improved performance compared to existing model-based and model-free RL algorithms on several benchmark domains. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GPRL in situations where the environment is partially observable or has stochastic transitions, highlighting the robustness of our method under different environmental conditions. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on the use of GPs in RL and opens up opportunities for further research into alternative formulations of kernel functions and prior distributions to improve the efficiency and stability of GPRL algorithms.",1
"A key challenge for gradient based optimization methods in model-free reinforcement learning is to develop an approach that is sample efficient and has low variance. In this work, we apply Kronecker-factored curvature estimation technique (KFAC) to a recently proposed gradient estimator for control variate optimization, RELAX, to increase the sample efficiency of using this gradient estimation method in reinforcement learning. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on a synthetic problem and a set of three discrete control task Atari games.",0
"In recent years deep neural networks have become highly successful at addressing complex tasks such as image classification [24] but their applicability for other types of problems has been hampered by sample complexity [7]. Addressing these difficulties often requires solving challenges related to exploration vs exploitation dilemma encountered during training processes [8], i.e., choosing which action brings higher immediate reward while simultaneously accumulating knowledge towards maximizing expected cumulative rewards [6]. One possible solution is introducing randomness into decisions made by agents through use of noisy actions or even models themselves [29]; another alternative includes altering value function targets so that they better match learned policy estimates obtained from lower quality policies [10]. Another class of approaches uses control variates methods [31]. This work considers one specific methodology called Kronecker-Factored Curvature Estimation (KF-LAX) designed specifically for Value Iteration Networks (VIN), one subclass of actor-critic architectures based on Bellman residual minimization [29]. Through extensive numerical experiments performed on common benchmarks such as Pendulum, Hopper, Walker2D we demonstrate performance gains over several established baselines; furthermore KF-LAX exhibits high stability across different hyperparameter settings and network architectures. These results show significant promise for use of KF-LAX methodologies within more general classes of RL algorithms.",1
"We propose a method for modeling and learning turn-taking behaviors for accessing a shared resource. We model the individual behavior for each agent in an interaction and then use a multi-agent fusion model to generate a summary over the expected actions of the group to render the model independent of the number of agents. The individual behavior models are weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs) with weights dynamically updated during interactions, and the multi-agent fusion model is a logistic regression classifier.   We test our models in a multi-agent tower-building environment, where a Q-learning agent learns to interact with rule-based agents. Our approach accurately models the underlying behavior patterns of the rule-based agents with accuracy ranging between 0.63 and 1.0 depending on the stochasticity of the other agent behaviors. In addition we show using KL-divergence that the model accurately captures the distribution of next actions when interacting with both a single agent (KL-divergence  0.1) and with multiple agents (KL-divergence  0.37). Finally, we demonstrate that our behavior model can be used by a Q-learning agent to take turns in an interactive turn-taking environment.",0
"As machine learning techniques continue to advance, there has been increased interest in studying multi-agent systems where agents can learn from each other through shared experiences. In such settings, understanding how agents share their knowledge is crucial to achieving successful collaboration. Existing work on sharing behavior in multi-agent systems often considers two types of sharing: exact (i.e., perfect) sharing where the agent shares all relevant information without error, or noisy (i.e., imperfect) sharing where errors may occur but follow known statistical distributions. However, existing approaches assume that only two agents are involved in the learning process. In reality, many real world applications involve multiple agents interacting together. Hence, we propose a new framework for analyzing arbitrary numbers of agents that allows them to share their learning experience among themselves and build upon previous successes. Our approach combines deep reinforcement learning algorithms with tools from convex optimization theory to develop efficient sharing strategies that can achieve desirable outcomes across different problem domains. We demonstrate our methodology using simulations of various problems including resource allocation, coordination of robotic manipulators, and distributed sensing, showing that it consistently leads to better performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, our research provides novel insights into multi-agent system design and significantly expands the theoretical boundaries of collaborative learning among groups of agents.",1
"We propose a new method for learning from a single demonstration to solve hard exploration tasks like the Atari game Montezuma's Revenge. Instead of imitating human demonstrations, as proposed in other recent works, our approach is to maximize rewards directly. Our agent is trained using off-the-shelf reinforcement learning, but starts every episode by resetting to a state from a demonstration. By starting from such demonstration states, the agent requires much less exploration to learn a game compared to when it starts from the beginning of the game at every episode. We analyze reinforcement learning for tasks with sparse rewards in a simple toy environment, where we show that the run-time of standard RL methods scales exponentially in the number of states between rewards. Our method reduces this to quadratic scaling, opening up many tasks that were previously infeasible. We then apply our method to Montezuma's Revenge, for which we present a trained agent achieving a high-score of 74,500, better than any previously published result.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing algorithms that can learn complex tasks by observing human demonstrations. However, most existing approaches require multiple demonstrations before they can generalize well enough to solve novel problems within the same task domain. This work presents a new algorithm called ""Learning Monetuma's Revenge from a Single Demonstration"" (LMRS), which aims to reduce the number of required demonstrations while still achieving good performance on unseen tasks. The proposed method leverages deep neural networks and imitation learning techniques to enable robots to acquire motor skills quickly and efficiently, making them more autonomous and versatile in real-world environments. Experimental results showcase LMRS outperforming other state-of-the-art methods that rely on multiple demos, thereby highlighting the potential benefits of our approach in streamlining robotic skill acquisition processes. The findings reported in this study have important implications for robotics research and could pave the way towards enabling robots to perform even more challenging manipulation tasks than previously possible.",1
"Although deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) methods have lots of strengths that are favorable if applied to autonomous driving, real deep RL applications in autonomous driving have been slowed down by the modeling gap between the source (training) domain and the target (deployment) domain. Unlike current policy transfer approaches, which generally limit to the usage of uninterpretable neural network representations as the transferred features, we propose to transfer concrete kinematic quantities in autonomous driving. The proposed robust-control-based (RC) generic transfer architecture, which we call RL-RC, incorporates a transferable hierarchical RL trajectory planner and a robust tracking controller based on disturbance observer (DOB). The deep RL policies trained with known nominal dynamics model are transfered directly to the target domain, DOB-based robust tracking control is applied to tackle the modeling gap including the vehicle dynamics errors and the external disturbances such as side forces. We provide simulations validating the capability of the proposed method to achieve zero-shot transfer across multiple driving scenarios such as lane keeping, lane changing and obstacle avoidance.",0
"In recent years, autonomous vehicles have become a topic of great interest due to their potential to revolutionize transportation and make roads safer. One crucial aspect of developing these vehicles is designing efficient driving policies that can adapt to various scenarios and road conditions. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a promising approach. However, training a new policy from scratch for each scenario is computationally expensive and may result in suboptimal performance. This work proposes zero-shot deep reinforcement learning driving policy transfer based on robust control theory. Our method utilizes pre-trained neural networks obtained through expert demonstrations to guide the adaptation process for unseen driving tasks. We show that our method achieves better results than both random initialization and prioritized experience replay while maintaining stability. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by testing on realistic simulation environments, showing improvements over baseline methods in terms of safety measures and efficiency. These findings contribute to the development of autonomous vehicle technology and provide insights into improving the generalization capabilities of DRL algorithms.",1
"Adversarial self-play in two-player games has delivered impressive results when used with reinforcement learning algorithms that combine deep neural networks and tree search. Algorithms like AlphaZero and Expert Iteration learn tabula-rasa, producing highly informative training data on the fly. However, the self-play training strategy is not directly applicable to single-player games. Recently, several practically important combinatorial optimisation problems, such as the travelling salesman problem and the bin packing problem, have been reformulated as reinforcement learning problems, increasing the importance of enabling the benefits of self-play beyond two-player games. We present the Ranked Reward (R2) algorithm which accomplishes this by ranking the rewards obtained by a single agent over multiple games to create a relative performance metric. Results from applying the R2 algorithm to instances of a two-dimensional and three-dimensional bin packing problems show that it outperforms generic Monte Carlo tree search, heuristic algorithms and integer programming solvers. We also present an analysis of the ranked reward mechanism, in particular, the effects of problem instances with varying difficulty and different ranking thresholds.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for self-play reinforcement learning (RL) in combinatorial optimization problems using ranked rewards. Traditional methods use scalar reward functions that may not capture important aspects of the problem, such as relative advantage/disadvantage between solutions. In contrast, our method uses rankings of solution quality to guide exploration and exploitation during self-play. We show how ranked rewards can improve both sample efficiency and final performance compared to scalar rewards on several benchmark problems. Our results demonstrate the potential of using ranked rewards for self-play in combinatorial optimization, particularly in situations where scalar rewards are insufficient.",1
"Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in the wild to perform a wide range of tasks. In this work, we ask to what extent can an adversary steal functionality of such ""victim"" models based solely on blackbox interactions: image in, predictions out. In contrast to prior work, we present an adversary lacking knowledge of train/test data used by the model, its internals, and semantics over model outputs. We formulate model functionality stealing as a two-step approach: (i) querying a set of input images to the blackbox model to obtain predictions; and (ii) training a ""knockoff"" with queried image-prediction pairs. We make multiple remarkable observations: (a) querying random images from a different distribution than that of the blackbox training data results in a well-performing knockoff; (b) this is possible even when the knockoff is represented using a different architecture; and (c) our reinforcement learning approach additionally improves query sample efficiency in certain settings and provides performance gains. We validate model functionality stealing on a range of datasets and tasks, as well as on a popular image analysis API where we create a reasonable knockoff for as little as $30.",0
"Artificial intelligence research has produced many remarkable models that have revolutionized various application domains such as vision, natural language processing, robotics, etc. These state-of-the-art models usually require vast computational resources and proprietary data, making them unavailable to researchers without access to large-scale infrastructure or funding from tech giants. In this work, we propose a novel technique called “Knockoff Nets” which enables anyone to replicate functions of black-box deep learning models using readily available public datasets and consumer-grade hardware. Our method leverages knowledge distillation and adversarial training to transfer knowledge from powerful teacher models to lightweight student networks. We provide extensive experiments on benchmark image classification tasks and ablation studies highlighting the effectiveness of our approach against prior art. Additionally, we showcase applications of Knockoff Nets in real-world scenarios where obtaining high-quality annotations could be challenging, thus promoting democratization of artificial intelligence development. Overall, we believe Knockoff Nets can serve as a significant milestone towards creating more accessible AI technologies while ensuring comparable performance to their expensive counterparts.

"Recent research has shown that although Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit from expert demonstration, it usually takes considerable efforts to obtain enough demonstration. The efforts prevent training decent RL agents with expert demonstration in practice. In this work, we propose Active Reinforcement Learning with Demonstration (ARLD), a new framework to streamline RL in terms of demonstration efforts by allowing the RL agent to query for demonstration actively during training. Under the framework, we propose Active Deep Q-Network, a novel query strategy which adapts to the dynamically-changing distributions during the RL training process by estimating the uncertainty of recent states. The expert demonstration data within Active DQN are then utilized by optimizing supervised max-margin loss in addition to temporal difference loss within usual DQN training. We propose two methods of estimating the uncertainty based on two state-of-the-art DQN models, namely the divergence of bootstrapped DQN and the variance of noisy DQN. The empirical results validate that both methods not only learn faster than other passive expert demonstration methods with the same amount of demonstration and but also reach super-expert level of performance across four different tasks.",0
"Title: Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback with Active Deep Q-Networks (DeepQ) and Demonstrations  Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has seen significant advances due to improvements in model architectures and training methods. However, these models often struggle with complex real-world tasks that require large amounts of exploration and generalization across multiple environments. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called ""Active Deep Q-Learning with Demonstertrations"" (DeepQ+Demon). Our method combines active sampling techniques with human feedback and demonstrations to improve both the performance and efficiency of the agent. We use a recurrent neural network as our deep Q-network, which enables us to capture temporal dependencies in state representations. Furthermore, we integrate a novel self-attention mechanism into the network architecture, allowing the agent to focus on relevant parts of the environment during decision making. Using experiments on several benchmark domains, including Atari games, RoboCup Soccer, and simulated robotic manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better results compared to traditional deep Q-learning methods while requiring significantly fewer interactions with the environment. Additionally, we show that the integration of human demonstrations can further enhance performance by providing additional guidance to the agent during policy improvement. This work represents an important step towards building agents capable of solving challenging problems in uncertain and partially observable environments under limited time budgets and access to expert knowledge.",1
"We present an off-policy actor-critic algorithm for Reinforcement Learning (RL) that combines ideas from gradient-free optimization via stochastic search with learned action-value function. The result is a simple procedure consisting of three steps: i) policy evaluation by estimating a parametric action-value function; ii) policy improvement via the estimation of a local non-parametric policy; and iii) generalization by fitting a parametric policy. Each step can be implemented in different ways, giving rise to several algorithm variants. Our algorithm draws on connections to existing literature on black-box optimization and 'RL as an inference' and it can be seen either as an extension of the Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimisation algorithm (MPO) [Abdolmaleki et al., 2018a], or as an extension of Trust Region Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) [Abdolmaleki et al., 2017b; Hansen et al., 1997] to a policy iteration scheme. Our comparison on 31 continuous control tasks from parkour suite [Heess et al., 2017], DeepMind control suite [Tassa et al., 2018] and OpenAI Gym [Brockman et al., 2016] with diverse properties, limited amount of compute and a single set of hyperparameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the state of art results.

"In Reinforcement Learning (RL), policy iteration algorithms have been used as effective ways to find optimal policies for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, traditional policy iteration methods suffer from two main issues: they can become trapped in local maxima and their performance depends on the initialization of the policy. To address these problems, we propose Relative Entropy Policy Iteration (REPI) which uses relative entropy regularization during the iterative process. We show that our method has several advantages over existing methods such as faster convergence rates and better stability. Moreover, REPI provides more meaningful solutions than other RL approaches by providing well behaved probability distributions instead of point estimates. Additionally, we provide numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of REPI compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1
"The capacity of meta-learning algorithms to quickly adapt to a variety of tasks, including ones they did not experience during meta-training, has been a key factor in the recent success of these methods on few-shot learning problems. This particular advantage of using meta-learning over standard supervised or reinforcement learning is only well founded under the assumption that the adaptation phase does improve the performance of our model on the task of interest. However, in the classical framework of meta-learning, this constraint is only mildly enforced, if not at all, and we only see an improvement on average over a distribution of tasks. In this paper, we show that the adaptation in an algorithm like MAML can significantly decrease the performance of an agent in a meta-reinforcement learning setting, even on a range of meta-training tasks.",0
"In this paper we investigate negative adaptation in model agnostic meta learning (MAML). We focus on understanding how it works in practice by conducting experiments on several benchmark datasets and comparing its performance against other state-of-the art methods. Our results demonstrate that negative adaptation can improve generalization ability across tasks without negatively impacting sample efficiency. Additionally, our analysis shows that models trained using negative adaptation tend to have lower entropy compared to those trained without it, indicating better calibration. These findings suggest new directions for improving MAML based systems in the future.",1
"We propose to compose dynamic tree structures that place the objects in an image into a visual context, helping visual reasoning tasks such as scene graph generation and visual Q&A. Our visual context tree model, dubbed VCTree, has two key advantages over existing structured object representations including chains and fully-connected graphs: 1) The efficient and expressive binary tree encodes the inherent parallel/hierarchical relationships among objects, e.g., ""clothes"" and ""pants"" are usually co-occur and belong to ""person""; 2) the dynamic structure varies from image to image and task to task, allowing more content-/task-specific message passing among objects. To construct a VCTree, we design a score function that calculates the task-dependent validity between each object pair, and the tree is the binary version of the maximum spanning tree from the score matrix. Then, visual contexts are encoded by bidirectional TreeLSTM and decoded by task-specific models. We develop a hybrid learning procedure which integrates end-task supervised learning and the tree structure reinforcement learning, where the former's evaluation result serves as a self-critic for the latter's structure exploration. Experimental results on two benchmarks, which require reasoning over contexts: Visual Genome for scene graph generation and VQA2.0 for visual Q&A, show that VCTree outperforms state-of-the-art results while discovering interpretable visual context structures.",0
"This paper presents a deep learning approach based on variational autoencoders that learns generative models able to compose dynamic tree structures for visual contexts. By jointly training an encoder network and decoder network, we learn complex distributions over compositional scenes allowing us to generate novel and diverse image outputs while maintaining their coherency and plausibility with respect to the given inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through several challenging tasks such as object addition, removal, scene completion, and object transfiguration in both static and video settings showing state-of-the art performance against existing methods. Our results provide important insights into future directions in the field of computer vision by enabling the creation of virtual worlds from real images, synthesizing new scenarios using natural language descriptions, and developing advanced editing tools in image manipulation systems. As one example, generating diverse variations of a scene can aid users in decision making processes in applications like architecture design, urban planning, and moviemaking. With these promising achievements, we believe this work opens up opportunities for broader exploration in computational imagery and creativity research.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of evaluating learning systems in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, where failures can have catastrophic consequences. We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios when learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure. The standard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte Carlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents. We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature and propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of failure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial situations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive optimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns failure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse of data already collected for training the agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and simulated driving. Experimental results show that our methods can find catastrophic failures and estimate failures rates of agents multiple orders of magnitude faster than standard evaluation schemes, in minutes to hours rather than days.",0
"As machine learning algorithms become increasingly integrated into critical systems and applications, evaluating their performance becomes more crucial than ever before. However, traditional evaluation methods often fail to identify catastrophic failure modes that can have devastating consequences on human life and society at large. In this work, we propose a novel approach to agent evaluation using adversaries trained specifically to uncover these catastrophic failures. Our approach leverages recent advances in generative models to create diverse and challenging environments for agents to navigate, enabling us to effectively identify scenarios where even well-trained agents can fail disastrously. We demonstrate our method through extensive experiments across multiple domains and show its effectiveness in identifying previously unknown failure modes in state-of-the-art agents. Finally, we discuss how our approach can guide future research towards building safer, more robust artificial intelligence systems. This research contributes both theoretically and practically towards ensuring that machine learning models behave reliably and safely in mission-critical contexts, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.",1
"The recently proposed option-critic architecture Bacon et al. provide a stochastic policy gradient approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning. Specifically, they provide a way to estimate the gradient of the expected discounted return with respect to parameters that define a finite number of temporally extended actions, called \textit{options}. In this paper we show how the option-critic architecture can be extended to estimate the natural gradient of the expected discounted return. To this end, the central questions that we consider in this paper are: 1) what is the definition of the natural gradient in this context, 2) what is the Fisher information matrix associated with an option's parameterized policy, 3) what is the Fisher information matrix associated with an option's parameterized termination function, and 4) how can a compatible function approximation approach be leveraged to obtain natural gradient estimates for both the parameterized policy and parameterized termination functions of an option with per-time-step time and space complexity linear in the total number of parameters. Based on answers to these questions we introduce the natural option critic algorithm. Experimental results showcase improvement over the vanilla gradient approach.",0
"This paper presents an analysis of natural option critic (NOC), which is a method that evaluates the effectiveness of conservation efforts by comparing them to alternatives that could have been pursued instead. NOC seeks to identify tradeoffs between different options and make transparent the costs and benefits of choosing one path over another. By considering both the positive outcomes achieved through interventions and the opportunity cost of forgone alternative actions, NOC helps decision makers evaluate the overall merits of specific policies or projects. Additionally, this approach can contribute to broader debates on the effectiveness of environmental policy and conservation strategies more generally. The paper reviews case studies where NOC has been applied in practice, highlighting key findings and insights gained from these experiences. Ultimately, the goal of the paper is to advance understanding of NOC as a tool for informed decision making in conservation and environmental management contexts.",1
"For an autonomous agent to fulfill a wide range of user-specified goals at test time, it must be able to learn broadly applicable and general-purpose skill repertoires. Furthermore, to provide the requisite level of generality, these skills must handle raw sensory input such as images. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that acquires such general-purpose skills by combining unsupervised representation learning and reinforcement learning of goal-conditioned policies. Since the particular goals that might be required at test-time are not known in advance, the agent performs a self-supervised ""practice"" phase where it imagines goals and attempts to achieve them. We learn a visual representation with three distinct purposes: sampling goals for self-supervised practice, providing a structured transformation of raw sensory inputs, and computing a reward signal for goal reaching. We also propose a retroactive goal relabeling scheme to further improve the sample-efficiency of our method. Our off-policy algorithm is efficient enough to learn policies that operate on raw image observations and goals for a real-world robotic system, and substantially outperforms prior techniques.",0
"In recent years, the use of reinforcement learning (RL) has been on the rise due to its ability to train agents in complex tasks without explicit programming. However, traditional RL algorithms suffer from drawbacks such as high sample complexity and slow convergence rates. As a result, researchers have turned their attention towards approaches that can improve upon these limitations. One promising direction involves incorporating imagination into the training process, allowing agents to simulate novel situations before encountering them in real life. This idea forms the basis of visual reinforcement learning with imagined goals (VILG), which we propose as a new algorithm for accelerating and improving RL performance. Our study evaluates VILG across multiple domains, including continuous control tasks, text generation, and Montezuma’s Revenge, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our findings suggest that incorporating imagination-based strategies into RL holds great potential for advancing artificial intelligence research. Overall, we believe that VILG offers a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning by providing a more efficient and effective approach for teaching agents how to achieve their goals.",1
"A vine copula model is a flexible high-dimensional dependence model which uses only bivariate building blocks. However, the number of possible configurations of a vine copula grows exponentially as the number of variables increases, making model selection a major challenge in development. In this work, we formulate a vine structure learning problem with both vector and reinforcement learning representation. We use neural network to find the embeddings for the best possible vine model and generate a structure. Throughout experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our proposed approach fits the data better in terms of log-likelihood. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model is able to generate high-quality samples in a variety of applications, making it a good candidate for synthetic data generation.",0
"This research proposes a novel approach for synthetic data generation using vine copulas, which are flexible multivariate distributions that can capture complex dependencies among variables. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on simple assumptions like normality or independence, our method allows for realistic modeling of diverse and complicated patterns in high dimensional datasets. We present two algorithms: one based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and another on conditional inference trees (CIT). Our evaluation shows that both methods generate valid and accurate models that match real world distribution properties. In particular, we observe better accuracy compared to popular alternatives such as the Gaussian mixture model and factor analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications of our framework to several domains including finance, medicine and social sciences where privacy concerns make access to sensitive data challenging. Overall, our work paves the way towards more powerful and robust data augmentation techniques and highlights the potential benefits of exploiting richer statistical structures than standard uni-variate ones.",1
"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) are envisioned to play a critical role in improving traffic flow and reducing congestion, which is a pervasive issue impacting urban areas around the globe. Rapidly advancing vehicular communication and edge cloud computation technologies provide key enablers for smart traffic management. However, operating viable real-time actuation mechanisms on a practically relevant scale involves formidable challenges, e.g., policy iteration and conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques suffer from poor scalability due to state space explosion. Motivated by these issues, we explore the potential for Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to optimize traffic light control policies. As an initial benchmark, we establish that the DQN algorithms yield the ""thresholding"" policy in a single-intersection. Next, we examine the scalability properties of DQN algorithms and their performance in a linear network topology with several intersections along a main artery. We demonstrate that DQN algorithms produce intelligent behavior, such as the emergence of ""greenwave"" patterns, reflecting their ability to learn favorable traffic light actuations.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an increasingly important role in transportation systems. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), which applies technology to traffic management to improve safety, efficiency, and sustainability, offers great potential for AI applications. Among all AI techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) stands out as a powerful tool to develop efficient and adaptive solutions towards intelligent transportation problems due to its ability to learn from trial and error interactions with complex environments without explicit programming. In this work, we present deep RL methods that can significantly improve their performance by extracting hierarchical features through deep neural networks. Furthermore, we show how these deep RL methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple ITS tasks including multi-lane merging control at highway exit ramps, traffic signal optimization, and autonomous driving with obstacle avoidance. Our results demonstrate that deep RL methods provide effective solutions that can scale up to more realistic problems and have promising prospects for future deployment. This research opens new opportunities for developing advanced ITS technologies that leverage recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. By enabling real-time decision making based on dynamic environmental feedback and considering both short-term and long-term objectives, these advanced technologies hold great promise in optimizing mobility while reducing negative impacts on traffic operation and road users. Ultimately, the integration of AI into ITS systems may revolutionize transportation operations and enable next-generation services such as driverless cars.",1
"De novo protein structure prediction from amino acid sequence is one of the most challenging problems in computational biology. As one of the extensively explored mathematical models for protein folding, Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model enables thorough investigation of protein structure formation and evolution. Although HP model discretizes the conformational space and simplifies the folding energy function, it has been proven to be an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose a novel protein folding framework FoldingZero, self-folding a de novo protein 2D HP structure from scratch based on deep reinforcement learning. FoldingZero features the coupled approach of a two-head (policy and value heads) deep convolutional neural network (HPNet) and a regularized Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees (R-UCT). It is trained solely by a reinforcement learning algorithm, which improves HPNet and R-UCT iteratively through iterative policy optimization. Without any supervision and domain knowledge, FoldingZero not only achieves comparable results, but also learns the latent folding knowledge to stabilize the structure. Without exponential computation, FoldingZero shows promising potential to be adopted for real-world protein properties prediction.",0
"""In recent years, the field of protein folding has seen significant progress due to advances in computational methods and simulations. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of how proteins can fold from scratch in hydrophobic-polar (HP) environments. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel algorithm called FoldingZero that simulates protein folding from first principles using only physical interactions present in HP model. Our approach leverages deep learning techniques to train the algorithm on large datasets of prefolded conformations, enabling efficient exploration of the conformational space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FoldingZero by applying it to several test cases involving small and medium-sized proteins, and comparing its results against experimental data and other simulation methods. The results show that FoldingZero accurately predicts the native structure of the proteins, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for investigating complex biological systems.""

"This paper explores a simple regularizer for reinforcement learning by proposing Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL), which encourages the agent to imitate past good trajectories via generative adversarial imitation learning framework. Instead of directly maximizing rewards, GASIL focuses on reproducing past good trajectories, which can potentially make long-term credit assignment easier when rewards are sparse and delayed. GASIL can be easily combined with any policy gradient objective by using GASIL as a learned shaped reward function. Our experimental results show that GASIL improves the performance of proximal policy optimization on 2D Point Mass and MuJoCo environments with delayed reward and stochastic dynamics.",0
"In the context of training generative models, imitation learning can take advantage of pretrained systems by utilizing their outputs as guidance during training, allowing for improved generation capabilities over the course of self-supervised fine-tuning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL), which leverages two discriminators to improve the quality of generated images. To achieve this goal, GASIL first uses one discriminator that acts as a teacher to guide image synthesis towards high fidelity output, while the second serves as a student that learns from the guided images until it becomes capable of generating coherent, diverse images on its own without any further assistance from real data examples. By combining both roles into a unified framework, GASIL demonstrates remarkable performance across several benchmark datasets compared against state-of-the art methods. This work showcases a novel approach towards self-imitation learning through adversarial optimization techniques with promising potentials in diverse applications such as computer vision and graphics.",1
"Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems aim to provide interacting agents with the ability to collaboratively learn and adapt to the behaviour of other agents. In many real-world applications, the agents can only acquire a partial view of the world. Here we consider a setting whereby most agents' observations are also extremely noisy, hence only weakly correlated to the true state of the environment. Under these circumstances, learning an optimal policy becomes particularly challenging, even in the unrealistic case that an agent's policy can be made conditional upon all other agents' observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm enhanced by a communication medium (MADDPG-M), which implements a two-level, concurrent learning mechanism. An agent's policy depends on its own private observations as well as those explicitly shared by others through a communication medium. At any given point in time, an agent must decide whether its private observations are sufficiently informative to be shared with others. However, our environments provide no explicit feedback informing an agent whether a communication action is beneficial, rather the communication policies must also be learned through experience concurrently to the main policies. Our experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in six highly non-stationary environments of progressively higher complexity, and offers substantial performance gains compared to the baselines.",0
"In this paper we examine multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) under extremely noisy observations. We propose a novel framework which combines multi-agent actor critic methods with generative adversarial networks. Our approach explicitly models noise as an agent in our environment, allowing us to train agents that can effectively learn despite extreme observation uncertainty. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MADRL methods on challenging control tasks where traditional approaches fail due to high levels of observational uncertainty. The implications of these findings extend beyond the field of machine learning, suggesting potential applications to real world problems involving uncertain observations such as robotics and computer vision.

"Advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning have led to agents that perform well across a variety of sensory-motor domains. In this work, we study the setting in which an agent must learn to generate programs for diverse scenes conditioned on a given symbolic instruction. Final goals are specified to our agent via images of the scenes. A symbolic instruction consistent with the goal images is used as the conditioning input for our policies. Since a single instruction corresponds to a diverse set of different but still consistent end-goal images, the agent needs to learn to generate a distribution over programs given an instruction. We demonstrate that with simple changes to the reinforced adversarial learning objective, we can learn instruction conditioned policies to achieve the corresponding diverse set of goals. Most importantly, our agent's stochastic policy is shown to more accurately capture the diversity in the goal distribution than a fixed pixel-based reward function baseline. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two domains: (1) drawing MNIST digits with a paint software conditioned on instructions and (2) constructing scenes in a 3D editor that satisfies a certain instruction.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in recent years thanks to advances in deep learning techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL). However, training RL agents can still be time-consuming and difficult due to their tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions or getting stuck in local optima. One approach that has shown promise for overcoming these issues is adversarial learning, which involves adding noise or randomization to environments or reward functions during training. This allows the agent to explore different parts of solution space and improve its performance. In this work, we propose a new method called instruction conditioned reinforced adversarial learning (ICRA) that combines traditional RL with both reward shaping and adversarial learning. Our algorithm uses a neural network to predict human instructions given partial observations of the environment state, and incorporates those predictions into the policy optimization process by making them contingencies in the rewards or constraints on actions taken. We show through experiments using several benchmark tasks that ICRA leads to more diverse programs compared to standard RL approaches while maintaining competitive levels of performance. The code for our implementation will be released upon publication to encourage further research in this area.",1
"To solve a text-based game, an agent needs to formulate valid text commands for a given context and find the ones that lead to success. Recent attempts at solving text-based games with deep reinforcement learning have focused on the latter, i.e., learning to act optimally when valid actions are known in advance. In this work, we propose to tackle the first task and train a model that generates the set of all valid commands for a given context. We try three generative models on a dataset generated with Textworld. The best model can generate valid commands which were unseen at training and achieve high $F_1$ score on the test set.",0
"This research introduces novel methods to allow machines to learn adaptive strategies across diverse games without requiring human-designed rules or hints. We leverage deep neural networks for generating game-specific action spaces that reflect how actions lead to outcomes in each environment. By generalizing beyond specific games towards more effective learning on new games via meta learning, we overcome limitations posed by traditional techniques which struggle when there is little data. Our method leads to high scores on Atari, VizDoom, and GVGAI. Furthermore, we showcase our approach running directly off raw textual descriptions. Future work can build upon these results to develop agents for real-time strategy games that could potentially compete against top players. Overall, our findings constitute an important step towards enabling artificial intelligence to tackle complex decision making problems in dynamic environments.",1
"Target tracking in a camera network is an important task for surveillance and scene understanding. The task is challenging due to disjoint views and illumination variation in different cameras. In this direction, many graph-based methods were proposed using appearance-based features. However, the appearance information fades with high illumination variation in the different camera FOVs. We, in this paper, use spatial and temporal information as the state of the target to learn a policy that predicts the next camera given the current state. The policy is trained using Q-learning and it does not assume any information about the topology of the camera network. We will show that the policy learns the camera network topology. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on the NLPR MCT dataset.",0
"This could refer either to a physical camera network (e.g., a collection of cameras installed at different locations), or to a neural network that has been trained on images from multiple cameras. The approach described involves training an agent (an artificial intelligence program) using reinforcement learning, which involves setting goals and rewarding the agent for achieving them. The goal in this case is tracking moving objects within the camera network; the agent learns how to adjust the position of each camera so as to keep the target object within view. The use of a multi-agent system allows the camera network to track multiple targets simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to previous methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness under various conditions.",1

"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches in artificial intelligence research. This rapidly developing field combines advances from both deep learning and reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn complex behaviors from raw sensory inputs without any hand engineering of features or reward functions. As such, DRL holds great potential for solving real-world problems, including robotics, natural language processing, game playing, and autonomous driving. While many introductory articles and tutorials exist on both deep learning and reinforcement learning separately, there lacks a concise yet comprehensive overview that spans both topics while emphasizing their intersection in DRL. Therefore, our article fills this gap by providing a self-contained introduction to the fundamentals of deep reinforcement learning for readers new to these fields. First, we discuss the basic concepts of RL and introduce popular algorithms like Q-learning, policy gradient methods, and actor–critic models. Next, we explain the role of neural networks in representing value function approximators and policies, delving into common architectures such as deep Q networks (DQNs), double DQNs, dueling DQNs, and recurrent deep Q-networks (DRQNs).

"In urban environments, supply resources have to be constantly matched to the ""right"" locations (where customer demand is present) so as to improve quality of life. For instance, ambulances have to be matched to base stations regularly so as to reduce response time for emergency incidents in EMS (Emergency Management Systems); vehicles (cars, bikes, scooters etc.) have to be matched to docking stations so as to reduce lost demand in shared mobility systems. Such problem domains are challenging owing to the demand uncertainty, combinatorial action spaces (due to allocation) and constraints on allocation of resources (e.g., total resources, minimum and maximum number of resources at locations and regions).   Existing systems typically employ myopic and greedy optimization approaches to optimize allocation of supply resources to locations. Such approaches typically are unable to handle surges or variances in demand patterns well. Recent research has demonstrated the ability of Deep RL methods in adapting well to highly uncertain environments. However, existing Deep RL methods are unable to handle combinatorial action spaces and constraints on allocation of resources. To that end, we have developed three approaches on top of the well known actor critic approach, DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) that are able to handle constraints on resource allocation. More importantly, we demonstrate that they are able to outperform leading approaches on simulators validated on semi-real and real data sets.",0
"In this work we present resource constrained deep reinforcement learning (RCRL), a novel approach that extends existing model free deep reinforcement learning algorithms to domains where resources such as computation time or memory may be limited. RCRL overcomes these constraints by leveraging approximate inference techniques commonly used in deep generative models, which trade off some exactness to gain computational efficiency. Empirical results show that our method can learn successful policies in environments where traditional model free deep RL methods cannot run within resource budgets, while achieving performance competitive with state of the art unconstrained model free deep RL on larger problems. Our contributions therefore pave the path towards applying deep learning based control in settings previously considered difficult due to computational limitations.",1
"Recent studies on neural architecture search have shown that automatically designed neural networks perform as good as expert-crafted architectures. While most existing works aim at finding architectures that optimize the prediction accuracy, these architectures may have complexity and is therefore not suitable being deployed on certain computing environment (e.g., with limited power budgets). We propose MONAS, a framework for Multi-Objective Neural Architectural Search that employs reward functions considering both prediction accuracy and other important objectives (e.g., power consumption) when searching for neural network architectures. Experimental results showed that, compared to the state-ofthe-arts, models found by MONAS achieve comparable or better classification accuracy on computer vision applications, while satisfying the additional objectives such as peak power.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been revolutionized by recent advances in deep neural network architectures such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, transformers, among others that have achieved state-of-the art performance on several benchmarks across diverse domains including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, robotics etc. Most prominently, neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful technique to automate designing novel models by iteratively optimizing architecture parameters with respect to chosen metrics. While most existing works focus primarily on minimizing prediction errors at training set, they fail to consider other significant objectives like model size, computational cost, memory usage, generalization ability, validation error, and others which can impact overall performance of real world applications where deployment demands efficient hardware utilization and low latency besides high accuracy predictions. In this study, we propose multi-objective neural architecture search (MONAS), a new reinforcement learning based framework aimed towards generating artificial intelligence models with optimized trade-offs between multiple objectives, enabling more informed decisions during the design process. We first evaluate MONAS against single objective NAS on popular benchmark datasets covering image classification, language translation tasks. Our findings show that our proposed method consistently generates competitive results achieving better or similar accuracies than baselines while satisfying constraints in terms of model size, inference time and number of floating point operations FLOPS. Furthermore, extensive analysis confirms that MONAS efficiently explores architectural space, discovers unique architectures better suited for specific target tasks that differ from human designed or previously discovered models.

"Semi-supervised learning is attracting increasing attention due to the fact that datasets of many domains lack enough labeled data. Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), in particular, has demonstrated the benefits of semi-supervised learning. The majority of existing semi-supervised VAEs utilize a classifier to exploit label information, where the parameters of the classifier are introduced to the VAE. Given the limited labeled data, learning the parameters for the classifiers may not be an optimal solution for exploiting label information. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a novel approach for semi-supervised VAE without classifier. Specifically, we propose a new model called Semi-supervised Disentangled VAE (SDVAE), which encodes the input data into disentangled representation and non-interpretable representation, then the category information is directly utilized to regularize the disentangled representation via the equality constraint. To further enhance the feature learning ability of the proposed VAE, we incorporate reinforcement learning to relieve the lack of data. The dynamic framework is capable of dealing with both image and text data with its corresponding encoder and decoder networks. Extensive experiments on image and text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",0
"This paper presents a new deep learning method called the ""Disentangled Variational Auto-encoder"" (DVA) which utilizes semi-supervised learning techniques to improve accuracy on supervised training tasks. DVAs achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively leveraging unlabeled data during training through a combination of auto-encoding and variational inference principles. By disentangling the underlying factors of variation in the data, DVAs can learn meaningful representations that generalize well across multiple domains. Our experiments demonstrate that DVAs outperform other popular methods such as UMAP and InfoMap on several benchmark datasets, making them an attractive choice for unsupervised representation learning.",1

This paper proposes a novel DRL algorithm called Practical Deep Reinforcement Learning (PractiDRL), which addresses these limitations by utilizing state-of-the-art techniques from both deep learning and classical model-free RL to achieve better performance on benchmark stock trading tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that PractiDRL outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer interactions with the environment, thus highlighting the potential benefits of using advanced machine learning techniques for solving real-world decision making problems.",1
"Curriculum learning in reinforcement learning is a training methodology that seeks to speed up learning of a difficult target task, by first training on a series of simpler tasks and transferring the knowledge acquired to the target task. Automatically choosing a sequence of such tasks (i.e. a curriculum) is an open problem that has been the subject of much recent work in this area. In this paper, we build upon a recent method for curriculum design, which formulates the curriculum sequencing problem as a Markov Decision Process. We extend this model to handle multiple transfer learning algorithms, and show for the first time that a curriculum policy over this MDP can be learned from experience. We explore various representations that make this possible, and evaluate our approach by learning curriculum policies for multiple agents in two different domains. The results show that our method produces curricula that can train agents to perform on a target task as fast or faster than existing methods.",0
"Here we describe policy search methods and two different approaches to learning curriculums that can be used in conjunction with on-policy methods: Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR), which applies random perturbations to the environment to encourage exploration; and Successive Elimination of Unpromising Variants (SEUV), which iteratively selects successful variants for further training while discarding unsuccessful ones. Both approaches have been shown effective at speeding up reinforcement learning algorithms significantly but there has yet to be any evaluation on how these might interact with off-policymethods like CPO and TD3+BCQ which are state of the art deep RL policies. We compare against four other state of the art baselines: BCQ, DDPG, Retrace[*], and RELM. We evaluate performance using three environments: Lunar Lander, Acrobot, and Mountain Car Continuous Control Task. Our results show SEUV performed best overall on all three tasks and was able to increase average return by over 4x compared to no curriculum or just domain randomization alone. In conclusion, careful selection of the learning algorithm alongside the choice of curriculum can greatly impact the efficiency of training in reinforcement learning.",1
"Current clinical practice to monitor patients' health follows either regular or heuristic-based lab test (e.g. blood test) scheduling. Such practice not only gives rise to redundant measurements accruing cost, but may even lead to unnecessary patient discomfort. From the computational perspective, heuristic-based test scheduling might lead to reduced accuracy of clinical forecasting models. Computationally learning an optimal clinical test scheduling and measurement collection, is likely to lead to both, better predictive models and patient outcome improvement. We address the scheduling problem using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve high predictive gain and low measurement cost, by scheduling fewer, but strategically timed tests. We first show that in the simulation our policy outperforms heuristic-based measurement scheduling with higher predictive gain or lower cost measured by accumulated reward. We then learn a scheduling policy for mortality forecasting in the real-world clinical dataset (MIMIC3), our learned policy is able to provide useful clinical insights. To our knowledge, this is the first RL application on multi-measurement scheduling problem in the clinical setting.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing complex decision making problems. One such problem that has received significant attention is adverse event forecasting, which involves predicting undesirable events that may have severe consequences if left unaddressed. Traditional approaches to adverse event prediction typically rely on static measurement schedules, where measurements are taken at fixed intervals regardless of the current state of the system. However, these methods can be suboptimal since they fail to account for the dynamic nature of many real-world systems. This work presents a new methodology for dynamic measurement scheduling using deep RL that overcomes some of the limitations of traditional approaches. Our proposed algorithm adapts the measurement schedule based on the current state of the system, allowing for more accurate predictions of adverse events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and experiments on several benchmark domains. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms static measurement scheduling techniques, providing a powerful tool for effective adverse event prediction in a wide range of applications.",1

In this paper, firstly, we augment Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) method with a novel self-supervised auxiliary task, i.e. \emph{Terminal Prediction}, measuring temporal closeness to terminal states, namely A3C-TP. Secondly, we propose a new framework where planning algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search or other sources of (simulated) demonstrators can be integrated to asynchronous distributed DRL methods.

"Title: ""Using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a demonstration tool within asynchronous deep reinforcement learning""  In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has made significant progress towards creating intelligent agents that can solve complex problems and make decisions based on their environment. One popular method used by these agents is reinforcement learning (RL), which involves training an agent to take actions in order to maximize a reward signal. In this study, we focus specifically on the application of MCTS, a state-of-the-art tree search algorithm, in the domain of deep RL algorithms. We propose using MCTS as a demonstration tool within asynchronous deep RL to better understand how these systems work and how they interact with their environments. By examining the interactions between these two systems, we aim to gain insights into how RL algorithms learn from their experiences and improve over time. Our results show that MCTS is effective at providing a clear and comprehensive understanding of the behavior of deep RL systems, making it an ideal choice for use as a demonstration tool.",1
"Solving tasks with sparse rewards is a main challenge in reinforcement learning. While hierarchical controllers are an intuitive approach to this problem, current methods often require manual reward shaping, alternating training phases, or manually defined sub tasks. We introduce modulated policy hierarchies (MPH), that can learn end-to-end to solve tasks from sparse rewards. To achieve this, we study different modulation signals and exploration for hierarchical controllers. Specifically, we find that communicating via bit-vectors is more efficient than selecting one out of multiple skills, as it enables mixing between them. To facilitate exploration, MPH uses its different time scales for temporally extended intrinsic motivation at each level of the hierarchy. We evaluate MPH on the robotics tasks of pushing and sparse block stacking, where it outperforms recent baselines.",0
"Abstract: Policy hierarchies have proven effective in solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently. However, existing policy hierarchy approaches suffer from several limitations such as inflexibility, lack of modularity, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called ""Modulated Policy Hierarchies"" (MPH) which addresses these limitations. MPH allows policies at different levels to communicate and coordinate their decisions through a unique communication protocol. This enables efficient use of computation resources and enables faster convergence. Moreover, MPH supports flexible decomposition of tasks allowing policies at different levels to focus on different aspects of the problem while retaining global objectives. We evaluate our proposed framework using challenging benchmark domains and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in handling complex decision making scenarios requiring coordination among multiple agents. Overall, our work shows promise in advancing research towards more intelligent, flexible, and scalable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning methods traditionally struggle with tasks where environment rewards are particularly sparse. One successful method of guiding exploration in these domains is to imitate trajectories provided by a human demonstrator. However, these demonstrations are typically collected under artificial conditions, i.e. with access to the agent's exact environment setup and the demonstrator's action and reward trajectories. Here we propose a two-stage method that overcomes these limitations by relying on noisy, unaligned footage without access to such data. First, we learn to map unaligned videos from multiple sources to a common representation using self-supervised objectives constructed over both time and modality (i.e. vision and sound). Second, we embed a single YouTube video in this representation to construct a reward function that encourages an agent to imitate human gameplay. This method of one-shot imitation allows our agent to convincingly exceed human-level performance on the infamously hard exploration games Montezuma's Revenge, Pitfall! and Private Eye for the first time, even if the agent is not presented with any environment rewards.",0
"Exploration games have become increasingly popular as players seek immersive experiences that challenge them to uncover hidden paths, discover secret treasures, and overcome obstacles without explicit guidance. With many popular titles such as ""No Man's Sky"" and ""Metroid Prime,"" these games provide a sense of adventure and mystery that keeps players engaged for hours on end. However, one issue that arises from playing these types of games is the fear of missing out (FOMO) when it comes to exploring every possible corner of the game world. This leads some gamers to spend countless hours trying different strategies, experimenting with new techniques, and searching online forums for tips and tricks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to addressing FOMO in exploration games: using video tutorials posted on platforms like YouTube to observe how experienced players navigate the game world and gather important resources. By analyzing player movements, item collection patterns, and decision making, novice gamers can learn effective strategies while minimizing time spent wandering aimlessly through virtual environments. Our methodology involves identifying key moments of player behavior in videos, classifying common actions into categories such as combat, puzzle solving, and resource acquisition, and creating step-by-step guides based on these observations. We then tested our system with participants who played the open world survival game ""The Long Dark."" Results showed that our proposed method significantly reduced playtime required for participants to achieve specific objectives compared to traditional trial and error methods, indicating potential benefits for both casual and competitive gaming communities. Furthermore, our findings suggest the potential for utilizing similar approaches in other domains where visual observation plays a crucial role, opening up opportunities for future research. Overall, we believe our work presents a valuable contribution to enhancing the experience of playing explorati",1
"Advances in the field of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) have led to sophisticated inference frameworks that relax the original modeling assumption of observing an agent behavior that reflects only a single intention. Instead of learning a global behavioral model, recent IRL methods divide the demonstration data into parts, to account for the fact that different trajectories may correspond to different intentions, e.g., because they were generated by different domain experts. In this work, we go one step further: using the intuitive concept of subgoals, we build upon the premise that even a single trajectory can be explained more efficiently locally within a certain context than globally, enabling a more compact representation of the observed behavior. Based on this assumption, we build an implicit intentional model of the agent's goals to forecast its behavior in unobserved situations. The result is an integrated Bayesian prediction framework that significantly outperforms existing IRL solutions and provides smooth policy estimates consistent with the expert's plan. Most notably, our framework naturally handles situations where the intentions of the agent change over time and classical IRL algorithms fail. In addition, due to its probabilistic nature, the model can be straightforwardly applied in active learning scenarios to guide the demonstration process of the expert.",0
"Abstract: In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), the goal is to recover human preferences from observations of their behavior. Traditional IRL methods suffer from limitations such as model misspecification and sensitivity to initialization. To overcome these issues, we propose using nonparametric spatio-temporal subgoals models for IRL. This approach allows us to capture complex interactions between actions and states without making strong assumptions about the underlying model structure. We show that our method outperforms traditional IRL techniques on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our results suggest that combining nonparametric modeling with deep learning can improve performance in challenging domains where previous approaches have struggled.

"Microfluidic devices are utilized to control and direct flow behavior in a wide variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics. A particularly popular form of microfluidics -- called inertial microfluidic flow sculpting -- involves placing a sequence of pillars to controllably deform an initial flow field into a desired one. Inertial flow sculpting can be formally defined as an inverse problem, where one identifies a sequence of pillars (chosen, with replacement, from a finite set of pillars, each of which produce a specific transformation) whose composite transformation results in a user-defined desired transformation. Endemic to most such problems in engineering, inverse problems are usually quite computationally intractable, with most traditional approaches based on search and optimization strategies. In this paper, we pose this inverse problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We train a DoubleDQN agent to learn from this environment. The results suggest that learning is possible using a DoubleDQN model with the success frequency reaching 90% in 200,000 episodes and the rewards converging. While most of the results are obtained by fixing a particular target flow shape to simplify the learning problem, we later demonstrate how to transfer the learning of an agent based on one target shape to another, i.e. from one design to another and thus be useful for a generic design of a flow shape.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to designing microfluidic devices using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or manual trial and error, which can be time-consuming and may lead to suboptimal solutions. Our proposed method uses DRL algorithms to learn optimal flow shapes directly from simulation data, resulting in more efficient designs that minimize fluid resistance and power consumption. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several benchmark cases and showing significant improvements over existing methods. Additionally, we provide insights into how different design parameters impact flow shape optimization and suggest future directions for improving the reliability and generalization capabilities of our model. Overall, this work represents a step forward towards automating the design process of microfluidic devices and facilitates their integration into real-world applications such as lab-on-a-chip systems.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results in a variety of domains, learning directly from high-dimensional sensory streams. However, when neural networks are trained in a fixed environment, such as a single level in a video game, they will usually overfit and fail to generalize to new levels. When RL models overfit, even slight modifications to the environment can result in poor agent performance. This paper explores how procedurally generated levels during training can increase generality. We show that for some games procedural level generation enables generalization to new levels within the same distribution. Additionally, it is possible to achieve better performance with less data by manipulating the difficulty of the levels in response to the performance of the agent. The generality of the learned behaviors is also evaluated on a set of human-designed levels. The results suggest that the ability to generalize to human-designed levels highly depends on the design of the level generators. We apply dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to visualize the generators' distributions of levels and analyze to what degree they can produce levels similar to those designed by a human.",0
"Title: ""Illuminating Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning through Procedural Level Generation"" Paper Abstract In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most powerful tools in artificial intelligence due to its ability to learn complex behaviors from raw sensory input. However, DRL algorithms often suffer from poor generalization performance, meaning they struggle to adapt to new environments even when these environments share similar characteristics with those seen during training. To address this issue, we propose the use of procedurally generated levels as a means of evaluating DRL algorithm generalization. By generating levels on-the-fly using simple rules, we can create diverse sets of levels that cover more varied conditions than typical handcrafted level design. We evaluate two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), across multiple environments generated by our system, finding that both algorithms exhibit improved generalization performance compared to equivalent environments designed manually. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different parameter settings on generalization performance, identifying certain hyperparameters that contribute positively towards better cross-environment transferability. Our work demonstrates how procedural generation can serve as a valuable tool for understanding and improving DRL algorithm generalization capabilities. With further refinement and development, this technique could potentially become indispensable within the field of artificial intelligence research and beyond.",1
"We address reinforcement learning problems with finite state and action spaces where the underlying MDP has some known structure that could be potentially exploited to minimize the exploration rates of suboptimal (state, action) pairs. For any arbitrary structure, we derive problem-specific regret lower bounds satisfied by any learning algorithm. These lower bounds are made explicit for unstructured MDPs and for those whose transition probabilities and average reward functions are Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. the state and action. For Lipschitz MDPs, the bounds are shown not to scale with the sizes $S$ and $A$ of the state and action spaces, i.e., they are smaller than $c\log T$ where $T$ is the time horizon and the constant $c$ only depends on the Lipschitz structure, the span of the bias function, and the minimal action sub-optimality gap. This contrasts with unstructured MDPs where the regret lower bound typically scales as $SA\log T$. We devise DEL (Directed Exploration Learning), an algorithm that matches our regret lower bounds. We further simplify the algorithm for Lipschitz MDPs, and show that the simplified version is still able to efficiently exploit the structure.",0
"This paper presents an exploratory study into structured reinforcement learning (SRL), which refers to the application of RL algorithms to problems that exhibit some inherent structure.

Ultimately, we aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of SRL approaches across a range of scenarios, paving the way for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"Initial DR studies mainly adopt model predictive control and thus require accurate models of the control problem (e.g., a customer behavior model), which are to a large extent uncertain for the EV scenario. Hence, model-free approaches, especially based on reinforcement learning (RL) are an attractive alternative. In this paper, we propose a new Markov decision process (MDP) formulation in the RL framework, to jointly coordinate a set of EV charging stations. State-of-the-art algorithms either focus on a single EV, or perform the control of an aggregate of EVs in multiple steps (e.g., aggregate load decisions in one step, then a step translating the aggregate decision to individual connected EVs). On the contrary, we propose an RL approach to jointly control the whole set of EVs at once. We contribute a new MDP formulation, with a scalable state representation that is independent of the number of EV charging stations. Further, we use a batch reinforcement learning algorithm, i.e., an instance of fitted Q-iteration, to learn the optimal charging policy. We analyze its performance using simulation experiments based on a real-world EV charging data. More specifically, we (i) explore the various settings in training the RL policy (e.g., duration of the period with training data), (ii) compare its performance to an oracle all-knowing benchmark (which provides an upper bound for performance, relying on information that is not available or at least imperfect in practice), (iii) analyze performance over time, over the course of a full year to evaluate possible performance fluctuations (e.g, across different seasons), and (iv) demonstrate the generalization capacity of a learned control policy to larger sets of charging stations.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating electric vehicle (EV) charging using model-free reinforcement learning techniques. EVs pose unique challenges to power grids due to their intermittent nature and potentially large numbers. Traditional grid management methods struggle to handle these uncertainties and variability effectively, so new approaches like ours are necessary. Our method learns from trial-and-error interactions with the real system rather than relying on detailed models. We evaluated our technique through simulations, demonstrating that it can efficiently coordinate multiple EVs while minimizing disruption to grid operations. Results showed significant improvements over baseline scenarios without such coordination, as well as other state-of-the-art optimization strategies. Thus, our work shows promise for enabling widespread adoption of EV technology while maintaining grid stability and efficiency.",1
"To overcome the curse of dimensionality and curse of modeling in Dynamic Programming (DP) methods for solving classical Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are popular. In this paper, we consider an infinite-horizon average reward MDP problem and prove the optimality of the threshold policy under certain conditions. Traditional RL techniques do not exploit the threshold nature of optimal policy while learning. In this paper, we propose a new RL algorithm which utilizes the known threshold structure of the optimal policy while learning by reducing the feasible policy space. We establish that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal policy. It provides a significant improvement in convergence speed and computational and storage complexity over traditional RL algorithms. The proposed technique can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems that include energy efficient data transmission and management of queues. We exhibit the improvement in convergence speed of the proposed algorithm over other RL algorithms through simulations.",0
"This is an exciting new approach that combines online learning and Markov decision processes (MDPs) while taking into account structure awareness in order to improve efficiency and performance. By incorporating structural knowledge of MDPs such as transition probabilities and reward functions, we can develop algorithms that adapt faster and perform better than existing methods without sacrificing optimality guarantees. Our algorithm builds upon prior work by adding an additional layer of structure-awareness to enable more efficient exploration and balance exploitation. We demonstrate empirically on both synthetic benchmark problems and real-world applications that our method outperforms previous approaches across different domains and settings. With this breakthrough technique, researchers now have a powerful tool at their disposal to solve complex decision making tasks under uncertainty with confidence. Overall, the future looks promising for applying these techniques to a wide range of applications including robotics, finance, and healthcare.",1
"Goal-oriented dialog has been given attention due to its numerous applications in artificial intelligence. Goal-oriented dialogue tasks occur when a questioner asks an action-oriented question and an answerer responds with the intent of letting the questioner know a correct action to take. To ask the adequate question, deep learning and reinforcement learning have been recently applied. However, these approaches struggle to find a competent recurrent neural questioner, owing to the complexity of learning a series of sentences. Motivated by theory of mind, we propose ""Answerer in Questioner's Mind"" (AQM), a novel information theoretic algorithm for goal-oriented dialog. With AQM, a questioner asks and infers based on an approximated probabilistic model of the answerer. The questioner figures out the answerer's intention via selecting a plausible question by explicitly calculating the information gain of the candidate intentions and possible answers to each question. We test our framework on two goal-oriented visual dialog tasks: ""MNIST Counting Dialog"" and ""GuessWhat?!"". In our experiments, AQM outperforms comparative algorithms by a large margin.",0
"This paper presents an approach to goal-oriented visual dialog that models human conversational behavior by leveraging information theory.

Experiments demonstrate our system outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics and shows improvements in both objective accuracy and subjective measures. Additionally, we provide qualitative analysis showcasing how our method leads to more natural and informative interactions compared to alternative methods. These results highlight the potential of applying principles from information theory to build more intelligent systems capable of navigating complex environments.",1
"In this paper, we study the problem of learning vision-based dynamic manipulation skills using a scalable reinforcement learning approach. We study this problem in the context of grasping, a longstanding challenge in robotic manipulation. In contrast to static learning behaviors that choose a grasp point and then execute the desired grasp, our method enables closed-loop vision-based control, whereby the robot continuously updates its grasp strategy based on the most recent observations to optimize long-horizon grasp success. To that end, we introduce QT-Opt, a scalable self-supervised vision-based reinforcement learning framework that can leverage over 580k real-world grasp attempts to train a deep neural network Q-function with over 1.2M parameters to perform closed-loop, real-world grasping that generalizes to 96% grasp success on unseen objects. Aside from attaining a very high success rate, our method exhibits behaviors that are quite distinct from more standard grasping systems: using only RGB vision-based perception from an over-the-shoulder camera, our method automatically learns regrasping strategies, probes objects to find the most effective grasps, learns to reposition objects and perform other non-prehensile pre-grasp manipulations, and responds dynamically to disturbances and perturbations.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training robots to perform complex manipulation tasks in high-dimensional state spaces. However, applying these algorithms to vision-based robotic manipulation poses significant challenges due to the large number of possible actions and the need to learn from sparse rewards. To address these issues, we propose QT-Opt, a novel approach that combines quantum evolutionary computation and model-free reinforcement learning.  QT-Opt uses a population of candidate policies represented by low-precision quantum circuits, which are evolved using a variant of the Quantum Natural Evolution Strategy algorithm. These circuits encode parameters for both a value function estimator and a policy optimization objective, which together optimize a composite cost that incorporates both return prediction error and proximity to previously evaluated options. During evaluation, each circuit is executed repeatedly on rollouts generated from random initial states, allowing us to evaluate multiple trajectories concurrently without requiring excessive compute resources.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on three vision-based manipulation tasks involving blocks worlds, KUKA LWR robots, and real-world scenarios with MuJoCo locomotion. Our results show that QT-Opt outperforms alternative methods based on either parameterized policies or traditional neural network architectures, achieving significantly higher returns and better generalization across different levels of challenge in all tested environments. Furthermore, we showcase how QT-Opt can scale up to more complex problems, such as pushing a chair towards a goal position while avoiding obstacles, which proved difficult for other approaches to solve.  In conclusion, our work represents a promising step toward developing efficient and scalable deep reinforcement learning algorithms tailored for vision-ba",1
"Learning to control an environment without hand-crafted rewards or expert data remains challenging and is at the frontier of reinforcement learning research. We present an unsupervised learning algorithm to train agents to achieve perceptually-specified goals using only a stream of observations and actions. Our agent simultaneously learns a goal-conditioned policy and a goal achievement reward function that measures how similar a state is to the goal state. This dual optimization leads to a co-operative game, giving rise to a learned reward function that reflects similarity in controllable aspects of the environment instead of distance in the space of observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent to learn, in an unsupervised manner, to reach a diverse set of goals on three domains -- Atari, the DeepMind Control Suite and DeepMind Lab.",0

Experiments on challenging tasks show that our approach enables efficient and effective policy improvement, outperforming prior unsupervised techniques and even some fully supervised baselines on certain domains. This suggests the potential of leveraging low-cost feedback in practice to learn agents that better align with user goals, particularly when hand annotations may be scarce or costly to obtain.",1
"With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), an increasing number of energy harvesting methods are being used to supplement or supplant battery based sensors. Energy harvesting sensors need to be configured according to the application, hardware, and environmental conditions to maximize their usefulness. As of today, the configuration of sensors is either manual or heuristics based, requiring valuable domain expertise. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to automate configuration and efficiently scale IoT deployments, but it is not yet adopted in practice. We propose solutions to bridge this gap: reduce the training phase of RL so that nodes are operational within a short time after deployment and reduce the computational requirements to scale to large deployments. We focus on configuration of the sampling rate of indoor solar panel based energy harvesting sensors. We created a simulator based on 3 months of data collected from 5 sensor nodes subject to different lighting conditions. Our simulation results show that RL can effectively learn energy availability patterns and configure the sampling rate of the sensor nodes to maximize the sensing data while ensuring that energy storage is not depleted. The nodes can be operational within the first day by using our methods. We show that it is possible to reduce the number of RL policies by using a single policy for nodes that share similar lighting conditions.",0
"Increasing energy efficiency and reducing power consumption in computing systems have become important goals due to concerns over climate change and increasing demand on natural resources. One approach to achieving these goals is through energy harvesting sensors which convert ambient energy sources into usable electrical power. However, configuring these systems can pose significant challenges as it requires finding the optimal configuration parameters that maximize performance while minimizing power consumption. This paper presents a novel method using reinforcement learning (RL) to scale up the problem from single sensor configurations to multi-sensor scenarios. Our model builds upon recent advances in deep RL algorithms by incorporating domain knowledge specific to energy harvesting sensors to improve sample efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive simulations and show how it outperforms state-of-the art methods in terms of convergence speed, power savings, and solution quality. By enabling efficient scaling, our work provides insights for solving similar problems in other domains where configuration search spaces grow exponentially with system size.

This approach uses substantially fewer model steps per atom than earlier approaches, thus enabling generation of larger molecules, and beats previous state-of-the art baselines by a significant margin. Applying reinforcement learning to a combination of a custom context-free grammar with additional masking to enforce non-local constraints is applicable to any optimization of a graph structure under a mixture of local and nonlocal constraints.",0
"Here is an example of an abstract that meets your requirements:  Molecular optimization is an important task in chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry.

Each iteration can lead to improvements but requires significant time and resources. Grammatical representations offer one possible strategy to accelerate molecular optimization by providing a compact description of chemical structures that can be rapidly searched to identify candidate compounds for experimental testing. In this work, we demonstrate how grammatical representations can be combined with reinforcement learning algorithms to efficiently search large chemical spaces and identify optimized molecules. We apply these methods to several case studies including the design of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and battery electrolyte solvents, where our approaches yield improved performance compared to existing strategies. Our results highlight the potential of integrating grammars and machine learning techniques for efficient molecular optimization.",1
"Incorporating various modes of information into the machine learning procedure is becoming a new trend. And data from various source can provide more information than single one no matter they are heterogeneous or homogeneous. Existing deep learning based algorithms usually directly concatenate features from each domain to represent the input data. Seldom of them take the quality of data into consideration which is a key issue in related multimodal problems. In this paper, we propose an efficient quality-aware deep neural network to model the weight of data from each domain using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, we take the weighting of each domain as a decision-making problem and teach an agent learn to interact with the environment. The agent can tune the weight of each domain through discrete action selection and obtain a positive reward if the saliency results are improved. The target of the agent is to achieve maximum rewards after finished its sequential action selection. We validate the proposed algorithms on multimodal saliency detection in a coarse-to-fine way. The coarse saliency maps are generated from an encoder-decoder framework which is trained with content loss and adversarial loss. The final results can be obtained via adaptive weighting of maps from each domain. Experiments conducted on two kinds of salient object detection benchmarks validated the effectiveness of our proposed quality-aware deep neural network.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing saliency detection techniques that can effectively capture multimodal attention patterns across different types of data such as images, videos, audio, text, etc. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted features or supervised learning methods which may lead to suboptimal performance due to limited flexibility and scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a quality-aware deep reinforcement learning framework for multimodal saliency detection. Our approach learns to predict high-quality saliency maps directly from raw input data through self-supervision, without any manual annotations required during training. We define multiple intrinsic reward functions based on domain knowledge and feedback signals derived from human preferences to optimize different aspects of saliency prediction simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines under various evaluation metrics. By providing interpretable decision making policies, the proposed model offers promising insights into understanding how humans perceive attention-grabbing contents across different modalities. This work paves the way towards more advanced applications in content creation, personalized recommendation systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.",1

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a field that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to solve complex tasks efficiently using deep neural networks. In DRL, agents learn by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. This process allows agents to adapt and improve over time, leading to better decision making and problem solving abilities.  The main challenge in DRL lies in finding efficient ways of exploring state spaces that can span large portions of the agent's lifespan. To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed a variety of approaches such as curiosity-driven exploration, intrinsic motivation, and self-play. These methods aim to increase the efficiency and stability of DRL algorithms while reducing computational requirements.  In this paper, we provide an overview of DRL and its applications across different domains. We discuss some of the fundamental concepts underlying DRL algorithms, including Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradient methods, and actor-critic architectures. Additionally, we review the most popular models used in DRL, such as Deep Q Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C).

"In this work, we present our various contributions to the objective of building a decision support tool for the diagnosis of rare diseases. Our goal is to achieve a state of knowledge where the uncertainty about the patient's disease is below a predetermined threshold. We aim to reach such states while minimizing the average number of medical tests to perform. In doing so, we take into account the need, in many medical applications, to avoid, as much as possible, any misdiagnosis. To solve this optimization task, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithm and make them operable in our high-dimensional and sparse-reward setting. We also present a way to combine expert knowledge, expressed as conditional probabilities, with real clinical data. This is crucial because the scarcity of data in the field of rare diseases prevents any approach based solely on clinical data. Finally we show that it is possible to integrate the ontological information about symptoms while remaining in our probabilistic reasoning. It enables our decision support tool to process information given at different level of precision by the user.",0

"We demonstrate the use of conditional autoregressive generative models (van den Oord et al., 2016a) over a discrete latent space (van den Oord et al., 2017b) for forward planning with MCTS. In order to test this method, we introduce a new environment featuring varying difficulty levels, along with moving goals and obstacles. The combination of high-quality frame generation and classical planning approaches nearly matches true environment performance for our task, demonstrating the usefulness of this method for model-based planning in dynamic environments.",0
"This paper proposes novel methods for planning under uncertainty using conditional autoregressive models (CAMs). In dynamic environments where outcomes are partially observable and stochastic, traditional planning algorithms struggle due to the curse of dimensionality and intractability of computational search. We present CAMs as a solution that leverages recent advances in deep learning for efficient inference while modeling complex dependencies between actions and states. Our approach uses Bayesian updates to maintain a distribution over latent variables representing beliefs about unobservable aspects of the environment such as agent positions or opponent decisions. By doing so, our method can provide more accurate predictions at reduced computational cost compared to existing methods based on Monte Carlo tree search or rollouts. Additionally, we show how to incorporate domain knowledge through prior distributions to improve predictive accuracy and scalability further. Empirical evaluations on gridworld tasks with partial observability demonstrate significant advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art alternatives.",1
"Generating long and coherent reports to describe medical images poses challenges to bridging visual patterns with informative human linguistic descriptions. We propose a novel Hybrid Retrieval-Generation Reinforced Agent (HRGR-Agent) which reconciles traditional retrieval-based approaches populated with human prior knowledge, with modern learning-based approaches to achieve structured, robust, and diverse report generation. HRGR-Agent employs a hierarchical decision-making procedure. For each sentence, a high-level retrieval policy module chooses to either retrieve a template sentence from an off-the-shelf template database, or invoke a low-level generation module to generate a new sentence. HRGR-Agent is updated via reinforcement learning, guided by sentence-level and word-level rewards. Experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on two medical report datasets, generating well-balanced structured sentences with robust coverage of heterogeneous medical report contents. In addition, our model achieves the highest detection accuracy of medical terminologies, and improved human evaluation performance.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to generate natural language text based on input data. One particularly promising application area for such systems is medical image report generation, where trained human radiologists spend significant time writing reports from scratch to describe patient images. Previous work has shown that AI systems can effectively assist human authors by proposing candidate sentences or phrases that they may wish to incorporate into their final reports. However, most existing models have focused exclusively either on retrieval techniques - which suggest pre-existing text snippets as candidates - or generative methods, which propose novel output directly. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines elements of both classes of system, seeking to leverage the complementary strengths of each while mitigating their respective weaknesses. By grounding our work in a well-established task involving CT scans of patients with pneumonia, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model across three different metrics: automatic summarization accuracy, user preference studies comparing generated outputs against strong benchmark alternatives, and direct comparison against four other leading models using the same evaluation datasets and protocol. We demonstrate consistent gains over all baseline approaches and discuss future directions for research to further refine this exciting and impactful line of inquiry.",1
"Recent machine learning models have shown that including attention as a component results in improved model accuracy and interpretability, despite the concept of attention in these approaches only loosely approximating the brain's attention mechanism. Here we extend this work by building a more brain-inspired deep network model of the primate ATTention Network (ATTNet) that learns to shift its attention so as to maximize the reward. Using deep reinforcement learning, ATTNet learned to shift its attention to the visual features of a target category in the context of a search task. ATTNet's dorsal layers also learned to prioritize these shifts of attention so as to maximize success of the ventral pathway classification and receive greater reward. Model behavior was tested against the fixations made by subjects searching images for the same cued category. Both subjects and ATTNet showed evidence for attention being preferentially directed to target goals, behaviorally measured as oculomotor guidance to targets. More fundamentally, ATTNet learned to shift its attention to target like objects and spatially route its visual inputs to accomplish the task. This work makes a step toward a better understanding of the role of attention in the brain and other computational systems.",0
"Here we describe how multi-head self attention can enable learning to attend to different representations by conditioning on arbitrary objects at any position, as well as attending over multiple positions using relative attention (relative embeddings). The resulting architecture is trained end-to-end without supervision on attention weights: while initializing attention heads uniformly along the sequence yields poor performance, our proposed initialization method obtains good results comparable to other architectures which learn to attend through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or supervised learning. We show that even just adding random noise to the initialized attention head weights during training helps them discover meaningful attention patterns. Additionally, stacking up such units and training end-to-end provides improved accuracy compared to using a single unit, providing an efficient alternative to existing methods that rely on manually designed attention mechanisms. Our work suggests that simple modifications of standard multi-layer perceptrons allow for learning to attend in deep neural networks.",1
"Predicting the structure of a protein from its sequence is a cornerstone task of molecular biology. Established methods in the field, such as homology modeling and fragment assembly, appeared to have reached their limit. However, this year saw the emergence of promising new approaches: end-to-end protein structure and dynamics models, as well as reinforcement learning applied to protein folding. For these approaches to be investigated on a larger scale, an efficient implementation of their key computational primitives is required. In this paper we present a library of differentiable mappings from two standard dihedral-angle representations of protein structure (full-atom representation ""$\phi,\psi,\omega,\chi$"" and backbone-only representation ""$\phi,\psi,\omega$"") to atomic Cartesian coordinates. The source code and documentation can be found at https://github.com/lupoglaz/TorchProteinLibrary.",0
"Proteins play a vital role in many cellular processes within living organisms. In recent years, there has been significant progress in computational modeling techniques that aim to predict how these proteins fold into specific three-dimensional structures, which can inform our understanding of their function. However, existing representations of protein structures often require significant computational resources, limiting their application in large-scale simulations and machine learning tasks. To address this issue, we present TorchProteinLibrary, a new open source library that provides a highly optimizable and scalable approach based on the popular deep learning framework PyTorch. By utilizing advanced neural network architectures and techniques from computer graphics, TorchProteinLibrary enables researchers to quickly generate smooth and detailed models of complex protein molecules while remaining computationally efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate these models into state-of-the-art applications, such as generative design of novel protein sequences and predictive modeling of binding affinity to small molecule ligands. Overall, TorchProteinLibrary represents a powerful toolset for computational biologists, biochemical engineers, and other professionals involved in drug discovery and development.",1
"Sepsis is a dangerous condition that is a leading cause of patient mortality. Treating sepsis is highly challenging, because individual patients respond very differently to medical interventions and there is no universally agreed-upon treatment for sepsis. In this work, we explore the use of continuous state-space model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to discover high-quality treatment policies for sepsis patients. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that by blending the treatment strategy discovered with RL with what clinicians follow, we can obtain improved policies, potentially allowing for better medical treatment for sepsis.",0
"In sepsis treatment, time is crucial as early intervention can make a big difference in patient outcomes. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and timely administration of antibiotics are essential steps towards effective management of this life-threatening condition. As a result, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment decisions in the context of sepsis care. One such approach is model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), which combines predictive models with sequential decision making to inform the most optimal course of action given a set of observations. This paper proposes MBRL as a novel framework that holds great promise in improving sepsis outcome through better-informed clinical practice by integrating heterogeneous data sources into a single platform. By demonstrating its effectiveness on real-world datasets from both clinical trials and retrospective cohort studies, we show that MBRL can provide clinicians with a powerful tool to guide their decision making across multiple stages of sepsis progression. We believe our work provides a foundation for future research towards personalized medicine where individual patients’ characteristics, comorbidities, and response to therapy can further refine these predictions and support physician discretion in complex medical scenarios.",1
"In hierarchical reinforcement learning a major challenge is determining appropriate low-level policies. We propose an unsupervised learning scheme, based on asymmetric self-play from Sukhbaatar et al. (2018), that automatically learns a good representation of sub-goals in the environment and a low-level policy that can execute them. A high-level policy can then direct the lower one by generating a sequence of continuous sub-goal vectors. We evaluate our model using Mazebase and Mujoco environments, including the challenging AntGather task. Visualizations of the sub-goal embeddings reveal a logical decomposition of tasks within the environment. Quantitatively, our approach obtains compelling performance gains over non-hierarchical approaches.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches towards achieving human-level intelligence in artificial agents. However, training DRL algorithms remains challenging due to the difficulty of efficiently exploring large action spaces and estimating action values over extended time horizons. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that leverages self-play and goal embeddings to learn hierarchical representations of actions and goals in continuous state spaces. Our approach builds upon recent advances in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by representing goals using dense embeddings that capture their semantic meaning, allowing us to efficiently explore complex action sequences that achieve desired outcomes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark tasks, including both discrete and continuous environments, showing that our agent can rapidly solve difficult problems that are beyond the reach of traditional RL methods. Overall, our results provide important insights into how neural networks can represent hierarchical knowledge structures in order to facilitate efficient decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Machine learning applications in medical imaging are frequently limited by the lack of quality labeled data. In this paper, we explore the self training method, a form of semi-supervised learning, to address the labeling burden. By integrating reinforcement learning, we were able to expand the application of self training to complex segmentation networks without any further human annotation. The proposed approach, reinforced self training (ReST), fine tunes a semantic segmentation networks by introducing a policy network that learns to generate pseudolabels. We incorporate an expert demonstration network, based on inverse reinforcement learning, to enhance clinical validity and convergence of the policy network. The model was tested on a pulmonary nodule segmentation task in chest X-rays and achieved the performance of a standard U-Net while using only 50% of the labeled data, by exploiting unlabeled data. When the same number of labeled data was used, a moderate to significant cross validation accuracy improvement was achieved depending on the absolute number of labels used.",0
"Artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly improve medical imaging techniques by automating tasks such as pulmonary nodule segmentation. In order to achieve accurate results, researchers have sought to integrate reinforcement learning into self training methods. This integration allows the model to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data while taking advantage of the strengths of each method. The authors propose two approaches: semi-supervised learning using auxiliary tasks and adversarial training with cycle consistency constraints. Both approaches were tested on datasets of chest x-ray images and showed improved performance over traditional supervised learning alone. Overall, the combination of reinforcement learning and self training represents a promising direction for improving pulmonary nodule segmentation in medical imaging.",1
"We propose a framework for ensuring safe behavior of a reinforcement learning agent when the reward function may be difficult to specify. In order to do this, we rely on the existence of demonstrations from expert policies, and we provide a theoretical framework for the agent to optimize in the space of rewards consistent with its existing knowledge. We propose two methods to solve the resulting optimization: an exact ellipsoid-based method and a method in the spirit of the ""follow-the-perturbed-leader"" algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the behavior of our algorithm in both discrete and continuous problems. The trained agent safely avoids states with potential negative effects while imitating the behavior of the expert in the other states.",0
"This is one of many papers that aim at understanding how humans would like machines to act: by specifying safety constraints on behavior, using real human feedback, in order to learn better behaviors more efficiently than traditional trial and error methods. To study these questions, we conduct large-scale online experiments with thousands of participants drawn from diverse populations. We investigate what specific types of constraint satisfaction are most effective in guiding machine learning systems towards safe policies for complex tasks that involve physical agents interacting with their environment, as well as how user preferences for safety vs. competence change with different backgrounds (e.g., age, education). Ultimately our work supports the development of next generation AI systems that can safely collaborate with users even as they continue to improve over time via online learning from human feedback. This research represents a significant step forward towards addressing concerns about ensuring beneficial AI outcomes that align with human values and promoting responsible innovation across all applications of technology.",1
"We consider the problem of high-level strategy selection in the adversarial setting of real-time strategy games from a reinforcement learning perspective, where taking an action corresponds to switching to the respective strategy. Here, a good strategy successfully counters the opponent's current and possible future strategies which can only be estimated using partial observations. We investigate whether we can utilize the full game state information during training time (in the form of an auxiliary prediction task) to increase performance. Experiments carried out within a StarCraft: Brood War bot against strong community bots show substantial win rate improvements over a fixed-strategy baseline and encouraging results when learning with the auxiliary task.",0
"This paper presents an approach for high-level strategy selection in the game of StarCraft: Brood War under partial observability. The problem of selecting effective strategies in real-time strategy games like StarCraft is complicated by the fact that players have limited information about their opponents' resources and actions. To address this challenge, we propose a method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that incorporates domain knowledge to guide the search towards promising regions of the strategy space. Our approach includes a novel evaluation function that takes into account both the player's current state and their partial observability of the enemy's state. We evaluate our method through experiments against human players and compare its performance to other MCTS-based methods. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving expert level play even under conditions of severe partial observability. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in developing artificial intelligence agents capable of competing at a high level in complex real-time strategy games.",1
"We introduce Intelligent Annotation Dialogs for bounding box annotation. We train an agent to automatically choose a sequence of actions for a human annotator to produce a bounding box in a minimal amount of time. Specifically, we consider two actions: box verification, where the annotator verifies a box generated by an object detector, and manual box drawing. We explore two kinds of agents, one based on predicting the probability that a box will be positively verified, and the other based on reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that (1) our agents are able to learn efficient annotation strategies in several scenarios, automatically adapting to the image difficulty, the desired quality of the boxes, and the detector strength; (2) in all scenarios the resulting annotation dialogs speed up annotation compared to manual box drawing alone and box verification alone, while also outperforming any fixed combination of verification and drawing in most scenarios; (3) in a realistic scenario where the detector is iteratively re-trained, our agents evolve a series of strategies that reflect the shifting trade-off between verification and drawing as the detector grows stronger.",0
"In natural conversations, context often changes rapidly and unpredictably due to interruptions from the user. In response to these disruptive context switches, human annotators can adapt their responses intelligently using diverse strategies that involve updating memory traces that enable them to recover relevant discussions. This process allows annotators to complete tasks efficiently and effectively despite such interruptions. However, current machine learning approaches struggle to handle such dynamic interactions as they rely on static models with fixed architectures. Recognizing this gap between how humans manage multitasking compared to machines, we explore different ways that computer vision models can adapt to multiple concurrent contexts by proposing three novel strategies: explicit annotation reification, latent task decomposition, and progressively adaptive multi-branch model refinement. These innovative methods allow computer vison models to better replicate human annotations under interrupted and uncertain environments. Our results showcase improvements over prior work across four benchmark datasets while significantly reducing computational costs, illustrating the potential of our techniques. Overall, this research advances the state-of-the-art in intelligent dialogue systems by enabling computer vision models to operate more naturally like real annotators.",1
"This paper proposes a new optimization objective for value-based deep reinforcement learning. We extend conventional Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) by adding a model-learning component yielding a transcoder network. The prediction errors for the model are included in the basic DQN loss as additional regularizers. This augmented objective leads to a richer training signal that provides feedback at every time step. Moreover, because learning an environment model shares a common structure with the RL problem, we hypothesize that the resulting objective improves both sample efficiency and performance. We empirically confirm our hypothesis on a range of 20 games from the Atari benchmark attaining superior results over vanilla DQN without model-based regularization.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful approach to solving complex decision making problems across multiple domains. At the same time, training deep neural networks remains challenging due to issues like overfitting, lack of interpretability, brittleness, etc. To overcome these difficulties, model-based approaches have gained popularity, which use a lightweight generative model to learn a compact approximation of the environment dynamics, allowing for better exploration and generalization. In this work we introduce TransCoder, a novel architecture that combines transitive proximal policy optimization (TPPO) with a decoder network trained via maximum likelihood estimation on a latent state space learned from TPPO interactions. We show that our framework provides significant benefits compared to prior model based regularized RL methods. Our results suggest that combining both model predictive control and planning into one unified algorithm can lead to substantial improvements in sample efficiency, final performance, and robustness against hyperparameter variations such as batch size, learning rate and horizon. Finally, we demonstrate how TransCoder outperforms several strong baselines in five continuous control benchmark tasks: Swimmer, Hopper, Walker2D, Ant and Humanoid. These findings highlight the potential of our method as an important step towards developing more efficient and explainable algorithms for real-world applications.",1
"Representation learning of pedestrian trajectories transforms variable-length timestamp-coordinate tuples of a trajectory into a fixed-length vector representation that summarizes spatiotemporal characteristics. It is a crucial technique to connect feature-based data mining with trajectory data. Trajectory representation is a challenging problem, because both environmental constraints (e.g., wall partitions) and temporal user dynamics should be meticulously considered and accounted for. Furthermore, traditional sequence-to-sequence autoencoders using maximum log-likelihood often require dataset covering all the possible spatiotemporal characteristics to perform well. This is infeasible or impractical in reality. We propose TREP, a practical pedestrian trajectory representation learning algorithm which captures the environmental constraints and the pedestrian dynamics without the need of any training dataset. By formulating a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder with a spatial-aware objective function under the paradigm of actor-critic reinforcement learning, TREP intelligently encodes spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories with the capability of handling diverse trajectory patterns. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate the high fidelity of TREP to represent trajectories.",0
"This paper presents a new method for learning representations of pedestrian trajectories using an actor-critic sequence-to-sequence autoencoder (A2S2E). We use natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming and lemmatization on the dataset provided by the METRICS project and then build our model based on that data. Our proposed method allows us to learn richer, more accurate representations than other methods while still maintaining computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach by comparing the results against state-of-the-art baseline models both qualitatively and quantitatively, showing clear improvements in performance across all metrics used. We believe that our work represents an important step forward in understanding how to effectively represent and predict complex human movements.",1
"The broad set of deep generative models (DGMs) has achieved remarkable advances. However, it is often difficult to incorporate rich structured domain knowledge with the end-to-end DGMs. Posterior regularization (PR) offers a principled framework to impose structured constraints on probabilistic models, but has limited applicability to the diverse DGMs that can lack a Bayesian formulation or even explicit density evaluation. PR also requires constraints to be fully specified a priori, which is impractical or suboptimal for complex knowledge with learnable uncertain parts. In this paper, we establish mathematical correspondence between PR and reinforcement learning (RL), and, based on the connection, expand PR to learn constraints as the extrinsic reward in RL. The resulting algorithm is model-agnostic to apply to any DGMs, and is flexible to adapt arbitrary constraints with the model jointly. Experiments on human image generation and templated sentence generation show models with learned knowledge constraints by our algorithm greatly improve over base generative models.",0
"This paper presents a new method for improving the performance of deep generative models by incorporating learnable knowledge constraints. These constraints, which can be learned from data or provided manually, guide the generation process and allow the model to produce more coherent and semantically meaningful output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets, showing that it leads to significant improvements over baseline methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our work has important implications for natural language processing, as it shows how machine learning algorithms can be made more robust and interpretable through the use of domain-specific knowledge.",1
"Policy gradient methods are a widely used class of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms where a state-dependent baseline is used to reduce gradient estimator variance. Several recent papers extend the baseline to depend on both the state and action and suggest that this significantly reduces variance and improves sample efficiency without introducing bias into the gradient estimates. To better understand this development, we decompose the variance of the policy gradient estimator and numerically show that learned state-action-dependent baselines do not in fact reduce variance over a state-dependent baseline in commonly tested benchmark domains. We confirm this unexpected result by reviewing the open-source code accompanying these prior papers, and show that subtle implementation decisions cause deviations from the methods presented in the papers and explain the source of the previously observed empirical gains. Furthermore, the variance decomposition highlights areas for improvement, which we demonstrate by illustrating a simple change to the typical value function parameterization that can significantly improve performance.",0
"Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have had significant successes across many domains. However, one crucial aspect that has received limited attention is action-dependent baseline selection. Most RL models use some form of state value function, which determines how good it is to be in each possible state. This requires selecting a ""baseline"" value, which represents the quality of being in a given state regardless of whether an agent is taking actions. In practice, these baselines often depend on the actions taken by the agent. While such dependence seems reasonable at first glance, we show that it can create serious problems. Firstly, it makes the learned policies difficult to interpret, as they may appear to optimize for objectives other than maximizing expected reward. Secondly, we demonstrate that naive choice of action-dependent baselines can lead to poor performance and even instability in training. Finally, we propose novel techniques to mitigate these issues and establish new theoretical guarantees for both model-free and model-based RL algorithms. Our results highlight the importance of understanding and controlling for action-dependent baselines when designing RL systems. By addressing these challenges, our work helps pave the way towards more reliable and interpretable artificial intelligence agents.",1
"One obstacle to applying reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world problems is the lack of suitable reward functions. Designing such reward functions is difficult in part because the user only has an implicit understanding of the task objective. This gives rise to the agent alignment problem: how do we create agents that behave in accordance with the user's intentions? We outline a high-level research direction to solve the agent alignment problem centered around reward modeling: learning a reward function from interaction with the user and optimizing the learned reward function with reinforcement learning. We discuss the key challenges we expect to face when scaling reward modeling to complex and general domains, concrete approaches to mitigate these challenges, and ways to establish trust in the resulting agents.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of aligning artificial agents with human values, which has been identified as one of the key obstacles facing the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems. The proposed method uses machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model of human preferences that can be used by the agent to guide its actions and decisions. By using such models, we argue that it becomes possible to train and deploy agents that can effectively balance competing objectives and make tradeoffs between different interests in complex environments. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a range of experiments on simulated domains and real-world datasets. Overall, our results suggest that reward modeling represents a promising new direction for scalable agent alignment research, with significant implications for the design and deployment of next-generation intelligent systems.",1
"A* is a popular path-finding algorithm, but it can only be applied to those domains where a good heuristic function is known. Inspired by recent methods combining Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and trees, this study demonstrates how to train a heuristic represented by a DNN and combine it with A*. This new algorithm which we call aleph-star can be used efficiently in domains where the input to the heuristic could be processed by a neural network. We compare aleph-star to N-Step Deep Q-Learning (DQN Mnih et al. 2013) in a driving simulation with pixel-based input, and demonstrate significantly better performance in this scenario.",0
"Here's your new abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly popular as a method for training agents to make decisions in complex environments. In recent years, researchers have explored using informed search algorithms like A* to improve the efficiency of RL. However, these methods often require careful tuning of heuristics and parameter settings, which can be challenging and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines deep learning with A* search to create a highly efficient and effective reinforcement learning agent. Our method uses a convolutional neural network to learn a deep heuristic function that guides the search towards states that are likely to yield high rewards. By integrating the strengths of both A* and deep learning, our agent is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks. We evaluate our method on a range of continuous control problems and demonstrate its ability to find solutions significantly faster than previous approaches while achieving comparable levels of accuracy. Overall, our results showcase the potential of combining A* search with deep learning for improving the performance and scalability of RL algorithms.",1
"Learning to infer Bayesian posterior from a few-shot dataset is an important step towards robust meta-learning due to the model uncertainty inherent in the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian model-agnostic meta-learning method. The proposed method combines scalable gradient-based meta-learning with nonparametric variational inference in a principled probabilistic framework. During fast adaptation, the method is capable of learning complex uncertainty structure beyond a point estimate or a simple Gaussian approximation. In addition, a robust Bayesian meta-update mechanism with a new meta-loss prevents overfitting during meta-update. Remaining an efficient gradient-based meta-learner, the method is also model-agnostic and simple to implement. Experiment results show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in various tasks: sinusoidal regression, image classification, active learning, and reinforcement learning.",0
"In summary, I want you to write an abstract that provides a brief overview of the content presented in the paper without including any specific details from the paper like authors name etc. Make it as general as possible while highlighting key points discussed within the text. Model agnostic meta learning (MAML) has received significant attention in recent years due to its ability to rapidly learn new tasks by leveraging knowledge gained from previous experiences. However, traditional MAML methods often assume known models and ignore their uncertainties, which can lead to suboptimal performance on new tasks. To address these shortcomings, we propose Bayesian model-agnostic meta-learning (BayesMAML), a framework that incorporates uncertainty estimation into MAML algorithms. Our approach allows for more robust task adaptation by explicitly accounting for model uncertainties during training. We evaluate our method using extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art MAML techniques. Overall, our work presents a novel perspective on model-agnostic meta-learning, paving the way for further advancements in this active research area.",1
"In the quest for efficient and robust reinforcement learning methods, both model-free and model-based approaches offer advantages. In this paper we propose a new way of explicitly bridging both approaches via a shared low-dimensional learned encoding of the environment, meant to capture summarizing abstractions. We show that the modularity brought by this approach leads to good generalization while being computationally efficient, with planning happening in a smaller latent state space. In addition, this approach recovers a sufficient low-dimensional representation of the environment, which opens up new strategies for interpretable AI, exploration and transfer learning.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence. RL algorithms learn by trial and error to maximize rewards received from their environment. However, traditional RL methods have been limited due to high sample complexity and brittle solutions that depend heavily on problem specific features. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework for combined reinforcement learning via abstract representations (CRA). Our approach uses pre-trained abstract feature extractors that capture relevant aspects of the state space without relying on explicit modeling of the problem structure. We then use these abstract representations within efficient model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms to achieve significantly better performance than standard model-based baselines across a range of benchmark problems. Furthermore, our method achieves improved robustness against variations of the original environment while using substantially less data compared to prior methods. Overall, CRA represents a significant step forward towards scalable and effective RL solutions.",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning methods such as the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) have successfully applied in complex decision-making problems such as Atari games. However, these methods suffer from high variances and high sample complexity. On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning methods that learn the transition dynamics are more sample efficient, but they often suffer from the bias of the transition estimation. How to make use of both model-based and model-free learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present a new technique to address the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, which regards the difference between model-free and model-based estimations as a measure of exploration value. We apply this new technique to the PPO algorithm and arrive at a new policy optimization method, named Policy Optimization with Model-based Explorations (POME). POME uses two components to predict the actions' target values: a model-free one estimated by Monte-Carlo sampling and a model-based one which learns a transition model and predicts the value of the next state. POME adds the error of these two target estimations as the additional exploration value for each state-action pair, i.e, encourages the algorithm to explore the states with larger target errors which are hard to estimate. We compare POME with PPO on Atari 2600 games, and it shows that POME outperforms PPO on 33 games out of 49 games.",0
"Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled researchers to develop highly accurate models that can make complex predictions on large datasets. However, these models often require large amounts of training data and computational resources which makes them impractical for many real-world applications. In addition, the black box nature of these models makes it difficult to interpret their decision making process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method for policy optimization that combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based exploration. Our approach uses a deep neural network as a surrogate model to approximate the true environment dynamics, allowing us to efficiently explore different policies without having to interact directly with the environment. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark tasks including Atari games and robotic manipulation problems, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, by using interpretable models such as decision trees and linear regression, our approach enables transparent and explainable decision making, making it suitable for use in safety-critical domains like healthcare and finance.

"Deep Learning is increasingly being adopted by industry for computer vision applications running on embedded devices. While Convolutional Neural Networks' accuracy has achieved a mature and remarkable state, inference latency and throughput are a major concern especially when targeting low-cost and low-power embedded platforms. CNNs' inference latency may become a bottleneck for Deep Learning adoption by industry, as it is a crucial specification for many real-time processes. Furthermore, deployment of CNNs across heterogeneous platforms presents major compatibility issues due to vendor-specific technology and acceleration libraries. In this work, we present QS-DNN, a fully automatic search based on Reinforcement Learning which, combined with an inference engine optimizer, efficiently explores through the design space and empirically finds the optimal combinations of libraries and primitives to speed up the inference of CNNs on heterogeneous embedded devices. We show that, an optimized combination can achieve 45x speedup in inference latency on CPU compared to a dependency-free baseline and 2x on average on GPGPU compared to the best vendor library. Further, we demonstrate that, the quality of results and time ""to-solution"" is much better than with Random Search and achieves up to 15x better results for a short-time search.",0
"Inferring which neural network architecture to use in deep learning tasks has become increasingly important as more advanced models have been developed.

"Multi-agent learning provides a potential framework for learning and simulating traffic behaviors. This paper proposes a novel architecture to learn multiple driving behaviors in a traffic scenario. The proposed architecture can learn multiple behaviors independently as well as simultaneously. We take advantage of the homogeneity of agents and learn in a parameter sharing paradigm. To further speed up the training process asynchronous updates are employed into the architecture. While learning different behaviors simultaneously, the given framework was also able to learn cooperation between the agents, without any explicit communication. We applied this framework to learn two important behaviors in driving: 1) Lane-Keeping and 2) Over-Taking. Results indicate faster convergence and learning of a more generic behavior, that is scalable to any number of agents. When compared the results with existing approaches, our results indicate equal and even better performance in some cases.",0

"The class of Gaussian Process (GP) methods for Temporal Difference learning has shown promise for data-efficient model-free Reinforcement Learning. In this paper, we consider a recent variant of the GP-SARSA algorithm, called Sparse Pseudo-input Gaussian Process SARSA (SPGP-SARSA), and derive recursive formulas for its predictive moments. This extension promotes greater memory efficiency, since previous computations can be reused and, interestingly, it provides a technique for updating value estimates on a multiple timescales",0
"The purpose of Recursive Sparse Pseudo-Input Gaussian Processes (RecSPrGPP) was initially proposed as a method to reduce computational complexity when applying probabilistic models on large datasets.

The paper concludes by discussing potential future directions for researchers interested in developing novel applications using Recursive Sparse Pseudo-Input Gaussian Process SARSA.",1
"We investigate sparse representations for control in reinforcement learning. While these representations are widely used in computer vision, their prevalence in reinforcement learning is limited to sparse coding where extracting representations for new data can be computationally intensive. Here, we begin by demonstrating that learning a control policy incrementally with a representation from a standard neural network fails in classic control domains, whereas learning with a representation obtained from a neural network that has sparsity properties enforced is effective. We provide evidence that the reason for this is that the sparse representation provides locality, and so avoids catastrophic interference, and particularly keeps consistent, stable values for bootstrapping. We then discuss how to learn such sparse representations. We explore the idea of Distributional Regularizers, where the activation of hidden nodes is encouraged to match a particular distribution that results in sparse activation across time. We identify a simple but effective way to obtain sparse representations, not afforded by previously proposed strategies, making it more practical for further investigation into sparse representations for reinforcement learning.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successful in achieving human level performance on tasks such as Go and Atari games, but these methods often require large amounts of data and computational resources to train effectively. One way to improve the sample efficiency and generalization ability of DRL algorithms is through the use of sparse representations. In recent years, there have been several attempts to incorporate sparsity into deep RL, motivated by the observation that most states are irrelevant for determining optimal behavior. However, existing approaches face limitations such as excessive computation cost or poor performance due to insufficient exploration. This study proposes a novel method called ""Sparsely Exploring Agent"" (SEA), which integrates three key ideas: gradient-based pruning, adaptively adjusting exploration density, and exploiting prior knowledge from expert trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models across a wide range of continuous control tasks including Ant, Hopper, Walker2d, HalfCheetah, and Humanoid. By balancing exploration and exploitation during training, SEA effectively utilizes sparse representation to achieve better control policies with fewer samples compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results suggest that our approach can provide valuable guidance for designing efficient and effective sparse reinforcement learners.

"To solve complex real-world problems with reinforcement learning, we cannot rely on manually specified reward functions. Instead, we can have humans communicate an objective to the agent directly. In this work, we combine two approaches to learning from human feedback: expert demonstrations and trajectory preferences. We train a deep neural network to model the reward function and use its predicted reward to train an DQN-based deep reinforcement learning agent on 9 Atari games. Our approach beats the imitation learning baseline in 7 games and achieves strictly superhuman performance on 2 games without using game rewards. Additionally, we investigate the goodness of fit of the reward model, present some reward hacking problems, and study the effects of noise in the human labels.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to reinforcement learning that utilizes human preferences and demonstrations as rewards. Traditional methods of reward shaping have limitations such as potential shaping errors and distortion of optimal policies. By incorporating human feedback into the reward signal, we aim to overcome these issues and improve the quality of learned behavior. Our method takes advantage of both human supervision and environmental feedback by alternating between imitation learning and reinforcement learning phases. During imitation learning, the agent observes human demonstrations and learns to mimic them using inverse modeling techniques. In subsequent reinforcement learning episodes, the agent receives additional intrinsic rewards proportional to how well its behavior aligns with the inferred human preferences. We evaluate our approach on several challenging Atari domains and show that it outperforms previous methods of combining human feedback and extrinsic rewards. Additionally, we demonstrate the interpretability of our method by analyzing how different components of our reward function contribute to agent behavior. Overall, our work represents a step towards developing agents capable of effectively integrating human knowledge and autonomous decision making in complex tasks.",1
"Robustness is important for sequential decision making in a stochastic dynamic environment with uncertain probabilistic parameters. We address the problem of using robust MDPs (RMDPs) to compute policies with provable worst-case guarantees in reinforcement learning. The quality and robustness of an RMDP solution is determined by its ambiguity set. Existing methods construct ambiguity sets that lead to impractically conservative solutions. In this paper, we propose RSVF, which achieves less conservative solutions with the same worst-case guarantees by 1) leveraging a Bayesian prior, 2) optimizing the size and location of the ambiguity set, and, most importantly, 3) relaxing the requirement that the set is a confidence interval. Our theoretical analysis shows the safety of RSVF, and the empirical results demonstrate its practical promise.",0
"This paper presents a new method for constructing ambiguity sets in robust Markov decision processes (MDPs). In these models, uncertainty in transition probabilities and rewards can lead to suboptimal policies. Traditional approaches to dealing with this uncertainty involve constructing conservative ambiguity sets that may exclude potentially good solutions. Our proposed approach uses tight Bayesian ambiguity sets based on the posterior distribution over model parameters given data from similar environments. We show that our method leads to more accurate approximations of the true value function and results in improved policy performance compared to existing methods.",1
"Dealing with uncertainty is essential for efficient reinforcement learning. There is a growing literature on uncertainty estimation for deep learning from fixed datasets, but many of the most popular approaches are poorly-suited to sequential decision problems. Other methods, such as bootstrap sampling, have no mechanism for uncertainty that does not come from the observed data. We highlight why this can be a crucial shortcoming and propose a simple remedy through addition of a randomized untrainable `prior' network to each ensemble member. We prove that this approach is efficient with linear representations, provide simple illustrations of its efficacy with nonlinear representations and show that this approach scales to large-scale problems far better than previous attempts.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving sequential decision making problems in complex environments. However, due to the complexity of these models, finding effective ways to regularize them has become increasingly important. One promising approach that has gained attention in recent work is randomization of prior functions, which involves adding random noise to the model parameters during training to reduce overfitting. This method has been shown to improve generalization performance on a variety of tasks while maintaining competitive sample efficiency compared to other methods such as weight decay and dropout. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advances in using randomized priors for deep reinforcement learning, highlighting both theoretical results and empirical evaluations across different domains. We discuss key challenges and open questions related to the use of randomized priors and outline future directions for research in this area. Our aim is to provide readers with a clear understanding of the state-of-the-art techniques and inspire new research in this exciting field of study.",1
"Learning policies on data synthesized by models can in principle quench the thirst of reinforcement learning algorithms for large amounts of real experience, which is often costly to acquire. However, simulating plausible experience de novo is a hard problem for many complex environments, often resulting in biases for model-based policy evaluation and search. Instead of de novo synthesis of data, here we assume logged, real experience and model alternative outcomes of this experience under counterfactual actions, actions that were not actually taken. Based on this, we propose the Counterfactually-Guided Policy Search (CF-GPS) algorithm for learning policies in POMDPs from off-policy experience. It leverages structural causal models for counterfactual evaluation of arbitrary policies on individual off-policy episodes. CF-GPS can improve on vanilla model-based RL algorithms by making use of available logged data to de-bias model predictions. In contrast to off-policy algorithms based on Importance Sampling which re-weight data, CF-GPS leverages a model to explicitly consider alternative outcomes, allowing the algorithm to make better use of experience data. We find empirically that these advantages translate into improved policy evaluation and search results on a non-trivial grid-world task. Finally, we show that CF-GPS generalizes the previously proposed Guided Policy Search and that reparameterization-based algorithms such Stochastic Value Gradient can be interpreted as counterfactual methods.",0
"This work presents a new approach to reinforcement learning called ""Counterfactually-Guided Policy Search."" In contrast to traditional policy gradient methods, which learn policies directly by gradient ascent on some objective function like expected return, our method learns policies that counterfactually minimize regret by exploring alternative paths through the environment that might have led to higher returns than those achieved by the current policy. We demonstrate that Counterfactually-Guided Policy Search can outperform state-of-the-art policy gradient methods on several benchmark problems from the literature. Furthermore, we show how the resulting policies can guide efficient search over the space of all possible actions at each decision point. Our findings highlight the promise of using counterfactual reasoning to improve the effectiveness of planning algorithms in artificial intelligence.",1
"Policy gradient methods are very attractive in reinforcement learning due to their model-free nature and convergence guarantees. These methods, however, suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, resulting in poor sample efficiency. To mitigate this issue, a number of variance-reduction approaches have been proposed. Unfortunately, in the challenging problems with delayed rewards, these approaches either bring a relatively modest improvement or do reduce variance at expense of introducing a bias and undermining convergence. The unbiased methods of gradient estimation, in general, only partially reduce variance, without eliminating it completely even in the limit of exact knowledge of the value functions and problem dynamics, as one might have wished. In this work we propose an unbiased method that does completely eliminate variance under some, commonly encountered, conditions. Of practical interest is the limit of deterministic dynamics and small policy stochasticity. In the case of a quadratic value function, as in linear quadratic Gaussian models, the policy randomness need not be small. We use such a model to analyze performance of the proposed variance-elimination approach and compare it with standard variance-reduction methods. The core idea behind the approach is to use control variates at all future times down the trajectory. We present both a model-based and model-free formulations.",0
"In sequential decision making problems involving realistic scenarios, often there exists uncertainty about future outcomes that can cause significant variability in reward estimates from one time step to another. This variability leads to suboptimal policies as models make decisions based on incorrect assumptions due to these fluctuations. To mitigate such issues and achieve more accurate estimations, we propose a new algorithm called REVEAL (Reward Estimation Variance Elimination via Adaptive Leverage) which effectively removes noise associated with reward estimation uncertainty by leveraging past observations during each iteration of policy improvement. Our approach draws inspiration from both offline dynamic programming methods that eliminate noise through averaging solutions over time, and online model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms using neural networks that use temporal difference errors for updates. Experiments show improved results compared to benchmark baselines and demonstrate how our method achieves better performance by reducing estimate variances while improving sample efficiency.

"Deep reinforcement learning techniques have demonstrated superior performance in a wide variety of environments. As improvements in training algorithms continue at a brisk pace, theoretical or empirical studies on understanding what these networks seem to learn, are far behind. In this paper we propose an interpretable neural network architecture for Q-learning which provides a global explanation of the model's behavior using key-value memories, attention and reconstructible embeddings. With a directed exploration strategy, our model can reach training rewards comparable to the state-of-the-art deep Q-learning models. However, results suggest that the features extracted by the neural network are extremely shallow and subsequent testing using out-of-sample examples shows that the agent can easily overfit to trajectories seen during training.",0
"Recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning have produced powerful algorithms capable of achieving human-level performance on complex tasks. However, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult for humans to understand how they make decisions and interact with their environment. In this work, we propose a methodology towards improving the interpretability of deep Q-networks (DQNs), which constitute one of the most widely used models in the field. Our approach relies on visualization techniques that provide insights into both the value function and policy learned by the model, allowing researchers and practitioners to better comprehend DQN behavior. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in multiple domains, including continuous control problems and text generation tasks. Overall, our contributions pave the way for building more transparent artificial intelligence systems that align better with human expectations and values.",1
"Deep neural networks have shown superior performance in many regimes to remember familiar patterns with large amounts of data. However, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm is still limited when facing the need to learn new concepts efficiently from scarce data. In this paper, we present a memory-augmented neural network which is motivated by the process of human concept learning. The training procedure, imitating the concept formation course of human, learns how to distinguish samples from different classes and aggregate samples of the same kind. In order to better utilize the advantages originated from the human behavior, we propose a sequential process, during which the network should decide how to remember each sample at every step. In this sequential process, a stable and interactive memory serves as an important module. We validate our model in some typical one-shot learning tasks and also an exploratory outlier detection problem. In all the experiments, our model gets highly competitive to reach or outperform those strong baselines.",0
"Our model uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in conjunction with memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) to learn new concepts quickly from raw data streams. DRL enables efficient exploration of high-dimensional action spaces by learning a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time. MANNs enable both short-term memorization and incremental rehearsal of recent experiences in the form of context vectors stored within the network. By combining these two techniques, our approach can efficiently adapt to rapidly changing environments and overcome catastrophic forgetting during concept learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark datasets for fewshot classification tasks and achieve competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach performs well under challenging conditions such as varying number of samples per class, class imbalances, and noisy labels. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into designing models that leverage multiple types of memory mechanisms for effective learning and adaptation across different domains.",1
"While current benchmark reinforcement learning (RL) tasks have been useful to drive progress in the field, they are in many ways poor substitutes for learning with real-world data. By testing increasingly complex RL algorithms on low-complexity simulation environments, we often end up with brittle RL policies that generalize poorly beyond the very specific domain. To combat this, we propose three new families of benchmark RL domains that contain some of the complexity of the natural world, while still supporting fast and extensive data acquisition. The proposed domains also permit a characterization of generalization through fair train/test separation, and easy comparison and replication of results. Through this work, we challenge the RL research community to develop more robust algorithms that meet high standards of evaluation.",0
"Here is an example:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful approach to training agents that can interact with complex environments. However, evaluating RL algorithms remains challenging due to the difficulty of designing appropriate benchmark tasks. To address these issues, we introduce natural environment benchmarks (NEBs), which aim to provide realistic, open-ended settings that closely mirror human experience.  Our NEBs integrate multiple domains such as physics simulations, text generation, image recognition, and others. By encompassing diverse components within a single framework, our NEBs enable comprehensive evaluation of RL algorithms across multiple domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEBs through several experiments using representative RL methods like Soft Actor Critic, Proximal Policy Optimization, and SAC+Rainbow, among other modern RL models. Our results showcase improved performance on more difficult task distributions compared to existing benchmarks. In addition, by sharing code and data online, our study encourages reproducibility and comparison of future advances in RL research.  Our work represents an essential step towards developing better evaluation practices for RL research. More generally, our findings provide insights into how to build effective benchmarks in machine learning, particularly when faced with complex and varied problems involving multiple modalities.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been introduced to interactive recommender systems (IRS) because of its nature of learning from dynamic interactions and planning for long-run performance. As IRS is always with thousands of items to recommend (i.e., thousands of actions), most existing RL-based methods, however, fail to handle such a large discrete action space problem and thus become inefficient. The existing work that tries to deal with the large discrete action space problem by utilizing the deep deterministic policy gradient framework suffers from the inconsistency between the continuous action representation (the output of the actor network) and the real discrete action. To avoid such inconsistency and achieve high efficiency and recommendation effectiveness, in this paper, we propose a Tree-structured Policy Gradient Recommendation (TPGR) framework, where a balanced hierarchical clustering tree is built over the items and picking an item is formulated as seeking a path from the root to a certain leaf of the tree. Extensive experiments on carefully-designed environments based on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model provides superior recommendation performance and significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In this study we present our approach towards large-scale interactive recommendation using tree structured policy gradient (TSPG) learning. We demonstrate how TSPG can effectively learn user preferences across multiple domains and platforms, as well as the benefits of applying these learned preferences in real-world scenarios.

Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling technique that enables efficient computation at scale. Overall, our findings show significant improvements over traditional recommender systems and lay the foundation for future work on scalable interaction prediction models.

"This paper presents a novel approach to the technical analysis of wireheading in intelligent agents. Inspired by the natural analogues of wireheading and their prevalent manifestations, we propose the modeling of such phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents as psychological disorders. In a preliminary step towards evaluating this proposal, we study the feasibility and dynamics of emergent addictive policies in Q-learning agents in the tractable environment of the game of Snake. We consider a slightly modified settings for this game, in which the environment provides a ""drug"" seed alongside the original ""healthy"" seed for the consumption of the snake. We adopt and extend an RL-based model of natural addiction to Q-learning agents in this settings, and derive sufficient parametric conditions for the emergence of addictive behaviors in such agents. Furthermore, we evaluate our theoretical analysis with three sets of simulation-based experiments. The results demonstrate the feasibility of addictive wireheading in RL agents, and provide promising venues of further research on the psychopathological modeling of complex AI safety problems.",0
"While you may reference other research papers please keep it layman friendly. Also your references should reflect real world examples instead of scientific experiments. If no references have been found in the lay person community at large then simply use academic citation guidelines using research publications. You can assume that readers know basic concepts about reinforcement learning but need context into how these behaviors occur. Here is the first draft: When considering addiction as applied to humans, it becomes clear that there exist commonalities among human behavior which parallel those observed in artificial intelligence agents developed through reinforcement learning paradigms. In both cases, initial reward seeking actions gradually escalate towards compulsive and potentially destructive behaviors. Recent work has sought to study the emergent phenomenon within RL environments to better understand problematic agent behavior that could arise in future deployments of advanced machine intelligence systems. This paper seeks to investigate current attempts made by scholars to replicate addictive disorders found in humans with agents trained using modern deep neural network architectures capable of functioning across multiple discrete tasks. By comparing and contrasting different findings from published literature, this investigation establishes key insights on why certain types of reinforcement schedules tend to lead more frequently towards pathological behavior than others, as well as identifying potential pitfalls stemming from design choices during training regimens. Finally, we offer recommendations intended to mitigate development of harmful traits during interaction with deployed intelligent agents based on the discovered knowledge.

"Deep learning models are vulnerable to external attacks. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to generate adversarial examples for the pre-trained (target) models. We assume a semi black-box setting where the only access an adversary has to the target model is the class probabilities obtained for the input queries. We train a Deep Q Network (DQN) agent which, with experience, learns to attack only a small portion of image pixels to generate non-targeted adversarial images. Initially, an agent explores an environment by sequentially modifying random sets of image pixels and observes its effect on the class probabilities. At the end of an episode, it receives a positive (negative) reward if it succeeds (fails) to alter the label of the image. Experimental results with MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Imagenet datasets demonstrate that our RL framework is able to learn an effective attack policy.",0

"We present a novel algorithm to train a deep Q-learning agent using natural-gradient techniques. We compare the original deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to its natural-gradient counterpart, which we refer to as NGDQN, on a collection of classic control domains. Without employing target networks, NGDQN significantly outperforms DQN without target networks, and performs no worse than DQN with target networks, suggesting that NGDQN stabilizes training and can help reduce the need for additional hyperparameter tuning. We also find that NGDQN is less sensitive to hyperparameter optimization relative to DQN. Together these results suggest that natural-gradient techniques can improve value-function optimization in deep reinforcement learning.",0
"In recent years there has been growing interest in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a means by which machines can learn from interaction with their environment without explicit programming. One method that has gained significant popularity within this domain is deep Q-networks (DQN), an algorithm based on the deep neural network. This work contributes a new approach termed natural gradient DQN (NatGrad-DQN).  The standard DQN architecture has two parts: a convolutional neural network for sensory input processing, followed by a fully connected layer to estimate action values (i.e., expected future discounted reward starting from a given state–action pair). However, during training, we observed instability due to high variance updates generated by this linear approximation model, even though experience replay techniques have become commonplace to mitigate distribution shift issues. To address these stability problems, we introduce natural gradients into our architecture, which exploit the Fisher information matrix for more robust optimization. We find this simple modification dramatically improves the performance and robustness of our trained agents across benchmark control tasks, including continuous control and visually demanding Atari games.  We evaluate NatGrad-DQN against other methods using several metrics such as undiscounted return, success rate, number of steps, etc., demonstrating the improved stability resulting in superior agent performance under challenging task conditions. Moreover, as natural gradients lead to improved exploration, they enhance sample efficiency and thus reduce the amount of data required to achieve competitive results compared to SAC+FD and Rainbow. By stabilizing DQL algorithms via natural gradients, we show the potential to improve generalization and robustness beyond previous architectures and techniques.  Our findings contribute impo",1
"This paper tackles a new problem setting: reinforcement learning with pixel-wise rewards (pixelRL) for image processing. After the introduction of the deep Q-network, deep RL has been achieving great success. However, the applications of deep RL for image processing are still limited. Therefore, we extend deep RL to pixelRL for various image processing applications. In pixelRL, each pixel has an agent, and the agent changes the pixel value by taking an action. We also propose an effective learning method for pixelRL that significantly improves the performance by considering not only the future states of the own pixel but also those of the neighbor pixels. The proposed method can be applied to some image processing tasks that require pixel-wise manipulations, where deep RL has never been applied. We apply the proposed method to three image processing tasks: image denoising, image restoration, and local color enhancement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or better performance, compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on supervised learning.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized image processing tasks such as classification, segmentation and generation. In particular, fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets due to their ability to handle input images of arbitrary size. However, FCNs typically rely on a single end-to-end trainable network, which can lead to suboptimal results due to limitations in model capacity, training data or optimization techniques used during training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that combines multi-step reinforcement learning with a fully convolutional neural network for image processing. This approach allows us to learn multiple levels of representation from raw pixels all the way up to semantic concepts. Our framework uses a hierarchical policy decomposition, where each level learns a different aspect of image processing while interacting with lower levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.",1
"Modelling and exploiting teammates' policies in cooperative multi-agent systems have long been an interest and also a big challenge for the reinforcement learning (RL) community. The interest lies in the fact that if the agent knows the teammates' policies, it can adjust its own policy accordingly to arrive at proper cooperations; while the challenge is that the agents' policies are changing continuously due to they are learning concurrently, which imposes difficulty to model the dynamic policies of teammates accurately. In this paper, we present \emph{ATTention Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient} (ATT-MADDPG) to address this challenge. ATT-MADDPG extends DDPG, a single-agent actor-critic RL method, with two special designs. First, in order to model the teammates' policies, the agent should get access to the observations and actions of teammates. ATT-MADDPG adopts a centralized critic to collect such information. Second, to model the teammates' policies using the collected information in an effective way, ATT-MADDPG enhances the centralized critic with an attention mechanism. This attention mechanism introduces a special structure to explicitly model the dynamic joint policy of teammates, making sure that the collected information can be processed efficiently. We evaluate ATT-MADDPG on both benchmark tasks and the real-world packet routing tasks. Experimental results show that it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based methods and rule-based methods by a large margin, but also achieves better performance in terms of scalability and robustness.",0

"Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has recently shown promising advances on speeding up learning, improving the exploration, and discovering intertask transferable skills. Most recent works focus on HRL with two levels, i.e., a master policy manipulates subpolicies, which in turn manipulate primitive actions. However, HRL with multiple levels is usually needed in many real-world scenarios, whose ultimate goals are highly abstract, while their actions are very primitive. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a diversity-driven extensible HRL (DEHRL), where an extensible and scalable framework is built and learned levelwise to realize HRL with multiple levels. DEHRL follows a popular assumption: diverse subpolicies are useful, i.e., subpolicies are believed to be more useful if they are more diverse. However, existing implementations of this diversity assumption usually have their own drawbacks, which makes them inapplicable to HRL with multiple levels. Consequently, we further propose a novel diversity-driven solution to achieve this assumption in DEHRL. Experimental studies evaluate DEHRL with five baselines from four perspectives in two domains; the results show that DEHRL outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in all four aspects.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence.

"A crucial and time-sensitive task when any disaster occurs is to rescue victims and distribute resources to the right groups and locations. This task is challenging in populated urban areas, due to the huge burst of help requests generated in a very short period. To improve the efficiency of the emergency response in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, we propose a heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning scheduling algorithm, named as ResQ, which can effectively schedule the rapid deployment of volunteers to rescue victims in dynamic settings. The core concept is to quickly identify victims and volunteers from social network data and then schedule rescue parties with an adaptive learning algorithm. This framework performs two key functions: 1) identify trapped victims and rescue volunteers, and 2) optimize the volunteers' rescue strategy in a complex time-sensitive environment. The proposed ResQ algorithm can speed up the training processes through a heuristic function which reduces the state-action space by identifying the set of particular actions over others. Experimental results showed that the proposed heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning based scheduling outperforms several state-of-art methods, in terms of both reward rate and response times.",0

"The design of a reward function often poses a major practical challenge to real-world applications of reinforcement learning. Approaches such as inverse reinforcement learning attempt to overcome this challenge, but require expert demonstrations, which can be difficult or expensive to obtain in practice. We propose variational inverse control with events (VICE), which generalizes inverse reinforcement learning methods to cases where full demonstrations are not needed, such as when only samples of desired goal states are available. Our method is grounded in an alternative perspective on control and reinforcement learning, where an agent's goal is to maximize the probability that one or more events will happen at some point in the future, rather than maximizing cumulative rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on continuous control tasks, with a focus on high-dimensional observations like images where rewards are hard or even impossible to specify.",0
"This paper presents a novel framework called variational inverse control (VIC) with events, which provides a general approach for data-driven reward definition. VIC is based on the concept that if we can observe humans interacting with an environment, then we can learn their goals and objectives through inverse reinforcement learning. However, traditional IRL methods suffer from scalability issues due to the high computational cost involved in modeling continuous actions. To overcome these limitations, VIC uses predefined event markers to segment human interactions into meaningful subtasks. These markers serve as milestones to provide insights into how to effectively break down complex tasks into smaller units. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating remarkable improvements in several benchmark environments including discrete actions spaces.

"Data augmentation techniques such as cropping, rotating, flipping, scaling, color jittering, etc., are widely used for increasing the amount of training data available for deep learning models. However, choosing which techniques to apply on different datasets remains an open problem. In this work we propose a method that automatically learns augmentation policies for each dataset by conducting a search over a space of possible transformations at runtime. Our approach uses model predictions to guide the search process, selecting only those operations that most effectively improve performance. Experiments on image classification benchmarks show significant improvements compared to stateof-the-art hand-engineered rules and other automated methods. We further demonstrate that our learned policies can generalize across tasks and outperform competitive fine-tuned architectures. Overall, these results provide new insights into how augmentation policy search can be framed as a continuous optimization problem, highlighting the potential benefits of moving away from static augmentation rule sets towards more adaptive approaches that learn how to transform their inputs online. -----  This research presents a novel technique for automatically generating augmentation policies for use in deep learning models. While traditional approaches rely on fixed, predefined rules, the proposed method instead employs an augmented random search algorithm driven by model predictions. By focusing exclusively on operations that lead to improved accuracy, this system achieves remarkable gains over existing strategies. Evaluations conducted on standard image classification benchmarks indicate substantially better outcomes than both manual techniques and comparable automatic solutions. Furthermore, learned policies prove capable of transferring knowledge across related tasks and even surpass highly tuned neural networks.

"Evolution Strategies (ES) emerged as a scalable alternative to popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, providing an almost perfect speedup when distributed across hundreds of CPU cores thanks to a reduced communication overhead. Despite providing large improvements in wall-clock time, ES is data inefficient when compared to competing RL methods. One of the main causes of such inefficiency is the collection of large batches of experience, which are discarded after each policy update. In this work, we study how to perform more than one update per batch of experience by means of Importance Sampling while preserving the scalability of the original method. The proposed method, Importance Weighted Evolution Strategies (IW-ES), shows promising results and is a first step towards designing efficient ES algorithms.",0

By doing so, IWES adapts to changing environmental conditions and reduces search risk, which helps to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. In addition, the use of self-adapting step sizes allows for greater control over the exploration/exploitation tradeoff during the search process. Overall, IWES represents a promising development in the field of evolutionary computation, and has shown great potential for solving real-world optimization problems.",1

"We tackle the blackbox issue of deep neural networks in the settings of reinforcement learning (RL) where neural agents learn towards maximizing reward gains in an uncontrollable way. Such learning approach is risky when the interacting environment includes an expanse of state space because it is then almost impossible to foresee all unwanted outcomes and penalize them with negative rewards beforehand. Unlike reverse analysis of learned neural features from previous works, our proposed method \nj{tackles the blackbox issue by encouraging} an RL policy network to learn interpretable latent features through an implementation of a disentangled representation learning method. Toward this end, our method allows an RL agent to understand self-efficacy by distinguishing its influences from uncontrollable environmental factors, which closely resembles the way humans understand their scenes. Our experimental results show that the learned latent factors not only are interpretable, but also enable modeling the distribution of entire visited state space with a specific action condition. We have experimented that this characteristic of the proposed structure can lead to ex post facto governance for desired behaviors of RL agents.",0

"In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) based system to learn an effective policy for carpooling that maximizes transportation efficiency so that fewer cars are required to fulfill the given amount of trip demand. For this purpose, first, we develop a deep neural network model, called ST-NN (Spatio-Temporal Neural Network), to predict taxi trip time from the raw GPS trip data. Secondly, we develop a carpooling simulation environment for RL training, with the output of ST-NN and using the NYC taxi trip dataset. In order to maximize transportation efficiency and minimize traffic congestion, we choose the effective distance covered by the driver on a carpool trip as the reward. Therefore, the more effective distance a driver achieves over a trip (i.e. to satisfy more trip demand) the higher the efficiency and the less will be the traffic congestion. We compared the performance of RL learned policy to a fixed policy (which always accepts carpool) as a baseline and obtained promising results that are interpretable and demonstrate the advantage of our RL approach. We also compare the performance of ST-NN to that of state-of-the-art travel time estimation methods and observe that ST-NN significantly improves the prediction performance and is more robust to outliers.",0
"Abstract: With traffic congestion continuing to worsen globally, optimizing policies related to taxis has become crucial. This research uses reinforcement learning (RL) techniques along with spatio-temporal data mining to develop an adaptive carpool policy for taxis. By analyzing spatial patterns and temporal variations in demand and supply, we aim to identify optimal pickup locations that maximize ridership while minimizing travel distances for passengers. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing wait times, enhancing convenience, and promoting sustainability through ride-sharing. Our findings have implications for policymakers seeking solutions to transportation challenges. Overall, RL combined with data analysis provides valuable insights into designing efficient and equitable taxi services.",1
"Direct policy search is one of the most important algorithm of reinforcement learning. However, learning from scratch needs a large amount of experience data and can be easily prone to poor local optima. In addition to that, a partially trained policy tends to perform dangerous action to agent and environment. In order to overcome these challenges, this paper proposed a policy initialization algorithm called Policy Learning based on Completely Behavior Cloning (PLCBC). PLCBC first transforms the Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller into a piecewise affine (PWA) function using multi-parametric programming, and uses a neural network to express this function. By this way, PLCBC can completely clone the MPC controller without any performance loss, and is totally training-free. The experiments show that this initialization strategy can help agent learn at the high reward state region, and converge faster and better.",0
"In this study, we propose a sample-efficient approach to policy learning using completely behavior cloning (CBC). We explore how CBC can effectively learn policies even when faced with limited data availability, which is often a challenge in real-world applications. Our method combines offline simulation and online fine-tuning, enabling the agent to quickly adapt to new environments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. Additionally, we provide insights into why our method works so well by analyzing its training dynamics and the resulting agent behaviors. Overall, our results show great promise for applying CBC to difficult problems where data may be scarce.",1
"Correlation filter has been proven to be an effective tool for a number of approaches in visual tracking, particularly for seeking a good balance between tracking accuracy and speed. However, correlation filter based models are susceptible to wrong updates stemming from inaccurate tracking results. To date, little effort has been devoted towards handling the correlation filter update problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the correlation filter update problem. In our approach, we update and maintain multiple correlation filter models in parallel, and we use deep reinforcement learning for the selection of an optimal correlation filter model among them. To facilitate the decision process in an efficient manner, we propose a decision-net to deal target appearance modeling, which is trained through hundreds of challenging videos using proximal policy optimization and a lightweight learning network. An exhaustive evaluation of the proposed approach on the OTB100 and OTB2013 benchmarks show that the approach is effective enough to achieve the average success rate of 62.3% and the average precision score of 81.2%, both exceeding the performance of traditional correlation filter based trackers.",0
"Title: ""Correlation Filter Selection for Visual Tracking Using Deep Reinforcement Learning""  This work presents a novel approach to visual tracking using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a correlation filter selection method that leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture as both a tracker and a discriminator. By framing the track-by-detection task as a sequential decision process, we use reinforcement learning to optimize the feature representation learned by our CNN. Our approach learns to adaptively select filters based on the current state of the target object, enabling robustness against occlusions, deformations, and changes in appearance over time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while reducing computational complexity compared to previous approaches. This work represents a significant step forward towards real-time, high-performance visual tracking systems.",1
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents require the specification of a reward signal for learning behaviours. However, introduction of corrupt or stochastic rewards can yield high variance in learning. Such corruption may be a direct result of goal misspecification, randomness in the reward signal, or correlation of the reward with external factors that are not known to the agent. Corruption or stochasticity of the reward signal can be especially problematic in robotics, where goal specification can be particularly difficult for complex tasks. While many variance reduction techniques have been studied to improve the robustness of the RL process, handling such stochastic or corrupted reward structures remains difficult. As an alternative for handling this scenario in model-free RL methods, we suggest using an estimator for both rewards and value functions. We demonstrate that this improves performance under corrupted stochastic rewards in both the tabular and non-linear function approximation settings for a variety of noise types and environments. The use of reward estimation is a robust and easy-to-implement improvement for handling corrupted reward signals in model-free RL.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning has been successful in achieving high performance on many challenging problems. However, variance reduction techniques commonly used by deep neural networks have limited application in reinforcement learning algorithms due to their reliance on accurate estimates of cumulative rewards at multiple steps into the future. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that uses bootstrapping techniques from statistical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation to estimate variance under uncertainty. We demonstrate our method using empirical evaluations on benchmark problems where we show significant improvements over baseline methods. Our work provides new insights into how to reduce variance in deep reinforcement learning, opening up possibilities for even greater gains in performance in the field.",1
"In this paper, we propose the Quantile Option Architecture (QUOTA) for exploration based on recent advances in distributional reinforcement learning (RL). In QUOTA, decision making is based on quantiles of a value distribution, not only the mean. QUOTA provides a new dimension for exploration via making use of both optimism and pessimism of a value distribution. We demonstrate the performance advantage of QUOTA in both challenging video games and physical robot simulators.",0
"Title: The Quantile Option Architecture (QUOTA) for Improving Exploration Strategies in Reinforcement Learning  In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training artificial agents capable of solving complex tasks and learning from sparse rewards. However, a key challenge faced by reinforcement learning algorithms is the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This problem arises because to maximize the cumulative reward, an agent must explore new actions to discover better ones while exploiting known good options to accumulate reward. In practice, finding effective exploration strategies that balance these two objectives remains difficult.  The Quantile Option Architecture (QUOTA) represents a novel approach designed to address this issue by enabling more informed exploration decisions in reinforcement learning. Our method leverages quantiles, which represent non-parametric statistical summaries of data distributions, as a tool to identify meaningful regions in state space where an action may yield high returns. By incorporating quantiles into a model-free option architecture like Q-Learning, we can achieve improved exploration behavior without sacrificing overall performance on challenging benchmark domains.  We evaluate our approach using several well-known domains including SparseMountainCar, Acrobot, and LunarLander. Results show that QUOTA outperforms existing methods on many standard environments. Moreover, we provide ablation studies that demonstrate the importance of quantiles in guiding exploratory actions towards potentially profitable regions of state space.  Our work introduces a simple yet powerful mechanism for improving exploration efficiency in model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We believe that advances in exploration techniques, such as those proposed herein, have the potential to drive significant progress in fields ranging from robotics and computer graphics animation to autonomous systems engineering.",1
"In this paper, we propose an actor ensemble algorithm, named ACE, for continuous control with a deterministic policy in reinforcement learning. In ACE, we use actor ensemble (i.e., multiple actors) to search the global maxima of the critic. Besides the ensemble perspective, we also formulate ACE in the option framework by extending the option-critic architecture with deterministic intra-option policies, revealing a relationship between ensemble and options. Furthermore, we perform a look-ahead tree search with those actors and a learned value prediction model, resulting in a refined value estimation. We demonstrate a significant performance boost of ACE over DDPG and its variants in challenging physical robot simulators.",0
"This paper presents ACE (Actor Ensemble), a novel algorithm for continuous control using tree search methods. Inspired by recent advancements in actor-critic models for reinforcement learning, we propose training a set of deep neural network policies together as a ""ensemble"" that learns from both on-policy and off-policy data collected during interaction with the environment.  Our ensemble approach uses multiple actors instead of just one central actor, allowing each policy to specialize in different regions of state space and learn more efficiently. These individual policies interact competitively through shared replay buffers, encouraging diversity in their exploration strategies. We then use these diverse trained policies to guide our Monte Carlo Tree Search planner towards better and more informative simulations, further improving the quality of the final solution found by our method.  We evaluate ACE against several strong baseline algorithms in MuJoCo locomotion tasks, where agents must balance and move quickly in complex environments. Our results show that ACE significantly outperforms prior ensemble approaches, achieving new state-of-the-art performance across all tested domains, including difficult multi-task scenarios.  Through ablation studies, we analyze various components of ACE and demonstrate the benefits of our proposed design choices over simpler alternatives. Overall, our work provides a valuable contribution to the field of continuous control using deep neural networks, representing a significant step forward in enabling robust generalization to real world problems beyond current benchmarks.",1
"This work investigates continual learning of two segmentation tasks in brain MRI with neural networks. To explore in this context the capabilities of current methods for countering catastrophic forgetting of the first task when a new one is learned, we investigate elastic weight consolidation, a recently proposed method based on Fisher information, originally evaluated on reinforcement learning of Atari games. We use it to sequentially learn segmentation of normal brain structures and then segmentation of white matter lesions. Our findings show this recent method reduces catastrophic forgetting, while large room for improvement exists in these challenging settings for continual learning.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can effectively perform tasks such as image classification, segmentation, registration and other forms of processing in medical imaging. These models can achieve state of the art performance on various benchmark datasets; however they often have limited generalization abilities and lack the ability to adapt their knowledge continuously, which limits their effectiveness in real world clinical settings where new data constantly becomes available. To overcome these limitations we must develop methods to enable models to learn continually over time. This includes ensuring that the models are able to update their knowledge when presented with new training samples while minimizing forgetting previously learned concepts. Additionally, the models need to be efficient enough to ensure that updates occur quickly so that physicians have access to the latest advancements in diagnosis and treatment planning. The proposed approach incorporates online model selection techniques using uncertainty estimates obtained from Monte Carlo Dropout sampling during testing phase, so as to incrementally update previous predictions without requiring excessive computational resources. We demonstrate through experiments performed on large publicly available MRI brain scan databases how our method leads to improved accuracy across multiple metrics compared to static classifiers trained only once at initialization. Our results indicate that continual learning holds great promise for improving healthcare outcomes by enabling more accurate diagnoses through advanced AI technology.",1
"In a wide variety of applications, humans interact with a complex environment by means of asynchronous stochastic discrete events in continuous time. Can we design online interventions that will help humans achieve certain goals in such asynchronous setting? In this paper, we address the above problem from the perspective of deep reinforcement learning of marked temporal point processes, where both the actions taken by an agent and the feedback it receives from the environment are asynchronous stochastic discrete events characterized using marked temporal point processes. In doing so, we define the agent's policy using the intensity and mark distribution of the corresponding process and then derive a flexible policy gradient method, which embeds the agent's actions and the feedback it receives into real-valued vectors using deep recurrent neural networks. Our method does not make any assumptions on the functional form of the intensity and mark distribution of the feedback and it allows for arbitrarily complex reward functions. We apply our methodology to two different applications in personalized teaching and viral marketing and, using data gathered from Duolingo and Twitter, we show that it may be able to find interventions to help learners and marketers achieve their goals more effectively than alternatives.",0
"This is an abstract written by me to summarize the contents of the paper:  The paper proposes a novel application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to solve complex modeling tasks involving marked temporal point processes (MTPPs). MTPPs have been widely used in diverse applications ranging from sensor network data analysis to epidemiology and finance, where both event occurrences and associated mark data must be modeled simultaneously. Modeling such high-dimensional spatial-temporal stochastic process involves significant challenges due to the complexity of the problem structure, noise, limited number of observations, and the need for realism in capturing various spatio-temporal dependencies. The authors argue that traditional statistical methods may often fail under these conditions due to their limitations in coping with large amounts of nonlinearity and uncertainty inherent in many real-world phenomena. In contrast, RL has emerged as a promising tool for addressing these challenges due to its ability to learn optimal policies directly from raw sensory inputs without explicit models. However, until now, few studies have applied RL techniques specifically designed to model MTPPs. To fill this gap, the proposed method combines two complementary strengths of kernel density estimation (KDE)-based state representation with deep neural networks, allowing one to capture local patterns via KDE approximation and global relationships through expressive DNN functions. After introducing mathematical preliminaries on MTPP theory and essential ingredients required to set up deep RL problems, including appropriate state representations, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), our main contributions include several innovations in solving MTUPS problems using deep RL methods. Firstly, we present theoretical justifications why nai",1
"Temporal difference learning (TD) is a simple iterative algorithm used to estimate the value function corresponding to a given policy in a Markov decision process. Although TD is one of the most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis has proved challenging and few guarantees on its statistical efficiency are available. In this work, we provide a simple and explicit finite time analysis of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation. Except for a few key insights, our analysis mirrors standard techniques for analyzing stochastic gradient descent algorithms, and therefore inherits the simplicity and elegance of that literature. Final sections of the paper show how all of our main results extend to the study of TD learning with eligibility traces, known as TD($\lambda$), and to Q-learning applied in high-dimensional optimal stopping problems.",0
"In this paper, we present a finite time analysis of temporal difference learning (TDL) with linear function approximation. TDL is a widely used model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that relies on bootstrapping to estimate value functions and optimize policy updates. However, existing analyses of TDL often assume infinite time horizons and convergence rates can vary significantly depending on problem characteristics and hyperparameters chosen. To address these limitations, we analyze the performance of TD(λ) under reasonable assumptions on problem classes, providing bounds on both the estimation error and policy evaluation error as a function of time steps taken by the agent. Our results demonstrate how different approximations impact the rate of convergence, and provide insights into which settings lead to faster adaptation and better overall performance. By accounting for the effects of approximate representations and limited computation resources, our work contributes new understanding towards more effective use of RL algorithms in practice.",1
"With the growing prevalence of smart grid technology, short-term load forecasting (STLF) becomes particularly important in power system operations. There is a large collection of methods developed for STLF, but selecting a suitable method under varying conditions is still challenging. This paper develops a novel reinforcement learning based dynamic model selection (DMS) method for STLF. A forecasting model pool is first built, including ten state-of-the-art machine learning based forecasting models. Then a Q-learning agent learns the optimal policy of selecting the best forecasting model for the next time step, based on the model performance. The optimal DMS policy is applied to select the best model at each time step with a moving window. Numerical simulations on two-year load and weather data show that the Q-learning algorithm converges fast, resulting in effective and efficient DMS. The developed STLF model with Q-learning based DMS improves the forecasting accuracy by approximately 50%, compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning based STLF models.",0
"Here is an abstract that could be used for a paper on reinforcement learning dynamic model selection for short-term load forecasting:  Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a crucial role in power system operations.

RLDMS uses real-time data from sensors such as electricity meters, weather stations, and temperature gauges combined with machine learning models. Our proposed method employs deep neural networks and genetic algorithms integrated into Q-learning agents trained through self-play. We test our technique using historical datasets from power systems and compare our results against existing methods, demonstrating improved accuracy. By dynamically selecting relevant features at each time step, RLDMS provides more precise STLF predictions compared to static feature sets or single models. With its ability to adaptively learn, select models, and improve performance, RLDMS offers significant advantages for power grid operation management.

"Recently Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has aroused great interest in both academia and industry, however it remains challenging because of its huge and non-continuous search space. Instead of applying evolutionary algorithm or reinforcement learning as previous works, this paper proposes a Direct Sparse Optimization NAS (DSO-NAS) method. In DSO-NAS, we provide a novel model pruning view to NAS problem. In specific, we start from a completely connected block, and then introduce scaling factors to scale the information flow between operations. Next, we impose sparse regularizations to prune useless connections in the architecture. Lastly, we derive an efficient and theoretically sound optimization method to solve it. Our method enjoys both advantages of differentiability and efficiency, therefore can be directly applied to large datasets like ImageNet.

"In order to build artificial intelligence applications, we need models that can solve complex problems while being efficient enough to run on current hardware. Model architecture search can improve both performance and efficiency by automating the process of designing custom neural networks. Current approaches require large computational resources, time, and may generate multiple architectures before finding one that works well. This work proposes a new method called ""You Only Search Once"" (YOSO) which directly optimizes sparse connections using gradient descent without generating several candidates. By only searching once, YOSO saves computation cost and eliminates late-training collapse issues caused by warm restarts during model generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate YOSO achieves better tradeoffs among accuracy, latency, FLOPs, and parameters compared to random search, evolutionary algorithm NAS, weight-sharing DARTS variants, GDAS, and SNAS under limited computational budgets. As a result, our approach enables flexible automation of real-world systems.",1
"Sparse reward problems are one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning. Goal-directed tasks are one such sparse reward problems where a reward signal is received only when the goal is reached. One promising way to train an agent to perform goal-directed tasks is to use Hindsight Learning approaches. In these approaches, even when an agent fails to reach the desired goal, the agent learns to reach the goal it achieved instead. Doing this over multiple trajectories while generalizing the policy learned from the achieved goals, the agent learns a goal conditioned policy to reach any goal. One such approach is Hindsight Experience replay which uses an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn a goal conditioned policy. In this approach, a replay of the past transitions happens in a uniformly random fashion. Another approach is to use a Hindsight version of the policy gradients to directly learn a policy. In this work, we discuss different ways to replay past transitions to improve learning in hindsight experience replay focusing on prioritized variants in particular. Also, we implement the Hindsight Policy gradient methods to robotic tasks.",0

We propose a new algorithm called probabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling (PETS) that combines uncertainty-aware deep network dynamics models with sampling-based uncertainty propagation. Our comparison to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free deep RL algorithms shows that our approach matches the asymptotic performance of model-free algorithms on several challenging benchmark tasks, while requiring significantly fewer samples (e.g., 8 and 125 times fewer samples than Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization respectively on the half-cheetah task).",0
"This work presents a novel approach for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that enables agents to learn complex tasks in just a handful of trials.

We demonstrate our approach across diverse environments, including continuous control problems such as acrobot and mountain car, as well as discrete action spaces like Cartpole and Gridworld. In all cases, we show that our agent learns faster and achieves higher final performance compared to several strong DRL baselines with similar computational budgets. Our findings suggest that combining deep neural networks with efficient exploration strategies can enable agents to quickly adapt to new tasks and make effective decisions under uncertainty.",1
"Dantzig Selector (DS) is widely used in compressed sensing and sparse learning for feature selection and sparse signal recovery. Since the DS formulation is essentially a linear programming optimization, many existing linear programming solvers can be simply applied for scaling up. The DS formulation can be explained as a basis pursuit denoising problem, wherein the data matrix (or measurement matrix) is employed as the denoising matrix to eliminate the observation noise. However, we notice that the data matrix may not be the optimal denoising matrix, as shown by a simple counter-example. This motivates us to pursue a better denoising matrix for defining a general DS formulation. We first define the optimal denoising matrix through a minimax optimization, which turns out to be an NPhard problem. To make the problem computationally tractable, we propose a novel algorithm, termed as Optimal Denoising Dantzig Selector (ODDS), to approximately estimate the optimal denoising matrix. Empirical experiments validate the proposed method. Finally, a novel sparse reinforcement learning algorithm is formulated by extending the proposed ODDS algorithm to temporal difference learning, and empirical experimental results demonstrate to outperform the conventional vanilla DS-TD algorithm.",0
"In recent years, the problem of high-dimensional statistical inference has become increasingly important due to the explosive growth in data volume and variety.

This approach combines the advantages of model selection consistency and sparse estimation while maintaining computational efficiency. We then apply our proposed methodology to reinforcement learning problems, where the goal is to optimize sequential decision making under uncertainty. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks on several classic control tasks, including LQR and DDPG, providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in complex real-world applications.

"The problem-solving in automated theorem proving (ATP) can be interpreted as a search problem where the prover constructs a proof tree step by step. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for proof search in intuitionistic propositional logic.

We, however, overcame this issue by applying a novel data augmentation procedure at each iteration of the reinforcement learning. We also improve the efficiency of the algorithm by representing the syntactic structure of formulas by a novel compact graph representation. Using the large volume of augmented data, we train highly accurate graph neural networks that approximate the value function for the set of the syntactic structures of formulas. Our method is also cost-efficient in terms of computational time. We will show that our prover outperforms Coq's $\texttt{tauto}$ tactic, a prover based on human-engineered heuristics.

"Deep generative models have been successfully used to learn representations for high-dimensional discrete spaces by representing discrete objects as sequences and employing powerful sequence-based deep models. Unfortunately, these sequence-based models often produce invalid sequences: sequences which do not represent any underlying discrete structure; invalid sequences hinder the utility of such models. As a step towards solving this problem, we propose to learn a deep recurrent validator model, which can estimate whether a partial sequence can function as the beginning of a full, valid sequence. This validator provides insight as to how individual sequence elements influence the validity of the overall sequence, and can be used to constrain sequence based models to generate valid sequences -- and thus faithfully model discrete objects. Our approach is inspired by reinforcement learning, where an oracle which can evaluate validity of complete sequences provides a sparse reward signal. We demonstrate its effectiveness as a generative model of Python 3 source code for mathematical expressions, and in improving the ability of a variational autoencoder trained on SMILES strings to decode valid molecular structures.",0

"Title: Solving Multi-Step Markov Decision Problems Using Linear Function Approximation and Gradient Descent  Multi-step model-based reinforcement learning (RL) refers to algorithms that make use of a learned model of the environment dynamics, rather than relying solely on samples collected through interaction with the environment. In this work, we propose a simple algorithm for solving multi-step RL problems using linear function approximation and gradient descent, which outperforms existing methods in terms of both sample efficiency and solution quality.  The proposed method involves first learning a compact representation of the environment transition probabilities using principal component analysis (PCA). This allows us to represent the full transition matrix using only a few basis functions, resulting in substantial computational savings over alternatives such as value iteration. We then solve the Markov decision problem by optimizing a linear objective function defined directly over the action sequence space. By leveraging gradient descent updates based on offline policy evaluation, our approach avoids some of the computational issues associated with other model-based approaches while still offering substantial advantages over model-free techniques.  We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks from the literature, including the classic mountain car task and three variants of a continuous control particle world simulation. Our results show consistent improvements over existing model-based and model-free baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in solving complex multi-step RL problems.

"Policy optimization is an effective reinforcement learning approach to solve continuous control tasks. Recent achievements have shown that alternating online and offline optimization is a successful choice for efficient trajectory reuse. However, deciding when to stop optimizing and collect new trajectories is non-trivial, as it requires to account for the variance of the objective function estimate. In this paper, we propose a novel, model-free, policy search algorithm, POIS, applicable in both action-based and parameter-based settings. We first derive a high-confidence bound for importance sampling estimation; then we define a surrogate objective function, which is optimized offline whenever a new batch of trajectories is collected. Finally, the algorithm is tested on a selection of continuous control tasks, with both linear and deep policies, and compared with state-of-the-art policy optimization methods.",0
"Abstract: Many machine learning models can benefit from efficient optimization techniques that improve the quality of their solutions. In particular, many modern models use large neural networks which often suffer from slow convergence due to vanishing gradients during backpropagation. Gradient based methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can take many epochs to converge on high-quality solutions due to these issues. However, by using randomized sampling techniques like minibatching and importance sampling, we can reduce the variance of our gradients and speed up training time while still converging on accurate solutions. This paper presents a method for optimizing policy updates within reinforcement learning agents through the application of importance sampling. Our experiments show significant improvements over traditional methods across multiple environments with varying complexity. These results demonstrate that incorporating variance reduction techniques into reinforcement learning algorithms leads to more efficient training and better overall performance.",1
"Recently, with convolutional neural networks gaining significant achievements in many challenging machine learning fields, hand-crafted neural networks no longer satisfy our requirements as designing a network will cost a lot, and automatically generating architectures has attracted increasingly more attention and focus. Some research on auto-generated networks has achieved promising results. However, they mainly aim at picking a series of single layers such as convolution or pooling layers one by one. There are many elegant and creative designs in the carefully hand-crafted neural networks, such as Inception-block in GoogLeNet, residual block in residual network and dense block in dense convolutional network.

By training a population of neural networks incrementally on different batches of data and selecting the most successful ones, we can achieve better performance than random search methods that rely solely on trial and error. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets across different tasks such as image classification and sequence prediction. Additionally, we show that the learned models have comparable computational requirements compared to those found by other methods, making them suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios. Overall, our work highlights the potential of reinforcement learning for automating the design process of deep neural networks.",1
"This work provides a thorough study on how reward scaling can affect performance of deep reinforcement learning agents. In particular, we would like to answer the question that how does reward scaling affect non-saturating ReLU networks in RL? This question matters because ReLU is one of the most effective activation functions for deep learning models. We also propose an Adaptive Network Scaling framework to find a suitable scale of the rewards during learning for better performance. We conducted empirical studies to justify the solution.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in recent years due to advancements in deep reinforcement learning models that allow agents to make decisions based on environmental feedback. However, these models can often become unstable during training due to their reliance on highly nonlinear function approximators such as rectified linear units (ReLU). In this work, we propose Adaptive Network Scaling (ANS), a novel regularization technique that stabilizes ReLU-based models by dynamically adjusting the network capacity according to the magnitude of the input data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across several challenging continuous control tasks and show that ANS consistently improves both stability and performance compared to traditional approaches like weight decay and Dropout. Our results highlight the importance of adaptively controlling model complexity in deep RL settings and provide new insights into how we can better design more robust neural networks for real-world applications.",1
"Attention modules connecting encoder and decoders have been widely applied in the field of object recognition, image captioning, visual question answering and neural machine translation, and significantly improves the performance. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up gated hierarchical attention (GHA) mechanism for image captioning. Our proposed model employs a CNN as the decoder which is able to learn different concepts at different layers, and apparently, different concepts correspond to different areas of an image. Therefore, we develop the GHA in which low-level concepts are merged into high-level concepts and simultaneously low-level attended features pass to the top to make predictions. Our GHA significantly improves the performance of the model that only applies one level attention, for example, the CIDEr score increases from 0.923 to 0.999, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art models that employ attributes boosting and reinforcement learning (RL). We also conduct extensive experiments to analyze the CNN decoder and our proposed GHA, and we find that deeper decoders cannot obtain better performance, and when the convolutional decoder becomes deeper the model is likely to collapse during training.",0
"Our research proposes a novel approach to image caption generation using gated hierarchical attention networks (GHANs). Inspired by recent advancements in neural machine translation (NMT), we introduce GHANs as an alternative to traditional encoder-decoder models that suffer from difficulties in capturing multi-step dependencies.  Our model consists of two key components: a feature extraction layer followed by multiple layers of our proposed GHAN architecture. In each GHAN layer, we utilize self-attention mechanisms at both the token level and the sentence level, which helps guide the model towards important visual regions and informative sentence structures. We then apply dynamic gates to control the flow of information across different levels, enabling selective focus on relevant contextual information. This allows us to effectively generate semantically meaningful and coherent captions while alleviating issues related to sequential decoding.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art image captioning approaches. On standard benchmark datasets such as MSCOCO and Flickr30K, our model achieves significant improvements in automatic evaluation metrics like BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, as well as human evaluations measuring relevance, content quality, and diversity. Overall, these findings suggest that GHANs provide a powerful new tool for the challenging task of generating natural language descriptions of images.",1
"We introduce an exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning methods that is easy to implement and adds minimal overhead to the computation performed. The bonus is the error of a neural network predicting features of the observations given by a fixed randomly initialized neural network. We also introduce a method to flexibly combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. We find that the random network distillation (RND) bonus combined with this increased flexibility enables significant progress on several hard exploration Atari games. In particular we establish state of the art performance on Montezuma's Revenge, a game famously difficult for deep reinforcement learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves better than average human performance on this game without using demonstrations or having access to the underlying state of the game, and occasionally completes the first level.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in developing methods that can efficiently explore high dimensional spaces such as the space of deep neural networks. Traditional random search approaches sample small perturbations randomly from predefined hyperparameter spaces. More recently, there have been efforts to use reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithms like evolution strategies (ES), policy gradients (PG), and Q-learning to speed up exploration in these hyperparamater spaces. These RL-based algorithms leverage gradient information provided by automatic differentiation tools to make informed decisions about which directions to take along each step of the optimization process. However, RL algorithms require careful tuning of several parameters such as discount factors and entropy regularization terms, and they often suffer from slow convergence due to the nonconvexity of the problem landscape. To address some of these challenges we propose a new method called ""Random Network Distillation"" (RND). RND combines the benefits of both random sampling and distillation-based techniques while overcoming many of their limitations. Our approach samples small perturbations randomly from a set of pretrained models, applies them sequentially, and trains the resulting perturbed network using knowledge distillation techniques. We show experimentally that our method outperforms traditional random search baselines on benchmark datasets across multiple tasks such as image classification, language modeling, and machine translation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the manuscript.",1
"This paper investigates the vision-based autonomous driving with deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Different from the end-to-end learning method, our method breaks the vision-based lateral control system down into a perception module and a control module. The perception module which is based on a multi-task learning neural network first takes a driver-view image as its input and predicts the track features. The control module which is based on reinforcement learning then makes a control decision based on these features. In order to improve the data efficiency, we propose visual TORCS (VTORCS), a deep reinforcement learning environment which is based on the open racing car simulator (TORCS). By means of the provided functions, one can train an agent with the input of an image or various physical sensor measurement, or evaluate the perception algorithm on this simulator. The trained reinforcement learning controller outperforms the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller and model predictive control (MPC) controller on different tracks. The experiments demonstrate that the perception module shows promising performance and the controller is capable of controlling the vehicle drive well along the track center with visual input.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress in developing autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads without human intervention. One key challenge facing these systems is how to control lateral movement (steering) in real-time, given uncertain environment conditions such as road surface changes or sudden obstacles in the vehicle's path. This study presents a new approach to controlling lateral movement using reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques. We developed a novel model that learns from experience, improving over time through trial and error until it can effectively handle unknown scenarios while maintaining safety. Our results show that our system outperforms traditional rule-based approaches under various environmental conditions by accurately predicting driving lanes and making adjustments accordingly. Overall, we believe this research represents a promising step towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

"Generalization has been one of the major challenges for learning dynamics models in model-based reinforcement learning. However, previous work on action-conditioned dynamics prediction focuses on learning the pixel-level motion and thus does not generalize well to novel environments with different object layouts. In this paper, we present a novel object-oriented framework, called object-oriented dynamics predictor (OODP), which decomposes the environment into objects and predicts the dynamics of objects conditioned on both actions and object-to-object relations. It is an end-to-end neural network and can be trained in an unsupervised manner. To enable the generalization ability of dynamics learning, we design a novel CNN-based relation mechanism that is class-specific (rather than object-specific) and exploits the locality principle. Empirical results show that OODP significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of generalization over novel environments with various object layouts. OODP is able to learn from very few environments and accurately predict dynamics in a large number of unseen environments. In addition, OODP learns semantically and visually interpretable dynamics models.",0
"""Object-oriented programming is widely used in software development because of its advantages over procedural programming methods. However, traditional object-oriented programming requires extensive knowledge of the class hierarchy and inheritance relationships at design time, which can lead to maintenance issues and make code modification difficult. To overcome these limitations, we have developed an Object-Oriented Dynamics Predictor (OOPD) that uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict how objects interact dynamically in an application at runtime. Our OOPD system provides a flexible and efficient approach for understanding object behavior without relying on predefined rules. In addition, our model achieves high accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.""",1
"Multi-objective optimizations are frequently encountered in engineering practices. The solution techniques and parametric selections however are usually problem-specific. In this study we formulate a reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic scheme, and propose four low-level heuristics which can work coherently with the single point search algorithm MOSA/R (Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on Re-seed) towards multi-objective optimization problems of general applications. Making use of the domination amount, crowding distance and hypervolume calculations, the proposed hyper-heuristic scheme can meet various optimization requirements adaptively and autonomously. The approach developed not only exhibits improved and more robust performance compared to AMOSA, NSGA-II and MOEA/D when applied to benchmark test cases, but also shows promising results when applied to a generic structural fault identification problem. The outcome of this research can be extended to a variety of design and manufacturing optimization applications.",0

Overall, I believe that this is a valuable contribution to the literature on computer science and artificial intelligence, as it represents an advance over existing methods and has significant potential applications in industry and other areas. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in these topics.",1
"Collecting training data from the physical world is usually time-consuming and even dangerous for fragile robots, and thus, recent advances in robot learning advocate the use of simulators as the training platform. Unfortunately, the reality gap between synthetic and real visual data prohibits direct migration of the models trained in virtual worlds to the real world. This paper proposes a modular architecture for tackling the virtual-to-real problem. The proposed architecture separates the learning model into a perception module and a control policy module, and uses semantic image segmentation as the meta representation for relating these two modules. The perception module translates the perceived RGB image to semantic image segmentation. The control policy module is implemented as a deep reinforcement learning agent, which performs actions based on the translated image segmentation. Our architecture is evaluated in an obstacle avoidance task and a target following task. Experimental results show that our architecture significantly outperforms all of the baseline methods in both virtual and real environments, and demonstrates a faster learning curve than them. We also present a detailed analysis for a variety of variant configurations, and validate the transferability of our modular architecture.",0

We demonstrate state of the art results across multiple benchmark datasets including Cityscapes, Pascal VOC2012, and COCO Stuff.",1
"Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is regarded as an effective and efficient technology to share radio spectrum among different networks. As a secondary user (SU), a DSA device will face two critical problems: avoiding causing harmful interference to primary users (PUs), and conducting effective interference coordination with other secondary users. These two problems become even more challenging for a distributed DSA network where there is no centralized controllers for SUs. In this paper, we investigate communication strategies of a distributive DSA network under the presence of spectrum sensing errors. To be specific, we apply the powerful machine learning tool, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for SUs to learn ""appropriate"" spectrum access strategies in a distributed fashion assuming NO knowledge of the underlying system statistics. Furthermore, a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called the reservoir computing (RC), is utilized to realize DRL by taking advantage of the underlying temporal correlation of the DSA network. Using the introduced machine learning-based strategy, SUs could make spectrum access decisions distributedly relying only on their own current and past spectrum sensing outcomes. Through extensive experiments, our results suggest that the RC-based spectrum access strategy can help the SU to significantly reduce the chances of collision with PUs and other SUs. We also show that our scheme outperforms the myopic method which assumes the knowledge of system statistics, and converges faster than the Q-learning method when the number of channels is large.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to distributive dynamic spectrum access using deep reinforcement learning and reservoir computing. With growing demand for wireless communication services, there is a need for efficient utilization of available radio frequency (RF) resources.

The proposed method addresses these issues by introducing decentralized decision making based on reinforcement learning techniques.  Reservoir computing is used as the foundation for building a neural network capable of handling complex nonlinear interactions among different RF channels. The authors present a detailed analysis of how their proposed algorithm achieves effective resource allocation, balancing channel loading, and maintaining fairness across users. The performance evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches in terms of spectral efficiency, packet delivery ratio, and user satisfaction. The findings highlight the potential benefits of applying deep learning techniques to distributed RF management problems.

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from three core difficulties: temporal credit assignment with sparse rewards, lack of effective exploration, and brittle convergence properties that are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters. Collectively, these challenges severely limit the applicability of these approaches to real-world problems. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), a class of black box optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution, are well suited to address each of these three challenges. However, EAs typically suffer from high sample complexity and struggle to solve problems that require optimization of a large number of parameters. In this paper, we introduce Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a hybrid algorithm that leverages the population of an EA to provide diversified data to train an RL agent, and reinserts the RL agent into the EA population periodically to inject gradient information into the EA. ERL inherits EA's ability of temporal credit assignment with a fitness metric, effective exploration with a diverse set of policies, and stability of a population-based approach and complements it with off-policy DRL's ability to leverage gradients for higher sample efficiency and faster learning. Experiments in a range of challenging continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that ERL significantly outperforms prior DRL and EA methods.",0
"In recent years, policy gradient methods have gained popularity as efficient and effective techniques for solving reinforcement learning problems. However, these approaches can suffer from high variance due to their reliance on stochastic gradients that can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we propose evolution guided policy gradient (EGPG), which incorporates principles of natural selection into the optimization process. Our approach uses a set of candidate policies generated by mutation and selection operators inspired by genetic algorithms. By iteratively applying these operations over multiple generations, our method effectively reduces variance and produces more robust solutions than standard policy gradient techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on benchmark domains such as Gridworld, Mountaincar, and LunarLander. Our results show that EGPG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art policy gradient methods across all tasks considered. Overall, our work advances the field of RL by introducing novel biologically inspired principles that enhance policy search efficiency and stability.",1
"We present a reinforcement learning approach for detecting objects within an image. Our approach performs a step-wise deformation of a bounding box with the goal of tightly framing the object. It uses a hierarchical tree-like representation of predefined region candidates, which the agent can zoom in on. This reduces the number of region candidates that must be evaluated so that the agent can afford to compute new feature maps before each step to enhance detection quality. We compare an approach that is based purely on zoom actions with one that is extended by a second refinement stage to fine-tune the bounding box after each zoom step. We also improve the fitting ability by allowing for different aspect ratios of the bounding box. Finally, we propose different reward functions to lead to a better guidance of the agent while following its search trajectories. Experiments indicate that each of these extensions leads to more correct detections. The best performing approach comprises a zoom stage and a refinement stage, uses aspect-ratio modifying actions and is trained using a combination of three different reward metrics.",0

"We study the problem of multiset prediction. The goal of multiset prediction is to train a predictor that maps an input to a multiset consisting of multiple items. Unlike existing problems in supervised learning, such as classification, ranking and sequence generation, there is no known order among items in a target multiset, and each item in the multiset may appear more than once, making this problem extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiset loss function by viewing this problem from the perspective of sequential decision making. The proposed multiset loss function is empirically evaluated on two families of datasets, one synthetic and the other real, with varying levels of difficulty, against various baseline loss functions including reinforcement learning, sequence, and aggregated distribution matching loss functions. The experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed loss function over the others.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing machine learning models that can make predictions on multisets. These types of data sets often contain duplicate or missing elements, making traditional approaches to prediction less effective. As such, researchers have begun exploring alternative loss functions that can better handle these complexities.  This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing loss functions used for predicting on multisets. We begin by discussing some common pitfalls associated with using standard loss functions and how they fail to capture important properties of these unique data sets. Next, we provide a detailed analysis of several popular loss functions, highlighting their strengths and limitations for different use cases.  Our review reveals that no single loss function outperforms all others across all scenarios. However, certain losses demonstrate superior performance under specific conditions. For example, the Jaccard distance may be preferable when considering binary data, while the Spearman footrule is well suited for numerical values. Ultimately, the choice of loss function depends heavily on the context and problem at hand.  Overall, our work provides valuable insights into which loss functions are most appropriate for certain types of multiset data and underscores the importance of careful consideration during model selection. With further developments in this area, we hope to see more accurate predictions being made from these intricate datasets.",1
"Variable speed limits (VSL) control is a flexible way to improve traffic condition,increase safety and reduce emission. There is an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning technique for VSL control and recent studies have shown promising results. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to develope autonomous control agents for problems that were previously intractable. In this paper, we propose a more effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model for differential variable speed limits (DVSL) control, in which the dynamic and different speed limits among lanes can be imposed. The proposed DRL models use a novel actor-critic architecture which can learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continues action space. Different reward signals, e.g. total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency braking, and vehicular emission are used to train the DVSL controller, and comparison between these reward signals are conducted.

"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms that estimate state and state-action value functions have been shown to be effective in a variety of challenging domains, including learning control strategies from raw image pixels. However, algorithms that estimate state and state-action value functions typically assume a fully observed state and must compensate for partial observations by using finite length observation histories or recurrent networks. In this work, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on counterfactual regret minimization that iteratively updates an approximation to an advantage-like function and is robust to partially observed state. We demonstrate that this new algorithm can substantially outperform strong baseline methods on several partially observed reinforcement learning tasks: learning first-person 3D navigation in Doom and Minecraft, and acting in the presence of partially observed objects in Doom and Pong.",0
"Title: Regret minimization for partially observable deep reinforcement learning Abstract This paper presents an algorithmic framework for regret minimization in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) based on deep neural networks.

"This paper presents a new meta-modeling framework to employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate mechanical constitutive models for interfaces. The constitutive models are conceptualized as information flow in directed graphs. The process of writing constitutive models are simplified as a sequence of forming graph edges with the goal of maximizing the model score (a function of accuracy, robustness and forward prediction quality). Thus meta-modeling can be formulated as a Markov decision process with well-defined states, actions, rules, objective functions, and rewards. By using neural networks to estimate policies and state values, the computer agent is able to efficiently self-improve the constitutive model it generated through self-playing, in the same way AlphaGo Zero (the algorithm that outplayed the world champion in the game of Go)improves its gameplay. Our numerical examples show that this automated meta-modeling framework not only produces models which outperform existing cohesive models on benchmark traction-separation data but is also capable of detecting hidden mechanisms among micro-structural features and incorporating them in constitutive models to improve the forward prediction accuracy, which are difficult tasks to do manually.",0
"Traction-separation law models describe the frictional forces acting on the interface between two solids by using constitutive relationships that depend on both sliding velocity (kinematic parameter) and normal stress difference across the interface (thermodynamic state variable). These macroscale parameters can then be used as inputs into simulations to study phenomena such as vehicle motion and instability, soil excavation, wear processes, and friction experiments under varying environments. However, current formulations still lack adequate accuracy or require simplifying assumptions due to limited data available and difficulty in experimentation and computation. Therefore, developing efficient numerical methods such as reinforcement learning could allow us to derive accurate and theoretically consistent models from available datasets to predict reliable predictions under realistic conditions in these application areas. This work addresses this issue by proposing the use of meta-modeling games which rely on deep reinforcement learning algorithms that enable quick exploration of large search spaces to uncover novel and physically meaningful solutions that are simultaneously thermodynamically and mechanistically sound, as well as mathematically tractable. To accomplish this goal, we designed a simulation environment where agents interact based on certain rules governing their behavior in terms of objective functions, decision policies, and reward feedbacks. During training episodes, agents gradually adapt their control strategies through trial-and-error interactions with other agents to optimize their performance measures against desired criteria specified by human judges in specific applications.

"Deep reinforcement learning achieves superhuman performance in a range of video game environments, but requires that a designer manually specify a reward function. It is often easier to provide demonstrations of a target behavior than to design a reward function describing that behavior. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms can infer a reward from demonstrations in low-dimensional continuous control environments, but there has been little work on applying IRL to high-dimensional video games. In our CNN-AIRL baseline, we modify the state-of-the-art adversarial IRL (AIRL) algorithm to use CNNs for the generator and discriminator. To stabilize training, we normalize the reward and increase the size of the discriminator training dataset. We additionally learn a low-dimensional state representation using a novel autoencoder architecture tuned for video game environments. This embedding is used as input to the reward network, improving the sample efficiency of expert demonstrations.

Our method leverages trajectory data from expert players, which we then fit using maximum entropy methods to approximate their policy distribution. We validate our framework on two challenging RTS games, StarCraft II and Age of Empires II, by evaluating the accuracy of inferred rewards against gold standards generated by domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate the potential application of inverse reinforcement learning techniques in improving artificial intelligence agents' performance through evaluation of the learned reward functions on agent policies obtained via reinforcement learning.

"Here's your requested abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to solve many complex problems in robotics, computer games, economics, and other fields. However, most RL algorithms suffer from instability issues that make them difficult to use in practice. In particular, policy gradient methods often require careful tuning of hyperparameters to converge reliably.

"We consider model-free reinforcement learning for infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a continuous state space and unknown transition kernel, when only a single sample path under an arbitrary policy of the system is available. We consider the Nearest Neighbor Q-Learning (NNQL) algorithm to learn the optimal Q function using nearest neighbor regression method. As the main contribution, we provide tight finite sample analysis of the convergence rate. In particular, for MDPs with a $d$-dimensional state space and the discounted factor $\gamma \in (0,1)$, given an arbitrary sample path with ""covering time"" $ L $, we establish that the algorithm is guaranteed to output an $\varepsilon$-accurate estimate of the optimal Q-function using $\tilde{O}\big(L/(\varepsilon^3(1-\gamma)^7)\big)$ samples. For instance, for a well-behaved MDP, the covering time of the sample path under the purely random policy scales as $ \tilde{O}\big(1/\varepsilon^d\big),$ so the sample complexity scales as $\tilde{O}\big(1/\varepsilon^{d+3}\big).$ Indeed, we establish a lower bound that argues that the dependence of $ \tilde{\Omega}\big(1/\varepsilon^{d+2}\big)$ is necessary.",0

"We propose a practical non-episodic PSRL algorithm that unlike recent state-of-the-art PSRL algorithms uses a deterministic, model-independent episode switching schedule. Our algorithm termed deterministic schedule PSRL (DS-PSRL) is efficient in terms of time, sample, and space complexity. We prove a Bayesian regret bound under mild assumptions. Our result is more generally applicable to multiple parameters and continuous state action problems. We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art PSRL algorithms on standard discrete and continuous problems from the literature. Finally, we show how the assumptions of our algorithm satisfy a sensible parametrization for a large class of problems in sequential recommendations.",0
"In this paper we present a new method for accelerating reinforcement learning algorithms on large state spaces. Our approach leverages posterior sampling, which is a technique that has been shown to speed up other types of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We demonstrate through experiments on a range of benchmark problems that our method can substantially reduce wallclock time while maintaining accuracy compared to standard methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our approach is easy to implement and requires only minor modifications to existing codebases.",1
"Off-policy learning is key to scaling up reinforcement learning as it allows to learn about a target policy from the experience generated by a different behavior policy. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to combine off-policy learning with function approximation and multi-step bootstrapping in a way that leads to both stable and efficient algorithms. In this work, we show that the \textsc{Tree Backup} and \textsc{Retrace} algorithms are unstable with linear function approximation, both in theory and in practice with specific examples. Based on our analysis, we then derive stable and efficient gradient-based algorithms using a quadratic convex-concave saddle-point formulation. By exploiting the problem structure proper to these algorithms, we are able to provide convergence guarantees and finite-sample bounds. The applicability of our new analysis also goes beyond \textsc{Tree Backup} and \textsc{Retrace} and allows us to provide new convergence rates for the GTD and GTD2 algorithms without having recourse to projections or Polyak averaging.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel method for backup and retrace using convergent tree methods and function approximation techniques. Our approach allows for efficient and effective data recovery in case of unexpected system failures or crashes, ensuring minimal downtime and maximum data integrity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm through extensive simulations and comparisons against traditional backups systems. Additionally, we discuss potential applications and future directions for improving backup systems based on our findings. By combining convergent trees with function approximations, we provide a powerful tool for data protection and disaster recovery that can meet the demands of modern computing environments.",1
"Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks.   Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown great promise in solving high-dimensional continuous control problems, but these methods often struggle with exploration and require large amounts of data to learn effective policies. To address these challenges, we propose using generalized advantage estimation (GAE), which allows us to efficiently train DRL agents on low-data regimes while still achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of domains.  Our method takes advantage of the fact that value functions can be decomposed into multiple components, each of which captures different aspects of the agent’s behavior. By estimating these components separately and combining them in a principled manner, we achieve better sample efficiency than traditional DRL methods. Furthermore, our algorithm allows for natural gradient updates, making it well-suited for continuous action spaces where vanilla policy gradients become computationally intractable.  We evaluate our approach on several benchmark tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, including acrobot, halfcheetah, hopper, ant, Walker2d, invertedpendulum, swingup, pendulum, and cartpole. Across all of these tasks, our GAE-based algorithm outperforms strong baselines such as SAC, TDC, and TRPO, requiring significantly fewer interactions with the environment to converge to optimal solutions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tackling complex continuous control problems with limited data.  Overall, our work provides a promising direction towards developing more efficient and robust RL algorithms for real-world applications that involve high-dimensional continuous actions and sparse rewards.",1
"Transportation and traffic are currently undergoing a rapid increase in terms of both scale and complexity. At the same time, an increasing share of traffic participants are being transformed into agents driven or supported by artificial intelligence resulting in mixed-intelligence traffic. This work explores the implications of distributed decision-making in mixed-intelligence traffic. The investigations are carried out on the basis of an online-simulated highway scenario, namely the MIT \emph{DeepTraffic} simulation. In the first step traffic agents are trained by means of a deep reinforcement learning approach, being deployed inside an elitist evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter search. The resulting architectures and training parameters are then utilized in order to either train a single autonomous traffic agent and transfer the learned weights onto a multi-agent scenario or else to conduct multi-agent learning directly. Both learning strategies are evaluated on different ratios of mixed-intelligence traffic. The strategies are assessed according to the average speed of all agents driven by artificial intelligence. Traffic patterns that provoke a reduction in traffic flow are analyzed with respect to the different strategies.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning techniques to improve traffic management systems. Two popular approaches that have emerged are transfer learning and multi-agent learning. This study compares these two methods on simulated highway networks in order to determine which approach leads to better distributed decision making. We find that both approaches can effectively reduce travel times and decrease congestion, but transfer learning outperforms multi-agent learning in terms of efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that further research into large-scale deployment of transfer learning algorithms could lead to significant improvements in urban transportation systems. ---",1
"We propose Ephemeral Value Adjusments (EVA): a means of allowing deep reinforcement learning agents to rapidly adapt to experience in their replay buffer. EVA shifts the value predicted by a neural network with an estimate of the value function found by planning over experience tuples from the replay buffer near the current state. EVA combines a number of recent ideas around combining episodic memory-like structures into reinforcement learning agents: slot-based storage, content-based retrieval, and memory-based planning. We show that EVAis performant on a demonstration task and Atari games.",0
"Title: Accelerating Deep Reinforcement Learning through Online Adjustments Based on Past Experience  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful approach for training agents to make complex decisions in uncertain environments. However, conventional DRL methods can often suffer from slow convergence rates, which limits their applicability in real-world settings where timely feedback is essential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that leverages online adjustments based on past experience to accelerate the training process. Our approach adapts the agent's behavior policy incrementally by fine-tuning its parameters using the error backpropagation technique. This allows the agent to quickly learn from previous experiences without having to restart the entire learning process. We evaluate our method using a variety of benchmark tasks and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. Our findings show that our proposed method achieves faster convergence rates while maintaining comparable levels of accuracy and robustness. Overall, our work provides important insights into how online adaptation can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of DRL algorithms in real-world applications.",1
"Reinforcement learning methods carry a well known bias-variance trade-off in n-step algorithms for optimal control. Unfortunately, this has rarely been addressed in current research. This trade-off principle holds independent of the choice of the algorithm, such as n-step SARSA, n-step Expected SARSA or n-step Tree backup. A small n results in a large bias, while a large n leads to large variance. The literature offers no straightforward recipe for the best choice of this value. While currently all n-step algorithms use a fixed value of n over the state space we extend the framework of n-step updates by allowing each state to have its specific n.   We propose a solution to this problem within the context of human aided reinforcement learning. Our approach is based on the observation that a human can learn more efficiently if she receives input regarding the criticality of a given state and thus the amount of attention she needs to invest into the learning in that state. This observation is related to the idea that each state of the MDP has a certain measure of criticality which indicates how much the choice of the action in that state influences the return. In our algorithm the RL agent utilizes the criticality measure, a function provided by a human trainer, in order to locally choose the best stepnumber n for the update of the Q function.",0
"While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise as a framework for training agents to perform complex tasks, there remains an open challenge in understanding how to identify and leverage critical aspects of the problem being solved. This paper introduces the concept of ""criticality"" as a new direction towards addressing this challenge by focusing on identifying key features that are essential for successful task completion. We propose a novel computational model based on hierarchical Bayesian inference that enables our agent to learn these critical features over time through a process of self-discovery. By explicitly reasoning about uncertainty and exploration in RL, we demonstrate that agents equipped with this capability can significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines across a range of challenging benchmark problems. Our work provides insights into the nature of generalization in RL and highlights promising directions for future research in the development of increasingly capable autonomous agents.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning enables algorithms to learn complex behavior, deal with continuous action spaces and find good strategies in environments with high dimensional state spaces. With deep reinforcement learning being an active area of research and many concurrent inventions, we decided to focus on a relatively simple robotic task to evaluate a set of ideas that might help to solve recent reinforcement learning problems. We test a newly created combination of two commonly used reinforcement learning methods, whether it is able to learn more effectively than a baseline. We also compare different ideas to preprocess information before it is fed to the reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of this strategy is to reduce training time and eventually help the algorithm to converge. The concluding evaluation proves the general applicability of the described concepts by testing them using a simulated environment. These concepts might be reused for future experiments.",0
"In this research study we propose using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to train robots to accurately control their manipulation actions. Traditional methods for robotic arm control have relied on rigid predefined trajectories which may not account for changing environments and dynamic obstacles. DRL algorithms allow agents to learn continuously from trial and error by maximizing a reward signal. We apply this approach to controlling four degrees of freedom (DoFs) on two commercially available robot arms: Shadow Dexterous Hand by Shadow Robot Company and Universal Robots UR3e. Both robot arms have been modified for this work such that they can receive raw sensor measurements as input rather than requiring processed data from sensors such as cameras, LIDARS, or tactile sensors. Our results show that despite operating without any prior knowledge beyond physics engine constraints, our trained agent was able to successfully control both robotic arms to perform tasks involving picking objects up and moving them into designated locations with high accuracy while optimizing reward signals. As the first comprehensive demonstration of applying DRL algorithms to robot arms, we hope these findings inspire future work exploring the application of DRL techniques for robotics to enable intelligent autonomous systems capable of performing complex manipulation tasks under real world conditions.",1
"How do humans navigate to target objects in novel scenes? Do we use the semantic/functional priors we have built over years to efficiently search and navigate? For example, to search for mugs, we search cabinets near the coffee machine and for fruits we try the fridge. In this work, we focus on incorporating semantic priors in the task of semantic navigation. We propose to use Graph Convolutional Networks for incorporating the prior knowledge into a deep reinforcement learning framework. The agent uses the features from the knowledge graph to predict the actions. For evaluation, we use the AI2-THOR framework. Our experiments show how semantic knowledge improves performance significantly. More importantly, we show improvement in generalization to unseen scenes and/or objects. The supplementary video can be accessed at the following link: https://youtu.be/otKjuO805dE .",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for navigation that leverages scene priors derived from semantic representations learned through deep neural networks. We introduce a new algorithm called VISSEM Nav which operates on three different levels: first, we extract dense features that encode object detection and categorization in real time; secondly, we apply classical computer vision techniques such as keypoint extraction and matching to compute a pose graph across frames; lastly, the extracted semantics are used to regularize and improve the accuracy of state estimation by refining the camera poses based on the location of objects. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements over traditional monocular visual odometry methods when applied to challenging indoor sequences where there may be occlusions or poor feature matches due to repetitive textures. Additionally, experiments show that our method achieves comparable performance when compared against state-of-the-art structure-from-motion pipelines but at a fraction of the computation cost. Overall, VISSEM Nav provides a powerful toolkit for creating autonomous agents capable of robust multi-room navigation tasks without relying exclusively on predefined maps or handcrafted environment descriptions. Finally, future work could explore integrating our system into larger architectures designed for robotic manipulation tasks such as furniture assembly or object retrieval applications.",1
"We identify two issues with the family of algorithms based on the Adversarial Imitation Learning framework. The first problem is implicit bias present in the reward functions used in these algorithms. While these biases might work well for some environments, they can also lead to sub-optimal behavior in others. Secondly, even though these algorithms can learn from few expert demonstrations, they require a prohibitively large number of interactions with the environment in order to imitate the expert for many real-world applications. In order to address these issues, we propose a new algorithm called Discriminator-Actor-Critic that uses off-policy Reinforcement Learning to reduce policy-environment interaction sample complexity by an average factor of 10. Furthermore, since our reward function is designed to be unbiased, we can apply our algorithm to many problems without making any task-specific adjustments.",0
"Adversarial imitation learning (AI) is a powerful technique that allows agents to learn from demonstrations provided by experts. However, traditional methods of adversarial imitation learning can suffer from sample efficiency problems, where the agent requires large amounts of data to converge on good policies. Additionally, these methods may encounter reward bias issues, where the demonstrated trajectories used for training provide biased rewards and cause the learned policy to be suboptimal.  This study proposes the use of discriminator actor critic methodology to address these problems. This approach consists of three components – a discriminator, which evaluates the quality of generated samples; an actor, which selects actions based on the evaluation by the discriminator; and a critic, which provides feedback to both the actor and discriminator to improve their performance over time.  Through experimentation using several benchmark tasks, we demonstrate how our proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of sample efficiency and robustness to reward bias. We show that our algorithm converges faster and achieves higher levels of performance compared to previous state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our framework is able to handle complex environments with continuous action spaces more effectively than other methods.  In conclusion, our work presents a new approach to address the challenges faced by adversarial imitation learning, improving upon current techniques in terms of sample efficiency and resilience to reward bias. Our findings have important implications for artificial intelligence researchers seeking to develop better reinforcement learning algorithms for real-world applications.",1

"This article presents research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which combines two powerful tools in artificial intelligence: deep neural networks and reinforcement learning algorithms. DRL has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to creating intelligent agents that can learn and act effectively in complex, uncertain environments. We begin by discussing the basics of traditional reinforcement learning, including the concepts of states, actions, rewards, and value functions. Next, we introduce deep neural networks and explain how they can be used to approximate Q values, which form the basis of many state-of-the-art RL algorithms. After discussing the challenges associated with training deep models using backpropagation through time, we present several solutions such as target network updates, experience reuse, and asynchronous learning. Finally, we survey recent advances in applying DRL to real-world problems in domains such as games, robotics, finance, and healthcare, highlighting both successes and limitations. By shedding light on these developments, we aim to inspire future work towards enabling even more advanced autonomous agents capable of achieving highly complex goals while interacting naturally within our world.",1
"Two of the leading approaches for model-free reinforcement learning are policy gradient methods and $Q$-learning methods. $Q$-learning methods can be effective and sample-efficient when they work, however, it is not well-understood why they work, since empirically, the $Q$-values they estimate are very inaccurate. A partial explanation may be that $Q$-learning methods are secretly implementing policy gradient updates: we show that there is a precise equivalence between $Q$-learning and policy gradient methods in the setting of entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, that ""soft"" (entropy-regularized) $Q$-learning is exactly equivalent to a policy gradient method. We also point out a connection between $Q$-learning methods and natural policy gradient methods. Experimentally, we explore the entropy-regularized versions of $Q$-learning and policy gradients, and we find them to perform as well as (or slightly better than) the standard variants on the Atari benchmark. We also show that the equivalence holds in practical settings by constructing a $Q$-learning method that closely matches the learning dynamics of A3C without using a target network or $\epsilon$-greedy exploration schedule.",0
"This paper shows that policy gradient methods can often lead to more efficient learning than soft Q-learning in problems where the action space has continuous dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate several examples where the two approaches give equivalent results, either because their updates cancel each other out or because they reduce to some common update rule such as stochastic gradient descent on the objective function itself. We provide experimental evidence supporting these claims across a variety of domains. Our work sheds light on the relationship between policy gradients and Q-learning, and provides new insight into how they compare in practice.",1
"Reinforcement learning methods require careful design involving a reward function to obtain the desired action policy for a given task. In the absence of hand-crafted reward functions, prior work on the topic has proposed several methods for reward estimation by using expert state trajectories and action pairs. However, there are cases where complete or good action information cannot be obtained from expert demonstrations. We propose a novel reinforcement learning method in which the agent learns an internal model of observation on the basis of expert-demonstrated state trajectories to estimate rewards without completely learning the dynamics of the external environment from state-action pairs. The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the given expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent predicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state and the state predicted by the internal model. We conducted multiple experiments in environments of varying complexity, including the Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird games. We show our method successfully trains good policies directly from expert game-play videos.",0
"Developing artificial intelligence systems that can perform complex tasks in uncertain environments requires efficient methods for reward shaping. Traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rewards which often fail to capture the nuances of real-world scenarios. This paper presents an alternative approach based on internal models, where agents learn to predict future states given their past observations. By leveraging these predictions as intrinsic motivation signals, we achieve better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse domains. We demonstrate our method’s effectiveness through simulation studies and experiments with robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that learned intrinsic rewards provide meaningful guidance during training and generalize well to unseen situations. Overall, our work highlights how internal model learning can enable more adaptive behavior in reinforcement learning settings.",1
"Sample efficiency is critical in solving real-world reinforcement learning problems, where agent-environment interactions can be costly. Imitation learning from expert advice has proved to be an effective strategy for reducing the number of interactions required to train a policy. Online imitation learning, which interleaves policy evaluation and policy optimization, is a particularly effective technique with provable performance guarantees. In this work, we seek to further accelerate the convergence rate of online imitation learning, thereby making it more sample efficient. We propose two model-based algorithms inspired by Follow-the-Leader (FTL) with prediction: MoBIL-VI based on solving variational inequalities and MoBIL-Prox based on stochastic first-order updates. These two methods leverage a model to predict future gradients to speed up policy learning. When the model oracle is learned online, these algorithms can provably accelerate the best known convergence rate up to an order. Our algorithms can be viewed as a generalization of stochastic Mirror-Prox (Juditsky et al., 2011), and admit a simple constructive FTL-style analysis of performance.",0
"In many real world applications such as robotics, imitation learning is often used to train agents by having them learn from human demonstrations. This method allows agents to quickly acquire new skills without explicitly programming each action individually but can suffer from slow convergence rates due to the model uncertainty associated with predicting the future states that an expert intends to demonstrate towards during training. Our work proposes two methods, which we call ""Ensemble Ensembling"" and ""Retrace Backups,"" designed to address these uncertainties using predictive models built on top of ensembled trajectories obtained via interaction rollouts. By doing so, our approach is able to significantly accelerate policy improvement compared to prior work while still maintaining comparable levels of performance across various tasks. We evaluate our techniques on both continuous control problems as well as discrete action domains. Overall, our contributions aim to make imitation learning more efficient for training robots and other autonomous systems through leveraging predictive models over ensembles of interactively generated data.",1
"Predicting movement of objects while the action of learning agent interacts with the dynamics of the scene still remains a key challenge in robotics. We propose a multi-layer Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoendocer network that predicts future frames for a robot navigating in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. The autoencoder network is composed of a state and action conditioned decoder network that reconstructs the future frames of video, conditioned on the action taken by the agent. The input image frames are first transformed into low dimensional feature vectors with a pre-trained encoder network and then reconstructed with the LSTM autoencoder network to generate the future frames. A virtual environment, based on the OpenAi-Gym framework for robotics, is used to gather training data and test the proposed network. The initial experiments show promising results indicating that these predicted frames can be used by an appropriate reinforcement learning framework in future to navigate around dynamic obstacles.",0

"E-learning systems are capable of providing more adaptive and efficient learning experiences for students than the traditional classroom setting. A key component of such systems is the learning strategy, the algorithm that designs the learning paths for students based on information such as the students' current progresses, their skills, learning materials, and etc. In this paper, we address the problem of finding the optimal learning strategy for an E-learning system. To this end, we first develop a model for students' hierarchical skills in the E-learning system. Based on the hierarchical skill model and the classical cognitive diagnosis model, we further develop a framework to model various proficiency levels of hierarchical skills. The optimal learning strategy on top of the hierarchical structure is found by applying a model-free reinforcement learning method, which does not require information on students' learning transition process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via numerical experiments.",0
"Abstract: (skip) Optimal Hierarchical Learning Path design problem can be formulated as finding a learning path that minimizes completion time given limited study resources. In many real life settings, students have access only to certain portions of course material at any point in time due to unavailable textbooks, online courses, etc. To model such scenarios where studying multiple modules simultaneously may not be possible, we assume each module has some prerequisites which must be completed before attempting to learn the next one. Motivated by these factors, we develop a novel reinforcement learning based approach that iteratively designs optimal hierarchical learning paths for any given course by considering both learning speed and resource availability constraints. Our method shows improved efficiency compared to existing methods by over 24% on average. Moreover, our analysis indicates the proposed algorithm balances exploration versus exploitation effectively while navigating large action spaces, thereby reducing potential solutions to mere hundreds instead of millions. These results make promising strides towards scalable educational technology systems capable of adapting to individual learner needs.",1
"Exploration is a difficult challenge in reinforcement learning and is of prime importance in sparse reward environments. However, many of the state of the art deep reinforcement learning algorithms, that rely on epsilon-greedy, fail on these environments. In such cases, empowerment can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to maximize the influence it has over the near future. We formulate empowerment as the channel capacity between states and actions and is calculated by estimating the mutual information between the actions and the following states. The mutual information is estimated using Mutual Information Neural Estimator and a forward dynamics model. We demonstrate that an empowerment driven agent is able to improve significantly the score of a baseline DQN agent on the game of Montezuma's Revenge.",0
"This paper presents a methodology that enables exploratory data analysis through the use of mutual information estimation and a principled definition of empowerment as decision making leverage. By measuring the amount of predictive information present in the remaining unexplored portion of a dataset, scientists can make informed decisions on which subset of the data may yield the most significant discoveries. Additionally, we show how our approach naturally leads to interpretable subsets selection metrics by computing the difference between their individual and collective empowerments. Finally, we demonstrate via real-world examples how the proposed framework effectively finds high impact interpretations from complex datasets, including brain signals recordings (EEG) during human movement control tasks and wind energy production forecasts based on environmental measurements.",1
"The smallest eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are well-known to provide a succinct representation of the geometry of a weighted graph. In reinforcement learning (RL), where the weighted graph may be interpreted as the state transition process induced by a behavior policy acting on the environment, approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian provides a promising approach to state representation learning. However, existing methods for performing this approximation are ill-suited in general RL settings for two main reasons: First, they are computationally expensive, often requiring operations on large matrices. Second, these methods lack adequate justification beyond simple, tabular, finite-state settings. In this paper, we present a fully general and scalable method for approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in a model-free RL context. We systematically evaluate our approach and empirically show that it generalizes beyond the tabular, finite-state setting. Even in tabular, finite-state settings, its ability to approximate the eigenvectors outperforms previous proposals. Finally, we show the potential benefits of using a Laplacian representation learned using our method in goal-achieving RL tasks, providing evidence that our technique can be used to significantly improve the performance of an RL agent.",0

DQV models have shown promising results across several domains including image generation, game playing, and text completion tasks. Furthermore, by explicitly incorporating user feedback into the model, these systems can better align their behavior with human expectations and preferences. Overall, DQV learning offers a powerful framework for building intelligent agents that can adapt to complex environments while prioritizing ethical considerations and human values.",1
"The enactive approach to cognition is typically proposed as a viable alternative to traditional cognitive science. Enactive cognition displaces the explanatory focus from the internal representations of the agent to the direct sensorimotor interaction with its environment. In this paper, we investigate enactive learning through means of artificial agent simulations. We compare the performances of the enactive agent to an agent operating on classical reinforcement learning in foraging tasks within maze environments. The characteristics of the agents are analysed in terms of the accessibility of the environmental states, goals, and exploration/exploitation tradeoffs. We confirm that the enactive agent can successfully interact with its environment and learn to avoid unfavourable interactions using intrinsically defined goals. The performance of the enactive agent is shown to be limited by the number of affordable actions.",0

"Consider an assistive system that guides visually impaired users through speech and haptic feedback to their destination. Existing robotic and ubiquitous navigation technologies (e.g., portable, ground, or wearable systems) often operate in a generic, user-agnostic manner. However, to minimize confusion and navigation errors, our real-world analysis reveals a crucial need to adapt the instructional guidance across different end-users with diverse mobility skills. To address this practical issue in scalable system design, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for personalizing the system-user interaction experience. When incrementally adapting the system to new users, we propose to use a weighted experts model for addressing data-efficiency limitations in transfer learning with deep models. A real-world dataset of navigation by blind users is used to show that the proposed approach allows for (1) more accurate long-term human behavior prediction (up to 20 seconds into the future) through improved reasoning over personal mobility characteristics, interaction with surrounding obstacles, and the current navigation goal, and (2) quick adaptation at the onset of learning, when data is limited.",0

"In statistical modelling the biggest threat is concept drift which makes the model gradually showing deteriorating performance over time. There are state of the art methodologies to detect the impact of concept drift, however general strategy considered to overcome the issue in performance is to rebuild or re-calibrate the model periodically as the variable patterns for the model changes significantly due to market change or consumer behavior change etc. Quantitative research is the most widely spread application of data science in Marketing or financial domain where applicability of state of the art reinforcement learning for auto-learning is less explored paradigm. Reinforcement learning is heavily dependent on having a simulated environment which is majorly available for gaming or online systems, to learn from the live feedback. However, there are some research happened on the area of online advertisement, pricing etc where due to the nature of the online learning environment scope of reinforcement learning is explored. Our proposed solution is a reinforcement learning based, true self-learning algorithm which can adapt to the data change or concept drift and auto learn and self-calibrate for the new patterns of the data solving the problem of concept drift.

"Artificial intelligence has been rapidly evolving over recent years due to advances in machine learning techniques and algorithms that enable machines to learn from experience and improve their performance through trial and error. Among these methods, reinforcement evolutionary learning stands out as particularly promising for enabling self-learning systems that can adapt to new situations and tasks autonomously. In this study, we propose a novel method based on reinforcement evolutionary learning which allows artificial agents to optimize their behavior by maximizing cumulative reward gained throughout the entire learning process. Our approach combines genetic algorithm and Q-Learning, two popular machine learning paradigms that have proven effective individually in solving different problems, into one hybrid model able to tackle more complex tasks. We evaluate our method using simulation experiments in several domains including robot control, games, and decision making under uncertainty. Results show significant improvement compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed framework. This research contributes to understanding how artificial agents could become more efficient in acquiring knowledge from interactions with dynamic environments while significantly reducing human intervention. With further development and experimentation, our method may open up possibilities for designing intelligent systems capable of continuous adaptation without explicit programming, paving the way towards advanced forms of autonomy and agency in artificial intelligence.",1
"In this paper we obtain several informative error bounds on function approximation for the policy evaluation algorithm proposed by Basu et al. when the aim is to find the risk-sensitive cost represented using exponential utility. The main idea is to use classical Bapat's inequality and to use Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors (exists if we assume irreducible Markov chain) to get the new bounds. The novelty of our approach is that we use the irreduciblity of Markov chain to get the new bounds whereas the earlier work by Basu et al. used spectral variation bound which is true for any matrix. We also give examples where all our bounds achieve the ""actual error"" whereas the earlier bound given by Basu et al. is much weaker in comparison. We show that this happens due to the absence of difference term in the earlier bound which is always present in all our bounds when the state space is large. Additionally, we discuss how all our bounds compare with each other. As a corollary of our main result we provide a bound between largest eigenvalues of two irreducibile matrices in terms of the matrix entries.",0
"Function approximation errors arise when using approximate models in complex environments, such as those encountered in risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL). These approximations can significantly impact RL algorithms, leading to suboptimal policies that fail to account for the true underlying risks present in the environment. This study analyzes the relationship between function approximation errors and their effect on risk-sensitive RL, providing insights into how these errors impact policy performance and identifying methods to mitigate their effects. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of accurately addressing function approximation errors in risk-sensitive RL, ensuring more reliable and robust policies that better align with desired objectives. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of how function approximation errors influence decision making under uncertainty in RL, offering new directions for improving algorithm design and performance evaluation.",1
"Model-free approaches for reinforcement learning (RL) and continuous control find policies based only on past states and rewards, without fitting a model of the system dynamics. They are appealing as they are general purpose and easy to implement; however, they also come with fewer theoretical guarantees than model-based RL. In this work, we present a new model-free algorithm for controlling linear quadratic (LQ) systems, and show that its regret scales as $O(T^{\xi+2/3})$ for any small $\xi0$ if time horizon satisfies $TC^{1/\xi}$ for a constant $C$. The algorithm is based on a reduction of control of Markov decision processes to an expert prediction problem. In practice, it corresponds to a variant of policy iteration with forced exploration, where the policy in each phase is greedy with respect to the average of all previous value functions. This is the first model-free algorithm for adaptive control of LQ systems that provably achieves sublinear regret and has a polynomial computation cost. Empirically, our algorithm dramatically outperforms standard policy iteration, but performs worse than a model-based approach.",0
"Linear quadratic control (LQC) problems play an important role in model predictive control and other applications, where they serve as the central building block in solving optimal control problems. Recent research has aimed at leveraging machine learning techniques to improve performance while reducing computational complexity. However, these approaches often require explicit knowledge of the underlying system dynamics, which can be challenging to obtain and maintain. This paper presents a new approach that uses expert prediction models to approximate the state costs and transition probabilities required by LQR/T algorithms without assuming any specific functional forms for these quantities. The proposed method enables efficient, accurate, and data-driven linear quadratic optimization using only simple supervised learning techniques on offline demonstrations. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and generality of our framework across diverse domains, including continuous, hybrid, discrete, nonlinear, partially observable, and high dimensional systems. Our results suggest that the use of learned predictions instead of exact system representations may enable real-time control in complex environments, even if precise dynamics are unknown or difficult to compute online.",1
"Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach to extend traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve more complex tasks. Yet, the majority of current HRL methods require careful task-specific design and on-policy training, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in that they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with modest numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for real-world problems such as robotic control. For generality, we develop a scheme where lower-level controllers are supervised with goals that are learned and proposed automatically by the higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we propose to use off-policy experience for both higher and lower-level training. This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the lower-level behaviors change the action space for the higher-level policy, and we introduce an off-policy correction to remedy this challenge. This allows us to take advantage of recent advances in off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher- and lower-level policies using substantially fewer environment interactions than on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find that it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our experiments show that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex behaviors for simulated robots, such as pushing objects and utilizing them to reach target locations, learning from only a few million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time interaction. In comparisons with a number of prior HRL methods, we find that our approach substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant progress towards solving complex tasks using large amounts of data and computational resources. However, many real world applications such as robotics and autonomous systems require efficient exploration of environments while minimizing both time and resource consumption. This work presents a novel approach to hierarchical RL that utilizes a hybrid model-free and model-based framework to efficiently learn high level policies that generalize across multiple domains. By leveraging episodic memory and iterative planning, our algorithm improves sample efficiency and enables effective exploration through task decomposition at varying levels of abstraction. Experimental results demonstrate successful transfer across simulation domains, outperforming standard HRL methods on continuous control benchmarks. Overall, our method offers a promising solution to real world decision making under limited information availability.",1
"Recent analyses of certain gradient descent optimization methods have shown that performance can degrade in some settings - such as with stochasticity or implicit momentum. In deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), such optimization methods are often used for training neural networks via the temporal difference error or policy gradient. As an agent improves over time, the optimization target changes and thus the loss landscape (and local optima) change. Due to the failure modes of those methods, the ideal choice of optimizer for Deep RL remains unclear. As such, we provide an empirical analysis of the effects that a wide range of gradient descent optimizers and their hyperparameters have on policy gradient methods, a subset of Deep RL algorithms, for benchmark continuous control tasks. We find that adaptive optimizers have a narrow window of effective learning rates, diverging in other cases, and that the effectiveness of momentum varies depending on the properties of the environment. Our analysis suggests that there is significant interplay between the dynamics of the environment and Deep RL algorithm properties which aren't necessarily accounted for by traditional adaptive gradient methods. We provide suggestions for optimal settings of current methods and further lines of research based on our findings.",0
"This paper presents an empirical analysis of gradient descent optimization in policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning (RL). We investigate how different choices in algorithm design can affect performance on RL benchmark tasks, including variations in learning rates, batch sizes, architectures, and regularization techniques. Our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for tuning these hyperparameters, as some combinations lead to worse performance than random search across all tested environments. Additionally, we observe that certain algorithms may perform well on average but fail catastrophically on specific problem instances. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering both algorithmic details and evaluation metrics when developing new RL methods.",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods are succeeding in a growing number of tasks, aided by recent advances in deep learning. However, they tend to suffer from high sample complexity, which hinders their use in real-world domains. Alternatively, model-based reinforcement learning promises to reduce sample complexity, but tends to require careful tuning and to date have succeeded mainly in restrictive domains where simple models are sufficient for learning. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of vanilla model-based reinforcement learning methods when deep neural networks are used to learn both the model and the policy, and show that the learned policy tends to exploit regions where insufficient data is available for the model to be learned, causing instability in training. To overcome this issue, we propose to use an ensemble of models to maintain the model uncertainty and regularize the learning process. We further show that the use of likelihood ratio derivatives yields much more stable learning than backpropagation through time. Altogether, our approach Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO) significantly reduces the sample complexity compared to model-free deep RL methods on challenging continuous control benchmark tasks.",0
"One popular method used by humans to train machine learning models is policy gradient reinforcement learning. This allows agents trained using deep neural networks to learn from trial and error how to perform complex tasks. There are numerous algorithms that can be used for training under model ensembles, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, Adagrad, Nadam, etc., as well as different optimization methods such as cross entropy method (CEM) and evolutionary computation based on genetic algorithms (GA). Using these algorithms, human scientists have been able to achieve state-of-the-art results in multiple domains, including games like Go and Atari video games. These advances demonstrate the great potential of AIs to solve challenging problems. In future research we should continue exploring new algorithmic combinations and developing better ways of selecting hyperparameters.",1
"Designing optimal controllers continues to be challenging as systems are becoming complex and are inherently nonlinear. The principal advantage of reinforcement learning (RL) is its ability to learn from the interaction with the environment and provide optimal control strategy. In this paper, RL is explored in the context of control of the benchmark cartpole dynamical system with no prior knowledge of the dynamics. RL algorithms such as temporal-difference, policy gradient actor-critic, and value function approximation are compared in this context with the standard LQR solution. Further, we propose a novel approach to integrate RL and swing-up controllers.",0
"In this work we examine several state of the art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on their ability to solve the cart pole balancing task. Specifically we investigate Deep Q Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and Synchronous Advantage Actor Critic (SAAC). Each algorithm is trained with 2 different exploration strategies: epsilon greedy exploration with decaying factor and Boltzmann Exploration policy based on entropy regularized RL objective. We compare each combination and analyze their convergence rate, stability during training, performance on validation set and sample efficiency. Results show that DQN achieves higher final performance compared to other methods but has slowest convergence speed and suffers from instability during training due to overshoot. SAAC is most stable method overall and demonstrates fastest convergence rate however it underperforms compared to other algorithms. Both exploration strategies have similar impact on resulting performance; epsilon greedy performs slightly better than Boltzmann exploration. Lastly we provide visualizations comparing learned policies and value function heatmaps which could help researchers identify key differences between these algorithms leading to improved understanding. Ultimately our experiments demonstrate tradeoffs between performance, robustness, and theoretical appeal among popular modern RL approaches. Future work should focus on developing more theoretically grounded yet computationally efficient techniques capable of matching contemporary deep learning architectures used by top performing models like those found herein.",1
"In an RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio network, multiple secondary users communicate with a secondary gateway by backscattering or harvesting energy and actively transmitting their data depending on the primary channel state. To coordinate the transmission of multiple secondary transmitters, the secondary gateway needs to schedule the backscattering time, energy harvesting time, and transmission time among them. However, under the dynamics of the primary channel and the uncertainty of the energy state of the secondary transmitters, it is challenging for the gateway to find a time scheduling mechanism which maximizes the total throughput. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive an optimal time scheduling policy for the gateway. Specifically, to deal with the problem with large state and action spaces, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that enables the gateway to learn the optimal policy. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms non-learning schemes in terms of network throughput.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to time scheduling in cognitive radio networks using deep reinforcement learning. In these types of networks, communication nodes use reflected energy from transmitting sources as their power source rather than battery power. However, because they rely on external signals, these networks can suffer from interference that disrupts communication. Our proposed method uses deep neural network (DNN) agents trained through reinforcement learning to develop time schedules that maximize data transmission while minimizing interference. We evaluate our system through simulations and show that it outperforms traditional methods such as genetic algorithms in terms of both throughput and stability. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining machine learning techniques with wireless networking systems to improve efficiency and performance.",1
"Many recent algorithms for reinforcement learning are model-free and founded on the Bellman equation. Here we present a method founded on the costate equation and models of the state dynamics. We use the costate -- the gradient of cost with respect to state -- to improve the policy and also to ""focus"" the model, training it to detect and mimic those features of the environment that are most relevant to its task. We show that this method can handle difficult time-optimal control problems, driving deterministic or stochastic mechanical systems quickly to a target. On these tasks it works well compared to deep deterministic policy gradient, a recent Bellman method. And because it creates a model, the costate method can also learn from mental practice.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing models that can capture complex dependencies among variables in high-dimensional spaces. One approach to addressing this challenge is through costate-focused modeling. Costate-focused models extend traditional Markov decision processes by introducing additional state variables, known as ""costates,"" which represent the gradients of the value function with respect to the original states. These models offer several advantages over standard MDPs, including improved robustness to uncertainty and better ability to handle nonlinear dynamics. This paper presents two new methods for using costate-focused models in reinforcement learning: QCostate and SARSA-CFA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms on a range of benchmark tasks and show that they outperform existing RL methods, even those specifically designed for handling higher dimensional problems. Our results suggest that costate-focused modeling is a promising direction for advancing the field of RL and solving more difficult real-world problems.",1
"Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in generalizing over raw sensory data using only a single neural network for value optimization. There are several challenges in the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms that prevent them from converging towards the global optima. It is likely that the solution to these problems lies in short- and long-term planning, exploration and memory management for reinforcement learning algorithms. Games are often used to benchmark reinforcement learning algorithms as they provide a flexible, reproducible, and easy to control environment. Regardless, few games feature a state-space where results in exploration, memory, and planning are easily perceived. This paper presents The Dreaming Variational Autoencoder (DVAE), a neural network based generative modeling architecture for exploration in environments with sparse feedback. We further present Deep Maze, a novel and flexible maze engine that challenges DVAE in partial and fully-observable state-spaces, long-horizon tasks, and deterministic and stochastic problems.

"We study a reinforcement learning setting, where the state transition function is a convex combination of a stochastic continuous function and a deterministic function. Such a setting generalizes the widely-studied stochastic state transition setting, namely the setting of deterministic policy gradient (DPG).   We firstly give a simple example to illustrate that the deterministic policy gradient may be infinite under deterministic state transitions, and introduce a theoretical technique to prove the existence of the policy gradient in this generalized setting. Using this technique, we prove that the deterministic policy gradient indeed exists for a certain set of discount factors, and further prove two conditions that guarantee the existence for all discount factors. We then derive a closed form of the policy gradient whenever exists. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of high sample complexity of DPG in this setting, we propose the Generalized Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDPG) algorithm. The main innovation of the algorithm is a new method of applying model-based techniques to the model-free algorithm, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). GDPG optimize the long-term rewards of the model-based augmented MDP subject to a constraint that the long-rewards of the MDP is less than the original one.   We finally conduct extensive experiments comparing GDPG with state-of-the-art methods and the direct model-based extension method of DDPG on several standard continuous control benchmarks. Results demonstrate that GDPG substantially outperforms DDPG, the model-based extension of DDPG and other baselines in terms of both convergence and long-term rewards in most environments.",0
"Abstract:  Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully used in many applications, including robotics, games, and finance. However, most existing RL methods suffer from high sample complexity, meaning they require large amounts of data to find good policies. In addition, these methods often rely on randomness in state transitions, making them difficult to use in real world scenarios where state transition probabilities may be unknown or stochastic.  To address these issues, we propose a deterministic policy gradient algorithm that can learn optimal policies with significantly fewer samples than traditional Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based methods. Our approach uses general state transitions instead of relying solely on the randomness inherent in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). This allows us to efficiently compute gradients based on trajectory rollouts without the need for sampling. We show through extensive experiments that our method outperforms both model-free and model-based baselines across several domains, including Atari games and continuous control tasks. Our work demonstrates the potential for deterministic policy gradients to achieve better performance while reducing computational requirements in RL.",1
"Reinforcement learning and planning methods require an objective or reward function that encodes the desired behavior. Yet, in practice, there is a wide range of scenarios where an objective is difficult to provide programmatically, such as tasks with visual observations involving unknown object positions or deformable objects. In these cases, prior methods use engineered problem-specific solutions, e.g., by instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to measure a proxy for the objective. Such solutions require a significant engineering effort on a per-task basis, and make it impractical for robots to continuously learn complex skills outside of laboratory settings. We aim to find a more general and scalable solution for specifying goals for robot learning in unconstrained environments. To that end, we formulate the few-shot objective learning problem, where the goal is to learn a task objective from only a few example images of successful end states for that task. We propose a simple solution to this problem: meta-learn a classifier that can recognize new goals from a few examples. We show how this approach can be used with both model-free reinforcement learning and visual model-based planning and show results in three domains: rope manipulation from images in simulation, visual navigation in a simulated 3D environment, and object arrangement into user-specified configurations on a real robot.",0
"This paper addresses the problem of few-shot goal inference for visuo-motor learning and planning. By leveraging advances in deep reinforcement learning and computer vision techniques, we propose a novel approach that can accurately identify goals from a small number of examples. Our method learns to predict the expected trajectory of objects and uses these predictions to infer goals based on their similarity to prior observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both simulated robots and real world tasks. Results show that our algorithm outperforms existing approaches and allows for more efficient and flexible learning and planning in complex environments. Overall, this work has important implications for robotics and artificial intelligence applications where adaptability and generalization across domains are crucial.",1
"We propose a probabilistic framework to directly insert prior knowledge in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms by defining the behaviour policy as a Bayesian posterior distribution. Such a posterior combines task specific information with prior knowledge, thus allowing to achieve transfer learning across tasks. The resulting method is flexible and it can be easily incorporated to any standard off-policy and on-policy algorithms, such as those based on temporal differences and policy gradients. We develop a specific instance of this Bayesian transfer RL framework by expressing prior knowledge as general deterministic rules that can be useful in a large variety of tasks, such as navigation tasks. Also, we elaborate more on recent probabilistic and entropy-regularised RL by developing a novel temporal learning algorithm and show how to combine it with Bayesian transfer RL. Finally, we demonstrate our method for solving mazes and show that significant speed ups can be obtained.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in real-world applications. However, many existing methods face challenges such as sample complexity and instability when dealing with continuous control problems that have high dimensional state spaces or complex reward functions. To address these issues, we propose a new approach called Bayesian transfer RL with prior knowledge rules (BTL). BTL integrates prior knowledge into model training by formulating a set of prior knowledge rules based on expert demonstrations or human preferences, which can effectively guide exploration during policy learning. By combining both task-specific experience and prior knowledge, our method significantly improves upon traditional actor critic methods. We show through simulation experiments that BTL substantially reduces sample efficiency compared to several baseline algorithms while achieving better performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of incorporating prior knowledge into deep RL systems, and suggest future directions towards more general and efficient autonomous agents.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has become a powerful strategy to solve complex decision making problems based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, it is highly data demanding, so unfeasible in physical systems for most applications. In this work, we approach an alternative Interactive Machine Learning (IML) strategy for training DNN policies based on human corrective feedback, with a method called Deep COACH (D-COACH). This approach not only takes advantage of the knowledge and insights of human teachers as well as the power of DNNs, but also has no need of a reward function (which sometimes implies the need of external perception for computing rewards). We combine Deep Learning with the COrrective Advice Communicated by Humans (COACH) framework, in which non-expert humans shape policies by correcting the agent's actions during execution. The D-COACH framework has the potential to solve complex problems without much data or time required. Experimental results validated the efficiency of the framework in three different problems (two simulated, one with a real robot), with state spaces of low and high dimensions, showing the capacity to successfully learn policies for continuous action spaces like in the Car Racing and Cart-Pole problems faster than with DRL.",0
"As deep neural networks (DNNs) become increasingly popular, they continue to face challenges related to their safety and reliability. These challenges arise due to their opacity and poor interpretability which can lead to unexpected behavior and lack of trust by users. To address these issues, researchers have proposed methods that allow DNNs to learn from interactive feedback while maintaining high levels of performance. In particular, one approach has been to use corrective feedback from human experts to improve the accuracy of policies learned by DNNs. This work presents a methodology for using interactive learning with corrective feedback to train policies based on deep neural networks. Our results show significant improvements over traditional supervised learning approaches and demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating expert knowledge into the training process. By providing more reliable and transparent models, our approach offers promising solutions for enhancing user trust and confidence in the use of machine learning systems.",1
"Learning in sparse reward settings remains a challenge in Reinforcement Learning, which is often addressed by using intrinsic rewards. One promising strategy is inspired by human curiosity, requiring the agent to learn to predict the future. In this paper a curiosity-driven agent is extended to use these predictions directly for training. To achieve this, the agent predicts the value function of the next state at any point in time. Subsequently, the consistency of this prediction with the current value function is measured, which is then used as a regularization term in the loss function of the algorithm. Experiments were made on grid-world environments as well as on a 3D navigation task, both with sparse rewards. In the first case the extended agent is able to learn significantly faster than the baselines.",0
"In this paper we propose a new method for improving curiosity driven deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms by incorporating state prediction errors as a regularizer during training. We introduce two methods: i) value prediction error (VPE), which uses model predictions of Q values of future states achieved from actions taken at the current state; ii) action prediction error (APE), which relies on model predictions of the agent’s own next action taken at each step given some context. VPE and APE help reduce overfitting and increase sample efficiency in deep RL agents trained using curiosity maximizing objectives such as inverse temperature parameterized novelty search (NS) and predictive information gain (PIG). Our approach demonstrates improved performance across several benchmark problems compared against prior work that did not use any form of regularization. Furthermore, our findings provide insights into how different sources of uncertainty can influence agent behavior and affect exploration strategies in RL. By utilizing explicit models of prediction uncertainty to guide exploratory behavior, we demonstrate one possible path towards building more generalizable RL algorithms capable of solving complex tasks without excessively large data requirements or hand engineering of intrinsically motivated reward functions.",1
"Reinforcement learning refers to a group of methods from artificial intelligence where an agent performs learning through trial and error. It differs from supervised learning, since reinforcement learning requires no explicit labels; instead, the agent interacts continuously with its environment. That is, the agent starts in a specific state and then performs an action, based on which it transitions to a new state and, depending on the outcome, receives a reward. Different strategies (e.g. Q-learning) have been proposed to maximize the overall reward, resulting in a so-called policy, which defines the best possible action in each state. Mathematically, this process can be formalized by a Markov decision process and it has been implemented by packages in R; however, there is currently no package available for reinforcement learning. As a remedy, this paper demonstrates how to perform reinforcement learning in R and, for this purpose, introduces the ReinforcementLearning package. The package provides a remarkably flexible framework and is easily applied to a wide range of different problems. We demonstrate its use by drawing upon common examples from the literature (e.g. finding optimal game strategies).",0

"Building deep reinforcement learning agents that can generalize and adapt to unseen environments remains a fundamental challenge for AI. This paper describes progresses on this challenge in the context of man-made environments, which are visually diverse but contain intrinsic semantic regularities. We propose a hybrid model-based and model-free approach, LEArning and Planning with Semantics (LEAPS), consisting of a multi-target sub-policy that acts on visual inputs, and a Bayesian model over semantic structures. When placed in an unseen environment, the agent plans with the semantic model to make high-level decisions, proposes the next sub-target for the sub-policy to execute, and updates the semantic model based on new observations. We perform experiments in visual navigation tasks using House3D, a 3D environment that contains diverse human-designed indoor scenes with real-world objects.

"This paper proposes an exploration method for deep reinforcement learning based on parameter space noise. Recent studies have experimentally shown that parameter space noise results in better exploration than the commonly used action space noise. Previous methods devised a way to update the diagonal covariance matrix of a noise distribution and did not consider the direction of the noise vector and its correlation. In addition, fast updates of the noise distribution are required to facilitate policy learning. We propose a method that deforms the noise distribution according to the accumulated returns and the noises that have led to the returns. Moreover, this method switches isotropic exploration and directional exploration in parameter space with regard to obtained rewards. We validate our exploration strategy in the OpenAI Gym continuous environments and modified environments with sparse rewards. The proposed method achieves results that are competitive with a previous method at baseline tasks. Moreover, our approach exhibits better performance in sparse reward environments by exploration with the switching strategy.",0
"Incorporate into your text at least these concepts: exploration strategies, deep reinforcement learning, directional exploration, parameter space noise, isotropic exploration. --- This study examines two common exploration strategies used in deep reinforcement learning (DRL): isotropic and directional exploration. Isotropic exploration involves randomly sampling actions from all available options without any prioritization, while directional exploration focuses on learning which actions lead to better outcomes based on their proximity to previously taken actions. Both approaches have their advantages and limitations, but how they interact with each other remains unclear. This work seeks to address that gap by studying how incorporating both types of exploration can improve performance in noisy environments. Specifically, we introduce parameter space noise, where random variations occur during training that disrupt traditional DRL algorithms. Our findings show that combining these two methods leads to more robust solutions that generalize better across different environments and achieve higher returns overall. These results highlight the importance of using multiple exploration strategies in complex DRL tasks, particularly those subject to uncertainty.",1
"Modern vision-based reinforcement learning techniques often use convolutional neural networks (CNN) as universal function approximators to choose which action to take for a given visual input.

Here, in the discrete action ATARI domain, we demonstrate, for the first time, that low precision policy distillation from a high precision network provides a principled, practical way to train an RL agent. As an application, on 10 different ATARI games, we demonstrate real-time end-to-end game playing on low-power neuromorphic hardware by converting a sequence of game frames into discrete actions.",0
"This paper presents a method for policy distillation that can work with low precision computations. We show how our approach can be applied to real-world systems like sensation-cognition-action loops running on neuromorphic computing platforms, which require efficient processing while maintaining high performance. Our approach involves training a large model using high precision computations, then distilling the knowledge into a smaller network that can run efficiently on low power hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on several benchmark tasks, showing that our approach can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly less compute resources. Our work has important implications for applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles where real-time decision making is critical but computational budgets are limited by energy constraints.",1
"In the real world, agents often have to operate in situations with incomplete information, limited sensing capabilities, and inherently stochastic environments, making individual observations incomplete and unreliable. Moreover, in many situations it is preferable to delay a decision rather than run the risk of making a bad decision. In such situations it is necessary to aggregate information before taking an action; however, most state of the art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are biased towards taking actions \textit{at every time step}, even if the agent is not particularly confident in its chosen action. This lack of caution can lead the agent to make critical mistakes, regardless of prior experience and acclimation to the environment. Motivated by theories of dynamic resolution of uncertainty during decision making in biological brains, we propose a simple accumulator module which accumulates evidence in favor of each possible decision, encodes uncertainty as a dynamic competition between actions, and acts on the environment only when it is sufficiently confident in the chosen action. The agent makes no decision by default, and the burden of proof to make a decision falls on the policy to accrue evidence strongly in favor of a single decision. Our results show that this accumulator module achieves near-optimal performance on a simple guessing game, far outperforming deep recurrent networks using traditional, forced action selection policies.",0
"This paper explores how evidence accumulation can enable safe reinforcement learning by providing agents with more accurate knowledge of their environment and reducing the risk of errors that could result from incomplete understanding. We examine two classic evidence accumulation models (Drugowitsch et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2019) in the context of reinforcement learning and show how they significantly improve performance compared to traditional methods that rely on fixed confidence thresholds. Our results demonstrate that these improvements arise because agents using evidence accumulation learn more efficiently, make better use of available data, and take less risky actions as they gain more experience. These findings have important implications for both theoretical understanding and practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms in real-world environments where safety and reliability are critical factors.",1
"Epistasis (gene-gene interaction) is crucial to predicting genetic disease. Our work tackles the computational challenges faced by previous works in epistasis detection by modeling it as a one-step Markov Decision Process where the state is genome data, the actions are the interacted genes, and the reward is an interaction measurement for the selected actions. A reinforcement learning agent using policy gradient method then learns to discover a set of highly interacted genes.",0
"EpiRL: A Reinforcement Learning Agent to Facilitate Epistasis Detection is a new approach that addresses the complex problem of epistasis detection by utilizing reinforcement learning techniques. Epistasis refers to interactions among genetic variants that lead to nonadditive effects on phenotype, making identifying them crucial in human genomics research. Current methods rely heavily on statistical models and computationally expensive searches that can fail to capture subtle interactions due to limitations in modeling assumptions. Our proposed agent, EpiRL, takes advantage of deep neural networks trained with Q-learning, allowing it to learn optimal search strategies effectively and efficiently, even across datasets with varying degrees of complexity. In this study, we demonstrate through simulations and real data experiments the effectiveness of our method compared to existing approaches, showing significant improvement in detecting epistatic interactions accurately, consistently, and robustly. By providing a powerful alternative framework for epistasis detection, EpiRL has promising applications in precision medicine where understanding gene-gene interactions is essential. Overall, this work presents a unique perspective using machine learning techniques that bridge genetics and computer science disciplines towards solving biological problems.",1
"Modern information technology services largely depend on cloud infrastructures to provide their services. These cloud infrastructures are built on top of datacenter networks (DCNs) constructed with high-speed links, fast switching gear, and redundancy to offer better flexibility and resiliency. In this environment, network traffic includes long-lived (elephant) and short-lived (mice) flows with partitioned and aggregated traffic patterns. Although SDN-based approaches can efficiently allocate networking resources for such flows, the overhead due to network reconfiguration can be significant. With limited capacity of Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) deployed in an OpenFlow enabled switch, it is crucial to determine which forwarding rules should remain in the flow table, and which rules should be processed by the SDN controller in case of a table-miss on the SDN switch. This is needed in order to obtain the flow entries that satisfy the goal of reducing the long-term control plane overhead introduced between the controller and the switches. To achieve this goal, we propose a machine learning technique that utilizes two variations of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms-the first of which is traditional reinforcement learning algorithm based while the other is deep reinforcement learning based. Emulation results using the RL algorithm show around 60% improvement in reducing the long-term control plane overhead, and around 14% improvement in the table-hit ratio compared to the Multiple Bloom Filters (MBF) method given a fixed size flow table of 4KB.",0
"Incorporating reinforcement learning into Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in network management. One such area that can benefit from this integration is flow entry management. Traditional methods for managing flows entries involve manual configuration by network administrators who must determine rules based on specific conditions. This approach can become overwhelming as networks grow larger and more complex. With reinforcement learning, flow entry management becomes automated through a machine learning algorithm that learns how to make decisions based on observed data. By leveraging this technology, network performance and efficiency can be improved while reducing human error. This research presents experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of using reinforcement learning for flow entry management in SDNs. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches and has the potential to significantly impact network design and operation.",1
"Autonomous cyber-physical agents and systems play an increasingly large role in our lives. To ensure that agents behave in ways aligned with the values of the societies in which they operate, we must develop techniques that allow these agents to not only maximize their reward in an environment, but also to learn and follow the implicit constraints of society. These constraints and norms can come from any number of sources including regulations, business process guidelines, laws, ethical principles, social norms, and moral values. We detail a novel approach that uses inverse reinforcement learning to learn a set of unspecified constraints from demonstrations of the task, and reinforcement learning to learn to maximize the environment rewards. More precisely, we assume that an agent can observe traces of behavior of members of the society but has no access to the explicit set of constraints that give rise to the observed behavior. Inverse reinforcement learning is used to learn such constraints, that are then combined with a possibly orthogonal value function through the use of a contextual bandit-based orchestrator that picks a contextually-appropriate choice between the two policies (constraint-based and environment reward-based) when taking actions. The contextual bandit orchestrator allows the agent to mix policies in novel ways, taking the best actions from either a reward maximizing or constrained policy. In addition, the orchestrator is transparent on which policy is being employed at each time step. We test our algorithms using a Pac-Man domain and show that the agent is able to learn to act optimally, act within the demonstrated constraints, and mix these two functions in complex ways.",0
"This study proposes a method for interpreting multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) through policy orchestration. The approach involves decomposing the original problem into subproblems that can each be solved using single-objective RL algorithms, and then coordinating these solutions to achieve the overall objective. By doing so, we aim to improve both interpretability and efficiency of multi-objective RL. Empirical evaluation on several benchmark problems shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach allows for intuitive interpretation of the learned policies, making them more accessible to humans. Overall, our work represents an important step towards building more transparent and effective RL systems for real-world applications.",1
"In this paper, we investigate a new form of automated curriculum learning based on adaptive selection of accuracy requirements, called accuracy-based curriculum learning. Using a reinforcement learning agent based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm and addressing the Reacher environment, we first show that an agent trained with various accuracy requirements sampled randomly learns more efficiently than when asked to be very accurate at all times. Then we show that adaptive selection of accuracy requirements, based on a local measure of competence progress, automatically generates a curriculum where difficulty progressively increases, resulting in a better learning efficiency than sampling randomly.",0
"In our work we propose a new algorithm for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that leverages the accuracy of model predictions at each time step as a curriculum, guiding the agent towards better exploration strategies. Our method differs from traditional DRL algorithms such as Q-learning and actor critic methods which use randomness, epsilon-greedy policies or Boltzmann distributions to control exploration in the face of uncertainty. Instead, by using the predictive power of models as a proxy measure of their trustworthiness, we show that agents can learn faster, perform more efficiently and converge to higher quality solutions on challenging tasks. We provide experimental evidence that supports these claims across three different domains - continuous control, discrete action selection and competitive multiplayer games. Finally, our findings open up promising directions for future research into understanding how to design effective exploration mechanisms that bridge the gap between theory and practice in artificial intelligence.",1
"We consider the problem of reinforcement learning under safety requirements, in which an agent is trained to complete a given task, typically formalized as the maximization of a reward signal over time, while concurrently avoiding undesirable actions or states, associated to lower rewards, or penalties. The construction and balancing of different reward components can be difficult in the presence of multiple objectives, yet is crucial for producing a satisfying policy. For example, in reaching a target while avoiding obstacles, low collision penalties can lead to reckless movements while high penalties can discourage exploration. To circumvent this limitation, we examine the effect of past actions in terms of safety to estimate which are acceptable or should be avoided in the future. We then actively reshape the action space of the agent during reinforcement learning, so that reward-driven exploration is constrained within safety limits. We propose an algorithm enabling the learning of such safety constraints in parallel with reinforcement learning and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of both task completion and training time.",0
"Incorporating user preference into decision making processes has been shown to increase satisfaction and compliance. However, finding out user preferences often requires multiple trials. This study explores how using a combination of user feedback and constraint optimization can reduce the number of trials necessary while still incorporating user preference. Results show that users preferred the experience shaped system compared to standard systems across all tasks except one where constraints were very strict. Imposing even simple constraints increased the likelihood of recovery by nearly three times compared to no constraints. These findings have important implications for automation design and human interaction as they demonstrate that balancing automation autonomy and user control is possible through constrained exploration and recovery methods. The method presented here may facilitate more successful interactions between humans and automation while increasing overall efficiency.",1
"In reinforcement learning (RL) , one of the key components is policy evaluation, which aims to estimate the value function (i.e., expected long-term accumulated reward) of a policy. With a good policy evaluation method, the RL algorithms will estimate the value function more accurately and find a better policy. When the state space is large or continuous \emph{Gradient-based Temporal Difference(GTD)} policy evaluation algorithms with linear function approximation are widely used. Considering that the collection of the evaluation data is both time and reward consuming, a clear understanding of the finite sample performance of the policy evaluation algorithms is very important to reinforcement learning. Under the assumption that data are i.i.d. generated, previous work provided the finite sample analysis of the GTD algorithms with constant step size by converting them into convex-concave saddle point problems. However, it is well-known that, the data are generated from Markov processes rather than i.i.d. in RL problems.. In this paper, in the realistic Markov setting, we derive the finite sample bounds for the general convex-concave saddle point problems, and hence for the GTD algorithms. We have the following discussions based on our bounds. (1) With variants of step size, GTD algorithms converge. (2) The convergence rate is determined by the step size, with the mixing time of the Markov process as the coefficient. The faster the Markov processes mix, the faster the convergence. (3) We explain that the experience replay trick is effective by improving the mixing property of the Markov process. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to provide finite sample bounds for the GTD algorithms in Markov setting.",0
"Here we consider the problem of policy evaluation using the state value iteration method and apply these algorithms to evaluate policies associated with infinite horizon discounted reward and average cost objectives. We show that given sufficient sample sizes of both finite sample estimates and Monte Carlo rollouts from initial states, the estimated values converge linearly as functions of time elapsed since training data generation. If these assumptions do not hold, then we can still obtain meaningful results by taking appropriate combinations of truncations from unrolling trajectories, but this requires larger samples. Furthermore, when the dynamics parameters have measurement error, the optimal choice of how many observations go into each estimate depends on whether one cares primarily about accuracy at short times versus long times following the last updated parameter estimate. As far as numerical performance goes, the proposed procedures perform well despite suffering from potentially slow convergence in the limit of small or no sample truncation; they remain competitive even against alternatives whose development presumes knowledge of some upper bound on transition probabilities away from the current estimate of stationary distribution under the behavioral policy. Moreover, these benefits come without having to store and backpropagate every possible pairwise combination of transitions across all state-action pairs; only keeping track of fixed sets suffices.",1
"Q-learning is one of the most popular methods in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Transfer Learning aims to utilize the learned knowledge from source tasks to help new tasks to improve the sample complexity of the new tasks. Considering that data collection in RL is both more time and cost consuming and Q-learning converges slowly comparing to supervised learning, different kinds of transfer RL algorithms are designed. However, most of them are heuristic with no theoretical guarantee of the convergence rate. Therefore, it is important for us to clearly understand when and how will transfer learning help RL method and provide the theoretical guarantee for the improvement of the sample complexity. In this paper, we propose to transfer the Q-function learned in the source task to the target of the Q-learning in the new task when certain safe conditions are satisfied. We call this new transfer Q-learning method target transfer Q-Learning. The safe conditions are necessary to avoid the harm to the new tasks and thus ensure the convergence of the algorithm. We study the convergence rate of the target transfer Q-learning. We prove that if the two tasks are similar with respect to the MDPs, the optimal Q-functions in the source and new RL tasks are similar which means the error of the transferred target Q-function in new MDP is small. Also, the convergence rate analysis shows that the target transfer Q-Learning will converge faster than Q-learning if the error of the transferred target Q-function is smaller than the current Q-function in the new task. Based on our theoretical results, we design the safe condition as the Bellman error of the transferred target Q-function is less than the current Q-function. Our experiments are consistent with our theoretical founding and verified the effectiveness of our proposed target transfer Q-learning method.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm based on the popular deep reinforcement learning algorithm called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Specifically, our proposed method integrates a target network into DDPG which improves sample efficiency by reducing Q value overestimation during training. We use theoretical analysis supported by simulations to demonstrate that target transfer can achieve faster convergence compared to standard experience replay with linear increase buffer size. Our results indicate that our modified model has lower Q values and better policy stability than other baseline algorithms like SARSA(0) and actor critic models trained under similar conditions. Furthermore, we show that training performance improves as temperature increases and propose a novel algorithm for adjusting temperature values throughout training using a fixed schedule rather than adaptive methods. Finally, we present experimental evidence from challenging control tasks to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our study extends current understanding of how target networks operate within the context of RL algorithms and provides insights towards efficient use of computational resources.",1
"Through many recent successes in simulation, model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to solving continuous control robotic tasks. The research community is now able to reproduce, analyze and build quickly on these results due to open source implementations of learning algorithms and simulated benchmark tasks. To carry forward these successes to real-world applications, it is crucial to withhold utilizing the unique advantages of simulations that do not transfer to the real world and experiment directly with physical robots. However, reinforcement learning research with physical robots faces substantial resistance due to the lack of benchmark tasks and supporting source code. In this work, we introduce several reinforcement learning tasks with multiple commercially available robots that present varying levels of learning difficulty, setup, and repeatability. On these tasks, we test the learning performance of off-the-shelf implementations of four reinforcement learning algorithms and analyze sensitivity to their hyper-parameters to determine their readiness for applications in various real-world tasks. Our results show that with a careful setup of the task interface and computations, some of these implementations can be readily applicable to physical robots. We find that state-of-the-art learning algorithms are highly sensitive to their hyper-parameters and their relative ordering does not transfer across tasks, indicating the necessity of re-tuning them for each task for best performance. On the other hand, the best hyper-parameter configuration from one task may often result in effective learning on held-out tasks even with different robots, providing a reasonable default. We make the benchmark tasks publicly available to enhance reproducibility in real-world reinforcement learning.",0
"This research focuses on benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms on real-world robots to evaluate their performance and identify strengths and weaknesses.

The results demonstrate that each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the complexity of the task, the amount of data available, and the type of robot used. By providing a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on real robots, this study aims to assist researchers in selecting appropriate algorithms for their specific applications and identifying promising directions for future work. Overall, this paper contributes to the field by establishing a baseline for evaluating RL algorithms on real robots and facilitating progress towards achieving advanced autonomy in complex and dynamic environments.",1
"In continuous action domains, standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms like DDPG suffer from inefficient exploration when facing sparse or deceptive reward problems. Conversely, evolutionary and developmental methods focusing on exploration like Novelty Search, Quality-Diversity or Goal Exploration Processes explore more robustly but are less efficient at fine-tuning policies using gradient descent. In this paper, we present the GEP-PG approach, taking the best of both worlds by sequentially combining a Goal Exploration Process and two variants of DDPG. We study the learning performance of these components and their combination on a low dimensional deceptive reward problem and on the larger Half-Cheetah benchmark. We show that DDPG fails on the former and that GEP-PG improves over the best DDPG variant in both environments.

"Title: Optimizing Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Performance through Decoupled Exploration and Exploitation  Optimization in deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been limited by the tradeoff between exploring new solutions and exploiting already known ones. This tradeoff has hindered the performance of RL algorithms in finding optimal solutions. In this study, we propose a novel approach called GEP-PG that decouples exploration from exploitation in deep RL algorithms, allowing for more effective optimization. Our method utilizes genetic evaluation programming (GEP), which is guided by problem-specific heuristics to improve the quality of search. We combine this with policy gradient methods to efficiently update policies, resulting in a highly optimized algorithm.  Experiments conducted on benchmark domains show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms across all domains tested. Our results demonstrate the potential of decoupled exploration and exploitation techniques for improving the performance of deep RL algorithms. With further development, these approaches could lead to breakthroughs in solving complex real-world problems that have previously eluded automation due to limitations in traditional optimization techniques. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward in optimizing the performance of deep RL algorithms and paves the way for future research into enhancing their applicability beyond simulated environments.",1
"Multiple-step lookahead policies have demonstrated high empirical competence in Reinforcement Learning, via the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search or Model Predictive Control. In a recent work \cite{efroni2018beyond}, multiple-step greedy policies and their use in vanilla Policy Iteration algorithms were proposed and analyzed. In this work, we study multiple-step greedy algorithms in more practical setups. We begin by highlighting a counter-intuitive difficulty, arising with soft-policy updates: even in the absence of approximations, and contrary to the 1-step-greedy case, monotonic policy improvement is not guaranteed unless the update stepsize is sufficiently large. Taking particular care about this difficulty, we formulate and analyze online and approximate algorithms that use such a multi-step greedy operator.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing algorithms that can learn from experience, known as reinforcement learning (RL). One key challenge faced by RL agents is choosing actions that lead to high rewards over multiple time steps. While there have been several approaches developed to address this issue, many suffer from computational complexity or require strong assumptions about the environment. In our work, we propose the use of multiple-step greedy policies, which allow agents to make decisions based on potential future rewards rather than just immediate gratification. We show through experimental evaluation that these policies can outperform state-of-the-art methods across a range of domains, including both online learning settings where interactions occur sequentially and approximate settings where estimates of values must be computed efficiently. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using multi-step reasoning in RL, even without perfect knowledge of the environment, opening up new possibilities for solving complex real-world problems with intelligent agents.",1
"Temporal difference (TD) learning is an important approach in reinforcement learning, as it combines ideas from dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods in a way that allows for online and incremental model-free learning. A key idea of TD learning is that it is learning predictive knowledge about the environment in the form of value functions, from which it can derive its behavior to address long-term sequential decision making problems. The agent's horizon of interest, that is, how immediate or long-term a TD learning agent predicts into the future, is adjusted through a discount rate parameter. In this paper, we introduce an alternative view on the discount rate, with insight from digital signal processing, to include complex-valued discounting. Our results show that setting the discount rate to appropriately chosen complex numbers allows for online and incremental estimation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal of interest with TD learning. We thereby extend the types of knowledge representable by value functions, which we show are particularly useful for identifying periodic effects in the reward sequence.",0

"The score function estimator is widely used for estimating gradients of stochastic objectives in stochastic computation graphs (SCG), eg, in reinforcement learning and meta-learning. While deriving the first-order gradient estimators by differentiating a surrogate loss (SL) objective is computationally and conceptually simple, using the same approach for higher-order derivatives is more challenging. Firstly, analytically deriving and implementing such estimators is laborious and not compliant with automatic differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL to construct new objectives for each order derivative involves increasingly cumbersome graph manipulations. Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under differentiation, SL treats part of the cost as a fixed sample, which we show leads to missing and wrong terms for estimators of higher-order derivatives. To address all these shortcomings in a unified way, we introduce DiCE, which provides a single objective that can be differentiated repeatedly, generating correct estimators of derivatives of any order in SCGs. Unlike SL, DiCE relies on automatic differentiation for performing the requisite graph manipulations. We verify the correctness of DiCE both through a proof and numerical evaluation of the DiCE derivative estimates. We also use DiCE to propose and evaluate a novel approach for multi-agent learning.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years thanks to advancements in machine learning algorithms that allow systems to learn from data.

"We explore the problem of learning to decompose spatial tasks into segments, as exemplified by the problem of a painting robot covering a large object. Inspired by the ability of classical decision tree algorithms to construct structured partitions of their input spaces, we formulate the problem of decomposing objects into segments as a parsing approach. We make the insight that the derivation of a parse-tree that decomposes the object into segments closely resembles a decision tree constructed by ID3, which can be done when the ground-truth available. We learn to imitate an expert parsing oracle, such that our neural parser can generalize to parse natural images without ground truth. We introduce a novel deterministic policy gradient update, DRAG (i.e., DeteRministically AGgrevate) in the form of a deterministic actor-critic variant of AggreVaTeD, to train our neural parser. From another perspective, our approach is a variant of the Deterministic Policy Gradient suitable for the imitation learning setting. The deterministic policy representation offered by training our neural parser with DRAG allows it to outperform state of the art imitation and reinforcement learning approaches.",0
"Developing natural language processing (NLP) models that can accurately parse sentences into meaning representations has been a significant challenge due to the lack of annotated data and intricacies involved in understanding contextual dependencies. In recent years, researchers have explored using deep learning methods to solve parsing problems by training neural network architectures on large datasets. However, these approaches often struggle to achieve state-of-the-art results as they rely solely on trial-and-error optimization techniques rather than guiding principles from linguistics theory. This paper presents a novel approach called deterministic differentiable imitation learning that addresses these issues by bridging the gap between NLP theories and machine learning practices. We show that our method outperforms baseline models trained on pure supervision and leads to more interpretable parses by capturing hierarchical structures present in human-like parses. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential benefits of pretraining on unlabeled corpora using weak heuristics derived from linguistic analysis which further improves performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Overall, this work paves the way for future advancements in NLP towards making intelligent agents capable of advanced text comprehension tasks such as question answering and generation.",1
"We present an effective technique for training deep learning agents capable of negotiating on a set of clauses in a contract agreement using a simple communication protocol. We use Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning to train both agents simultaneously as they negotiate with each other in the training environment. We also model selfish and prosocial behavior to varying degrees in these agents. Empirical evidence is provided showing consistency in agent behaviors. We further train a meta agent with a mixture of behaviors by learning an ensemble of different models using reinforcement learning. Finally, to ascertain the deployability of the negotiating agents, we conducted experiments pitting the trained agents against human players. Results demonstrate that the agents are able to hold their own against human players, often emerging as winners in the negotiation. Our experiments demonstrate that the meta agent is able to reasonably emulate human behavior.",0
"""This paper investigates how agent behavior can impact contract negotiation outcomes when using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. We explore two distinct types of agents: prosocial, who prioritize the needs of others in their decision making, and selfish, who act primarily in their own interests. Our research examines whether one approach consistently leads to better results than the other in negotiating favorable deals. In our experiments, we find that both strategies can produce successful outcomes but under certain conditions, prosocial behavior may lead to more beneficial agreements. This suggests there could be situations where considering the interest of others during negotiations could result in greater success.""",1
"We propose to use boosted regression trees as a way to compute human-interpretable solutions to reinforcement learning problems. Boosting combines several regression trees to improve their accuracy without significantly reducing their inherent interpretability. Prior work has focused independently on reinforcement learning and on interpretable machine learning, but there has been little progress in interpretable reinforcement learning. Our experimental results show that boosted regression trees compute solutions that are both interpretable and match the quality of leading reinforcement learning methods.",0
"Interpreting reinforcement learning models can be challenging due to their complex nature and reliance on deep neural networks that are difficult to interpret.

Our approach allows us to trade off some of the optimality of the learned policy with increased transparency and interpretability. In addition, we provide experimental results showing improved human comprehensibility over single RL policies and state-of-the-art baselines like GAIL. Finally, we discuss potential use cases where our method could have significant impact such as healthcare applications where explainability of decision making processes is crucial.",1
"The main focus of this paper is on enhancement of two types of game-theoretic learning algorithms: log-linear learning and reinforcement learning. The standard analysis of log-linear learning needs a highly structured environment, i.e. strong assumptions about the game from an implementation perspective. In this paper, we introduce a variant of log-linear learning that provides asymptotic guarantees while relaxing the structural assumptions to include synchronous updates and limitations in information available to the players. On the other hand, model-free reinforcement learning is able to perform even under weaker assumptions on players' knowledge about the environment and other players' strategies. We propose a reinforcement algorithm that uses a double-aggregation scheme in order to deepen players' insight about the environment and constant learning step-size which achieves a higher convergence rate.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced significantly over recent years, leading to many exciting breakthroughs across various domains. In particular, multi-agent systems have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and robotics. This study aimed to develop new methods that could enable more effective learning and decision making in these complex environments.  The authors began by considering game-theoretic models of multi-agent interaction. They explored how agents can reason about others’ behaviors using log linear models and developed algorithms based on reinforcement learning principles. These algorithms were designed to optimize strategies and outcomes in scenarios where multiple agents make decisions simultaneously.  To evaluate their approach, the researchers conducted experiments with simulated autonomous car interactions and a social dilemma scenario involving energy consumption reduction. Results showed that the proposed method effectively balanced individual selfishness and cooperation among agents, promoting better overall outcomes compared to traditional approaches.  In summary, the work presents a significant contribution towards improving the performance of artificial agents in real-world settings.

Overall, this study paves the way for future advancements in multi-agent systems and provides valuable insights into developing intelligent agents capable of making ethical, sustainable choices.",1
"Many reinforcement-learning researchers treat the reward function as a part of the environment, meaning that the agent can only know the reward of a state if it encounters that state in a trial run. However, we argue that this is an unnecessary limitation and instead, the reward function should be provided to the learning algorithm. The advantage is that the algorithm can then use the reward function to check the reward for states that the agent hasn't even encountered yet. In addition, the algorithm can simultaneously learn policies for multiple reward functions. For each state, the algorithm would calculate the reward using each of the reward functions and add the rewards to its experience replay dataset. The Hindsight Experience Replay algorithm developed by Andrychowicz et al. (2017) does just this, and learns to generalize across a distribution of sparse, goal-based rewards. We extend this algorithm to linearly-weighted, multi-objective rewards and learn a single policy that can generalize across all linear combinations of the multi-objective reward. Whereas other multi-objective algorithms teach the Q-function to generalize across the reward weights, our algorithm enables the policy to generalize, and can thus be used with continuous actions.",0
"This research explores a new method for deep reinforcement learning that enables agents to generalize across multiple objectives within reward functions. We propose a novel approach called Multi-objective Generalized Policy Search (MOGPS), which combines the strengths of multi-objective policy search algorithms and generalized policy improvement methods. Our algorithm can effectively learn policies that perform well under each objective separately while ensuring good performance on the combined objective as well. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate MOGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three challenging environments, including Mujoco locomotion tasks, the Atari Pong game, and MuJoCo control problems. These results indicate the promise of our approach for more robust and flexible decision making in real-world applications where achieving multiple goals may be critical.",1
"Learning robot tasks or controllers using deep reinforcement learning has been proven effective in simulations. Learning in simulation has several advantages. For example, one can fully control the simulated environment, including halting motions while performing computations. Another advantage when robots are involved, is that the amount of time a robot is occupied learning a task---rather than being productive---can be reduced by transferring the learned task to the real robot. Transfer learning requires some amount of fine-tuning on the real robot. For tasks which involve complex (non-linear) dynamics, the fine-tuning itself may take a substantial amount of time. In order to reduce the amount of fine-tuning we propose to learn robustified controllers in simulation. Robustified controllers are learned by exploiting the ability to change simulation parameters (both appearance and dynamics) for successive training episodes. An additional benefit for this approach is that it alleviates the precise determination of physics parameters for the simulator, which is a non-trivial task. We demonstrate our proposed approach on a real setup in which a robot aims to solve a maze game, which involves complex dynamics due to static friction and potentially large accelerations. We show that the amount of fine-tuning in transfer learning for a robustified controller is substantially reduced compared to a non-robustified controller.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for transferring learning from simulation to real world robotic tasks that involve complex dynamics. We propose utilizing robustified controllers to increase the reliability and efficiency of the task completion process. Our approach involves fine-tuning models trained in simulation using a combination of visual servoing and model predictive control techniques. Experimental results on several robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant improvements over traditional simulation-to-real transfer approaches. Overall, we show that using robustified controllers can lead to more accurate and reliable performance in challenging robotic tasks involving complex dynamics.",1
"Dynamic treatment recommendation systems based on large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) become a key to successfully improve practical clinical outcomes. Prior relevant studies recommend treatments either use supervised learning (e.g. matching the indicator signal which denotes doctor prescriptions), or reinforcement learning (e.g. maximizing evaluation signal which indicates cumulative reward from survival rates). However, none of these studies have considered to combine the benefits of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network (SRL-RNN), which fuses them into a synergistic learning framework. Specifically, SRL-RNN applies an off-policy actor-critic framework to handle complex relations among multiple medications, diseases and individual characteristics. The ""actor"" in the framework is adjusted by both the indicator signal and evaluation signal to ensure effective prescription and low mortality. RNN is further utilized to solve the Partially-Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem due to the lack of fully observed states in real world applications. Experiments on the publicly real-world dataset, i.e., MIMIC-3, illustrate that our model can reduce the estimated mortality, while providing promising accuracy in matching doctors' prescriptions.",0
"Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised reinforcement learning framework based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) for dynamic treatment recommendation. With limited prior knowledge regarding each patient’s outcome under different treatments, we aim to use medical data from both treated patients and healthy control groups to train our model so that it can accurately predict optimal treatment paths by considering sequential interactions among multiple variables, including clinical measurements, demographic characteristics, and genetic markers. Our approach adopts a state-action value decomposition algorithm, named QLV-learning, which iteratively estimates joint action values with lower variance while updating policies efficiently using backpropagation through time. By testing on simulated datasets generated from real hospital records, our results show consistent improvement over traditional rule-based treatment guidelines and existing machine learning methods that disregard temporal dependencies. Additionally, we demonstrate our method’s applicability to other domains with nonlinear dynamics where actions affect states. In summary, our work presents a novel solution towards personalized medicine, one of today’s most exciting breakthrough opportunities at the intersection of computer science, statistics, biology, engineering, mathematics, physics, sociology, economics, psychology, policy analysis and ethics.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has become popular over recent years, showing superiority on different visual-input tasks such as playing Atari games and robot navigation.

"Autonomous AI systems will be entering human society in the near future to provide services and work alongside humans. For those systems to be accepted and trusted, the users should be able to understand the reasoning process of the system, i.e. the system should be transparent. System transparency enables humans to form coherent explanations of the system's decisions and actions. Transparency is important not only for user trust, but also for software debugging and certification. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks have made great advances in multiple application areas. However, deep neural networks are opaque. In this paper, we report on work in transparency in Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks (DRLN). Such networks have been extremely successful in accurately learning action control in image input domains, such as Atari games. In this paper, we propose a novel and general method that (a) incorporates explicit object recognition processing into deep reinforcement learning models, (b) forms the basis for the development of ""object saliency maps"", to provide visualization of internal states of DRLNs, thus enabling the formation of explanations and (c) can be incorporated in any existing deep reinforcement learning framework. We present computational results and human experiments to evaluate our approach.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have become increasingly important in our daily lives, making decisions that can greatly impact individuals and society as a whole. One area where these decisions can have significant consequences is in deep reinforcement learning neural networks. As these networks continue to gain popularity, there has been growing concern over their lack of transparency and difficulty explaining why certain decisions were made. This study seeks to address this issue by exploring how transparency and explanation methods can be integrated into deep reinforcement learning neural networks. By doing so, we aim to increase trust in these decision-making processes while ensuring accountability. Throughout this research, we examine several case studies to illustrate how transparency and explanations can improve understanding and confidence in the decisions of deep reinforcement learning neural networks. Ultimately, this work contributes towards advancing responsible and ethical use of AI technologies in society.",1
"Current imitation learning techniques are too restrictive because they require the agent and expert to share the same action space. However, oftentimes agents that act differently from the expert can solve the task just as good. For example, a person lifting a box can be imitated by a ceiling mounted robot or a desktop-based robotic-arm. In both cases, the end goal of lifting the box is achieved, perhaps using different strategies. We denote this setup as \textit{Inspiration Learning} - knowledge transfer between agents that operate in different action spaces. Since state-action expert demonstrations can no longer be used, Inspiration learning requires novel methods to guide the agent towards the end goal. In this work, we rely on ideas of Preferential based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) to design Advantage Actor-Critic algorithms for solving inspiration learning tasks. Unlike classic actor-critic architectures, the critic we use consists of two parts: a) a state-value estimation as in common actor-critic algorithms and b) a single step reward function derived from an expert/agent classifier. We show that our method is capable of extending the current imitation framework to new horizons. This includes continuous-to-discrete action imitation, as well as primitive-to-macro action imitation.",0

"Complex autonomous control systems are subjected to sensor failures, cyber-attacks, sensor noise, communication channel failures, etc. that introduce errors in the measurements. The corrupted information, if used for making decisions, can lead to degraded performance. We develop a framework for using adversarial deep reinforcement learning to design observer strategies that are robust to adversarial errors in information channels. We further show through simulation studies that the learned observation strategies perform remarkably well when the adversary's injected errors are bounded in some sense. We use neural network as function approximator in our studies with the understanding that any other suitable function approximating class can be used within our framework.",0

"A probability density function (pdf) encodes the entire stochastic knowledge about data distribution, where data may represent stochastic observations in robotics, transition state pairs in reinforcement learning or any other empirically acquired modality. Inferring data pdf is of prime importance, allowing to analyze various model hypotheses and perform smart decision making. However, most density estimation techniques are limited in their representation expressiveness to specific kernel type or predetermined distribution family, and have other restrictions. For example, kernel density estimation (KDE) methods require meticulous parameter search and are extremely slow at querying new points. In this paper we present a novel non-parametric density estimation approach, DeepPDF, that uses a neural network to approximate a target pdf given samples from thereof. Such a representation provides high inference accuracy for a wide range of target pdfs using a relatively simple network structure, making our method highly statistically robust. This is done via a new stochastic optimization algorithm, \emph{Probabilistic Surface Optimization} (PSO), that turns to advantage the stochastic nature of sample points in order to force network output to be identical to the output of a target pdf. Once trained, query point evaluation can be efficiently done in DeepPDF by a simple network forward pass, with linear complexity in the number of query points. Moreover, the PSO algorithm is capable of inferring the frequency of data samples and may also be used in other statistical tasks such as conditional estimation and distribution transformation. We compare the derived approach with KDE methods showing its superior performance and accuracy.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using machine learning techniques to analyze and optimize physical systems. One important area where these methods have proven useful is in the optimization of surfaces and their associated parameters, such as shape and texture. However, existing approaches often struggle with issues related to noise sensitivity and computational efficiency, particularly when working with large datasets. This work proposes a new method for probabilistic surface optimization that addresses these challenges through the use of density estimation and Bayesian inference. We demonstrate how our approach can effectively learn from data and accurately estimate unknowns, while remaining computationally efficient even for very large datasets. Our results show significant improvements over previous methods on both synthetic and real-world examples, making deep PDF a promising tool for a variety of applications including computer graphics and scientific simulations.",1
"Reinforcement Learning methods are capable of solving complex problems, but resulting policies might perform poorly in environments that are even slightly different. In robotics especially, training and deployment conditions often vary and data collection is expensive, making retraining undesirable. Simulation training allows for feasible training times, but on the other hand suffers from a reality-gap when applied in real-world settings. This raises the need of efficient adaptation of policies acting in new environments. We consider this as a problem of transferring knowledge within a family of similar Markov decision processes.   For this purpose we assume that Q-functions are generated by some low-dimensional latent variable. Given such a Q-function, we can find a master policy that can adapt given different values of this latent variable. Our method learns both the generative mapping and an approximate posterior of the latent variables, enabling identification of policies for new tasks by searching only in the latent space, rather than the space of all policies. The low-dimensional space, and master policy found by our method enables policies to quickly adapt to new environments. We demonstrate the method on both a pendulum swing-up task in simulation, and for simulation-to-real transfer on a pushing task.",0
"In recent years transfer learning has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to solving real world reinforcement learning problems. By leveraging knowledge acquired from related tasks, agents can learn faster and achieve better performance on new tasks.

We evaluate our approach using several benchmark domains with up to ten related tasks, showing improvements over strong baselines across all experiments. Our findings suggest that the proposed framework achieves efficient policy transfer even for dissimilar settings while allowing effective generalization to unseen environments. Finally, we provide detailed analyses including ablations which justify design choices made and demonstrate the validity of our claims.",1
"Early detection of cyber-attacks is crucial for a safe and reliable operation of the smart grid. In the literature, outlier detection schemes making sample-by-sample decisions and online detection schemes requiring perfect attack models have been proposed. In this paper, we formulate the online attack/anomaly detection problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problem and propose a universal robust online detection algorithm using the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) for POMDPs. Numerical studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed RL-based algorithm in timely and accurate detection of cyber-attacks targeting the smart grid.",0

Experimental results show that our system outperforms baseline approaches both in terms of attack detection effectiveness and energy consumption efficiency. We conclude by discussing future directions and potential applications of our research.

"Model-based reinforcement learning approaches carry the promise of being data efficient. However, due to challenges in learning dynamics models that sufficiently match the real-world dynamics, they struggle to achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free methods. We propose Model-Based Meta-Policy-Optimization (MB-MPO), an approach that foregoes the strong reliance on accurate learned dynamics models. Using an ensemble of learned dynamic models, MB-MPO meta-learns a policy that can quickly adapt to any model in the ensemble with one policy gradient step. This steers the meta-policy towards internalizing consistent dynamics predictions among the ensemble while shifting the burden of behaving optimally w.r.t. the model discrepancies towards the adaptation step. Our experiments show that MB-MPO is more robust to model imperfections than previous model-based approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is able to match the asymptotic performance of model-free methods while requiring significantly less experience.",0
In this paper we propose an algorithm called Model-based Reinforcement Learning via Meta-policy optimization (MBRL) which combines model-free reinforcement learning methods with planning. Our approach uses temporal difference learning with a bootstrapped estimate to learn a state value function approximator that is used by a meta-controller agent to select actions from a policy library. We demonstrate our method on several continuous control benchmark tasks where we observe better performance compared to baseline algorithms. The contribution of this work lies in extending the use case for deep RL into domains involving high complexity models and continuous action spaces while maintaining good sample efficiency and robustness properties. By doing so we bridge a gap between model based RL approaches traditionally favored in these settings but hindered by large compute costs and sample insensitive DNNs and data efficient model free RL methods more commonly applied to Atari games and other low dimensional control problems. Additional details about our algorithm as well as empirical results can be found within the paper.,1
"Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches have demonstrated advanced performance in image captioning by directly optimizing the metric used for testing. However, this shaped reward introduces learning biases, which reduces the readability of generated text. In addition, the large sample space makes training unstable and slow. To alleviate these issues, we propose a simple coherent solution that constrains the action space using an n-gram language prior. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmarks show that RL with the simple add-on module performs favorably against its counterpart in terms of both readability and speed of convergence. Human evaluation results show that our model is more human readable and graceful. The implementation will become publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.",0
"Recent advances in computer vision have led to significant improvements in image captioning, a task that involves generating natural language descriptions of images. One popular approach to image captioning is through reinforcement learning (RL), which involves training agents to select sequences of words that maximize a reward signal based on their relevance to the input image. However, RL can suffer from slow convergence and instability due to the high-dimensionality of the state space, as well as difficulties in exploration and exploitation of the environment. To address these issues, we propose using natural language prior knowledge, such as pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT-2, to guide the agent’s selection of actions. Our experimental results show that incorporating natural language priors leads to more accurate and coherent descriptions of the underlying images compared to baseline approaches without prior knowledge. In addition, we demonstrate the transferability of our trained model across different datasets, showing its versatility and effectiveness in improving RL-based image captioning systems. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on using artificial intelligence to enhance human communication and expression through image description tasks.",1
"Achieving machine intelligence requires a smooth integration of perception and reasoning, yet models developed to date tend to specialize in one or the other; sophisticated manipulation of symbols acquired from rich perceptual spaces has so far proved elusive. Consider a visual arithmetic task, where the goal is to carry out simple arithmetical algorithms on digits presented under natural conditions (e.g. hand-written, placed randomly). We propose a two-tiered architecture for tackling this problem. The lower tier consists of a heterogeneous collection of information processing modules, which can include pre-trained deep neural networks for locating and extracting characters from the image, as well as modules performing symbolic transformations on the representations extracted by perception. The higher tier consists of a controller, trained using reinforcement learning, which coordinates the modules in order to solve the high-level task. For instance, the controller may learn in what contexts to execute the perceptual networks and what symbolic transformations to apply to their outputs. The resulting model is able to solve a variety of tasks in the visual arithmetic domain, and has several advantages over standard, architecturally homogeneous feedforward networks including improved sample efficiency.",0

Sequential coordination refers to a problem where multiple deep models need to learn together to solve complex tasks that are difficult or impossible for any one model alone to solve. In this work, we focus on a particular instance of sequential coordination: learning visual arithmetic problems, where a sequence of reasoning steps must be applied to images to yield correct results. We present two approaches based on existing state-of-the-art methods and evaluate them using human studies, finding our best method achieves near-human accuracy and greatly outperforms baseline models without sequential coordination. These promising results suggest new opportunities for applying sequential coordination in future research areas involving complex visuospatial reasoning.",1
"Recently it has shown that the policy-gradient methods for reinforcement learning have been utilized to train deep end-to-end systems on natural language processing tasks.

"The reinforcement learning community has made great strides in designing algorithms capable of exceeding human performance on specific tasks. These algorithms are mostly trained one task at the time, each new task requiring to train a brand new agent instance. This means the learning algorithm is general, but each solution is not; each agent can only solve the one task it was trained on. In this work, we study the problem of learning to master not one but multiple sequential-decision tasks at once. A general issue in multi-task learning is that a balance must be found between the needs of multiple tasks competing for the limited resources of a single learning system. Many learning algorithms can get distracted by certain tasks in the set of tasks to solve. Such tasks appear more salient to the learning process, for instance because of the density or magnitude of the in-task rewards. This causes the algorithm to focus on those salient tasks at the expense of generality. We propose to automatically adapt the contribution of each task to the agent's updates, so that all tasks have a similar impact on the learning dynamics. This resulted in state of the art performance on learning to play all games in a set of 57 diverse Atari games. Excitingly, our method learned a single trained policy - with a single set of weights - that exceeds median human performance. To our knowledge, this was the first time a single agent surpassed human-level performance on this multi-task domain. The same approach also demonstrated state of the art performance on a set of 30 tasks in the 3D reinforcement learning platform DeepMind Lab.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex sequential decision making problems. However, most DRL algorithms suffer from the problem of high sample complexity, which means they require large amounts of data and computational resources to learn good policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-task deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the popular neural network architecture called PopArt. Our algorithm exploits the similarity among different tasks by sharing some layers of the neural network across them while still maintaining task specific representations. We show through extensive experiments on various benchmark domains that our approach achieves better performance compared to standard single-task DRL methods while requiring significantly fewer samples and computational resources. Additionally, we analyze the effectiveness of the shared representation and discuss the impact of different hyperparameters on the overall performance.

"Title: ""Learning to Drive in a Day""  Abstract: Many drivers spend months or even years learning how to drive safely on their own, but what if you could learn everything you need to know in just one day? With dedication, focus, and the right teaching methods, anyone can become proficient at driving quickly and confidently behind the wheel. Our study sought to test whether crash-course style driver education programs were effective compared to traditional multi-month programs. We recruited novice drivers aged 21-49 without any prior driving experience and randomly assigned them into two groups – those who received our intensive “Learn to Drive in a Day” course, and another group enrolled in a standard three-month program. Both groups completed a pretest, posttest, and six month follow-up assessment that evaluated their knowledge of traffic rules and regulations, hazard perception skills, driving attitudes, and reported confidence levels. Results showed no significant differences between groups’ knowledge retention rates over time, indicating that both approaches had equal effectiveness. However, participants rated the Learn to Drive in a Day course as more enjoyable overall, with higher scores for convenience and satisfaction. These findings suggest that, given similar resources and instructor qualifications, abbreviated programs may offer more efficient and appealing alternatives to conventional driver education courses.",1
"Real-time advertising allows advertisers to bid for each impression for a visiting user. To optimize specific goals such as maximizing revenue and return on investment (ROI) led by ad placements, advertisers not only need to estimate the relevance between the ads and user's interests, but most importantly require a strategic response with respect to other advertisers bidding in the market. In this paper, we formulate bidding optimization with multi-agent reinforcement learning. To deal with a large number of advertisers, we propose a clustering method and assign each cluster with a strategic bidding agent. A practical Distributed Coordinated Multi-Agent Bidding (DCMAB) has been proposed and implemented to balance the tradeoff between the competition and cooperation among advertisers. The empirical study on our industry-scaled real-world data has demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods. Our results show cluster-based bidding would largely outperform single-agent and bandit approaches, and the coordinated bidding achieves better overall objectives than purely self-interested bidding agents.",0
"Online display advertising has become increasingly complex as advertisers compete for consumer attention on multiple platforms across devices. Real-time bidding (RTB) allows advertisers to bid on individual impressions based on their predicted value in real time. However, traditional RTB systems use simple heuristics that fail to capture the nuances of the modern advertising landscape. In this paper, we propose using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to improve performance in display advertising auctions. Our approach leverages deep neural networks to estimate the expected revenue from each impression for each agent, allowing them to make more accurate bids. We evaluate our approach through simulations and find that MARL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, resulting in higher average revenues per campaign and increased efficiency in terms of cost and ad viewability. These results demonstrate the potential of MARL to transform online display advertising and provide new insights into how artificial intelligence can enhance decision making in complex environments.",1
"Making the right decision in traffic is a challenging task that is highly dependent on individual preferences as well as the surrounding environment. Therefore it is hard to model solely based on expert knowledge. In this work we use Deep Reinforcement Learning to learn maneuver decisions based on a compact semantic state representation. This ensures a consistent model of the environment across scenarios as well as a behavior adaptation function, enabling on-line changes of desired behaviors without re-training. The input for the neural network is a simulated object list similar to that of Radar or Lidar sensors, superimposed by a relational semantic scene description. The state as well as the reward are extended by a behavior adaptation function and a parameterization respectively. With little expert knowledge and a set of mid-level actions, it can be seen that the agent is capable to adhere to traffic rules and learns to drive safely in a variety of situations.",0

"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are on the road. To safely and efficiently interact with other road participants, AVs have to accurately predict the behavior of surrounding vehicles and plan accordingly. Such prediction should be probabilistic, to address the uncertainties in human behavior. Such prediction should also be interactive, since the distribution over all possible trajectories of the predicted vehicle depends not only on historical information, but also on future plans of other vehicles that interact with it. To achieve such interaction-aware predictions, we propose a probabilistic prediction approach based on hierarchical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). First, we explicitly consider the hierarchical trajectory-generation process of human drivers involving both discrete and continuous driving decisions. Based on this, the distribution over all future trajectories of the predicted vehicle is formulated as a mixture of distributions partitioned by the discrete decisions. Then we apply IRL hierarchically to learn the distributions from real human demonstrations. A case study for the ramp-merging driving scenario is provided. The quantitative results show that the proposed approach can accurately predict both the discrete driving decisions such as yield or pass as well as the continuous trajectories.",0

The proposed method builds upon traditional irl by incorporating probabilistic reasoning and decision making into the framework. The use of probabilities allows us to better capture uncertainty and ambiguity in driving situations, improving our ability to make accurate predictions of driver actions. Our approach uses a hierarchy of subgoals that reflect different levels of abstraction in driving decisions. By modeling drivers as rational agents who maximize their expected return based on these subgoals, we can more accurately simulate human-like behaviors in traffic scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in predicting driving behavior under various conditions, outperforming baseline methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Overall, our work has important implications for automotive safety systems and future applications of artificial intelligence in transportation.",1
"Rogue is a famous dungeon-crawling video-game of the 80ies, the ancestor of its gender. Rogue-like games are known for the necessity to explore partially observable and always different randomly-generated labyrinths, preventing any form of level replay. As such, they serve as a very natural and challenging task for reinforcement learning, requiring the acquisition of complex, non-reactive behaviors involving memory and planning. In this article we show how, exploiting a version of A3C partitioned on different situations, the agent is able to reach the stairs and descend to the next level in 98% of cases.",0
"This is a research paper that presents a methodology called crawling in Rogue's dungeon using partitioned A3C. In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing algorithms that can learn to play complex games such as Go, chess, and Dota 2. However, there are many other types of games that have yet to be explored by machine learning techniques. One example is the classic computer game Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (also known as simply ""Roguelike"" or ""rogue""). These types of games offer unique challenges due to their procedural generation, permadeath mechanic, and lack of clear feedback during training. Despite these difficulties, they provide important opportunities for studying general artificial intelligence since success often requires developing heuristics to balance exploration and exploitation, managing resources effectively, and understanding the long-term implications of actions taken early on in the game. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach based on reinforcement learning from human demonstrations and online learning via A3C. We evaluate our methods through extensive experiments on various levels of difficulty and demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our work offers new insights into the application of deep reinforcement learning to open-ended domains where limited supervision is available and the environment poses unique challenges for exploration and decision making. By providing empirical evidence for a class of challenging games beyond popular board games like Chess and Go, our findings could inspire further research in this direction.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has obtained significant breakthroughs in recent years. Most methods in deep-RL achieve good results via the maximization of the reward signal provided by the environment, typically in the form of discounted cumulative returns. Such reward signals represent the immediate feedback of a particular action performed by an agent. However, tasks with sparse reward signals are still challenging to on-policy methods. In this paper, we introduce an effective characterization of past reward statistics (which can be seen as long-term feedback signals) to supplement this immediate reward feedback. In particular, value functions are learned with multi-critics supervision, enabling complex value functions to be more easily approximated in on-policy learning, even when the reward signals are sparse. We also introduce a novel exploration mechanism called ""hot-wiring"" that can give a boost to seemingly trapped agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our advantage actor multi-critic (A2MC) method across the discrete domains in Atari games as well as continuous domains in the MuJoCo environments. A video demo is provided at https://youtu.be/zBmpf3Yz8tc.",0
"Here we present an algorithm that can perform on policy learning by accumulating rewards without necessarily interacting with the environment through trial and error. We show how statistical analysis enables us to learn from observed interactions instead. Our method allows agents to improve their performance even further by leveraging previously unseen data points, which in turn increases efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional model free methods like Q-learning or SARSA. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates across different domains, including Atari games, robotics problems and locomotion tasks, making it applicable in practice.",1
"Experience replay is an important technique for addressing sample-inefficiency in deep reinforcement learning (RL), but faces difficulty in learning from binary and sparse rewards due to disproportionately few successful experiences in the replay buffer. Hindsight experience replay (HER) was recently proposed to tackle this difficulty by manipulating unsuccessful transitions, but in doing so, HER introduces a significant bias in the replay buffer experiences and therefore achieves a suboptimal improvement in sample-efficiency. In this paper, we present an analysis on the source of bias in HER, and propose a simple and effective method to counter the bias, to most effectively harness the sample-efficiency provided by HER. Our method, motivated by counter-factual reasoning and called ARCHER, extends HER with a trade-off to make rewards calculated for hindsight experiences numerically greater than real rewards. We validate our algorithm on two continuous control environments from DeepMind Control Suite - Reacher and Finger, which simulate manipulation tasks with a robotic arm - in combination with various reward functions, task complexities and goal sampling strategies. Our experiments consistently demonstrate that countering bias using more aggressive hindsight rewards increases sample efficiency, thus establishing the greater benefit of ARCHER in RL applications with limited computing budget.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using deep learning techniques for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis and question answering. However, training these models can be challenging due to issues such as overfitting and dataset biases. One popular approach to address these problems is through experience replay, where the model samples from previously seen examples during training to provide more diverse input data. While effective, traditional experience replay methods often suffer from high computational costs and slow convergence rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called ARCHER that uses aggressive rewards to counteract bias in hindsight experience replay. Our results show that ARCHER outperforms baseline methods on multiple NLP benchmarks while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. We believe our findings have important implications for the development of efficient and accurate deep learning models for NLP tasks.",1
"We apply neural nets with ReLU gates in online reinforcement learning. Our goal is to train these networks in an incremental manner, without the computationally expensive experience replay. By studying how individual neural nodes behave in online training, we recognize that the global nature of ReLU gates can cause undesirable learning interference in each node's learning behavior. We propose reducing such interferences with two efficient input transformation methods that are geometric in nature and match well the geometric property of ReLU gates. The first one is tile coding, a classic binary encoding scheme originally designed for local generalization based on the topological structure of the input space. The second one (EmECS) is a new method we introduce; it is based on geometric properties of convex sets and topological embedding of the input space into the boundary of a convex set. We discuss the behavior of the network when it operates on the transformed inputs. We also compare it experimentally with some neural nets that do not use the same input transformations, and with the classic algorithm of tile coding plus a linear function approximator, and on several online reinforcement learning tasks, we show that the neural net with tile coding or EmECS can achieve not only faster learning but also more accurate approximations. Our results strongly suggest that geometric input transformation of this type can be effective for interference reduction and takes us a step closer to fully incremental reinforcement learning with neural nets.",0
"This would be unacceptable. Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) agents to make decisions on our behalf. One approach that has gained popularity is deep Q-learning with experience replay, which combines traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms with techniques from classical statistical machine learning. While this method has proven effective in many applications, it often requires large amounts of training data and computational resources. As such, new approaches are constantly sought after to improve the performance of these systems without significantly increasing their resource requirements. Here we propose two novel geometric transformations for representing high-dimensional input streams in order to increase the efficiency of deep Q-learning with experience replay. We demonstrate through simulation experiments that both methods can substantially reduce computational costs while still producing accurate results across a variety of benchmark tasks. These contributions have important implications for the development of intelligent decision making systems, as they provide a path towards more efficient and scalable solutions that can operate within tight constraints on time and computational power.

"Research in deep reinforcement learning (RL) has coalesced around improving performance on benchmarks like the Arcade Learning Environment. However, these benchmarks conspicuously miss important characteristics like abrupt context-dependent shifts in strategy and temporal sensitivity that are often present in real-world domains. As a result, RL research has not focused on these challenges, resulting in algorithms which do not understand critical changes in context, and have little notion of real world time. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces the game of Space Fortress as a RL benchmark which incorporates these characteristics. We show that existing state-of-the-art RL algorithms are unable to learn to play the Space Fortress game. We then confirm that this poor performance is due to the RL algorithms' context insensitivity and reward sparsity. We also identify independent axes along which to vary context and temporal sensitivity, allowing Space Fortress to be used as a testbed for understanding both characteristics in combination and also in isolation. We release Space Fortress as an open-source Gym environment.",0
"While reinforcement learning has shown great success in solving complex problems across many domains, it faces significant challenges when dealing with tasks that involve contextual reasoning and temporal planning. These difficulties arise due to the need for effective representation and processing of sequences of observations, actions, and rewards over time, often under uncertain and changing environments. To address these issues and advance research in RL algorithms capable of handling sequential decision making tasks with context and time constraints, we introduce Space Fortress, a new benchmark problem inspired by real-world scenarios such as space exploration and orbital mechanics. This paper presents Space Fortress, describes its design principles, discusses some preliminary results obtained using state-of-the-art RL algorithms on this task, and highlights opportunities for future work in developing more robust RL agents equipped with representations and models able to effectively handle tasks involving context and time complexity. By providing a novel and demanding benchmark problem focused specifically on these aspects of decision making under uncertainty, we aim to foster progress in the development of next generation RL methods better suited to solve real-world applications characterized by intricate spatiotemporal dynamics.",1
"We introduce Interactive Question Answering (IQA), the task of answering questions that require an autonomous agent to interact with a dynamic visual environment. IQA presents the agent with a scene and a question, like: ""Are there any apples in the fridge?"" The agent must navigate around the scene, acquire visual understanding of scene elements, interact with objects (e.g. open refrigerators) and plan for a series of actions conditioned on the question. Popular reinforcement learning approaches with a single controller perform poorly on IQA owing to the large and diverse state space. We propose the Hierarchical Interactive Memory Network (HIMN), consisting of a factorized set of controllers, allowing the system to operate at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. To evaluate HIMN, we introduce IQUAD V1, a new dataset built upon AI2-THOR, a simulated photo-realistic environment of configurable indoor scenes with interactive objects (code and dataset available at https://github.com/danielgordon10/thor-iqa-cvpr-2018). IQUAD V1 has 75,000 questions, each paired with a unique scene configuration. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms popular single controller based methods on IQUAD V1.

"Considering its advantages in dealing with high-dimensional visual input and learning control policies in discrete domain, Deep Q Network (DQN) could be an alternative method of traditional auto-focus means in the future. In this paper, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, we propose an end-to-end approach that can learn auto-focus policies from visual input and finish at a clear spot automatically. We demonstrate that our method - discretizing the action space with coarse to fine steps and applying DQN is not only a solution to auto-focus but also a general approach towards vision-based control problems. Separate phases of training in virtual and real environments are applied to obtain an effective model. Virtual experiments, which are carried out after the virtual training phase, indicates that our method could achieve 100% accuracy on a certain view with different focus range. Further training on real robots could eliminate the deviation between the simulator and real scenario, leading to reliable performances in real applications.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been revolutionizing the automation industry by enabling robots to perform complex tasks autonomously.

We use an off-the-shelf drone platform equipped with a monocular camera as our test bed. Our approach learns through trial-and-error interactions in simulation using Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which then guides the drone to learn optimal actions in real-time. Our experiments show promising results, demonstrating better performance over conventional methods like manual tuning of parameters or rule-based systems. Additionally, we also present analysis of the learned policies providing insight into how our method operates. Overall, this research opens new possibilities for deploying robust and flexible robotics systems that can interact seamlessly with dynamic environments without requiring human intervention.",1
"Recently deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved outstanding success on solving many difficult and large-scale RL problems. However the high sample cost required for effective learning often makes DRL unaffordable in resource-limited applications. With the aim of improving sample efficiency and learning performance, we will develop a new DRL algorithm in this paper that seamless integrates entropy-induced and bootstrap-induced techniques for efficient and deep exploration of the learning environment. Specifically, a general form of Tsallis entropy regularizer will be utilized to drive entropy-induced exploration based on efficient approximation of optimal action-selection policies. Different from many existing works that rely on action dithering strategies for exploration, our algorithm is efficient in exploring actions with clear exploration value. Meanwhile, by employing an ensemble of Q-networks under varied Tsallis entropy regularization, the diversity of the ensemble can be further enhanced to enable effective bootstrap-induced exploration. Experiments on Atari game playing tasks clearly demonstrate that our new algorithm can achieve more efficient and effective exploration for DRL, in comparison to recently proposed exploration methods including Bootstrapped Deep Q-Network and UCB Q-Ensemble.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach to solve complex problems across various domains.

"In the past few years, deep reinforcement learning has been proven to solve problems which have complex states like video games or board games. The next step of intelligent agents would be able to generalize between tasks, and using prior experience to pick up new skills more quickly. However, most reinforcement learning algorithms for now are often suffering from catastrophic forgetting even when facing a very similar target task. Our approach enables the agents to generalize knowledge from a single source task, and boost the learning progress with a semisupervised learning method when facing a new task. We evaluate this approach on Atari games, which is a popular reinforcement learning benchmark, and show that it outperforms common baselines based on pre-training and fine-tuning.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has proven itself as a powerful tool for training agents to perform complex tasks such as playing games or controlling robots. One key challenge facing deep reinforcement learning is that it often requires large amounts of data and computational resources to train successful models. This can make it difficult to apply these techniques to domains where data may be limited or expensive to acquire. To address this issue, we propose using adversarial objectives and augmentations during training to improve the efficiency and generality of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Our approach involves training agents alongside a separate neural network designed to predict future states given only small perturbations of the input state. By adding regularization terms based on the performance of this prediction network, we encourage the agent to learn representations that are robust against small variations in its inputs. We show that our method leads to significant improvements in both sample efficiency and generalization across different environments, compared to standard deep reinforcement learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate how our technique can be used in conjunction with existing augmentation strategies to further enhance performance. Overall, our work represents an important step towards making deep reinforcement learning more efficient and applicable to real world problems where data availability may be limited.",1
"Most existing video summarisation methods are based on either supervised or unsupervised learning.

Specifically, We formulate video summarisation as a sequential decision-making process and train a summarisation network with deep Q-learning (DQSN). A companion classification network is also trained to provide rewards for training the DQSN. With the classification network, we develop a global recognisability reward based on the classification result. Critically, a novel dense ranking-based reward is also proposed in order to cope with the temporally delayed and sparse reward problems for long sequence reinforcement learning.

"We address the problem of learning hierarchical deep neural network policies for reinforcement learning. In contrast to methods that explicitly restrict or cripple lower layers of a hierarchy to force them to use higher-level modulating signals, each layer in our framework is trained to directly solve the task, but acquires a range of diverse strategies via a maximum entropy reinforcement learning objective. Each layer is also augmented with latent random variables, which are sampled from a prior distribution during the training of that layer. The maximum entropy objective causes these latent variables to be incorporated into the layer's policy, and the higher level layer can directly control the behavior of the lower layer through this latent space. Furthermore, by constraining the mapping from latent variables to actions to be invertible, higher layers retain full expressivity: neither the higher layers nor the lower layers are constrained in their behavior. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can improve on the performance of single-layer policies on standard benchmark tasks simply by adding additional layers, and that our method can solve more complex sparse-reward tasks by learning higher-level policies on top of high-entropy skills optimized for simple low-level objectives.",0

"This paper explores the use of deep reinforcement learning agents to transfer knowledge from one environment to another. More specifically, the method takes advantage of asynchronous advantage actor critic (A3C) architecture to generalize a target game using an agent trained on a source game in Atari. Instead of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for the target game, we propose a learning approach to update the model using multiple agents trained in parallel with different representations of the target game. Visual mapping between video sequences of transfer pairs is used to derive new representations of the target game; training on these visual representations of the target game improves model updates in terms of performance, data efficiency and stability. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the architecture, Atari games Pong-v0 and Breakout-v0 are being used from the OpenAI gym environment; as the source and target environment.",0
"Our work addresses how agents can learn new skills efficiently by training on many tasks at once. We introduce competitive reinforcement learning (CRL), where multiple deep Q-networks compete over credit attribution for their shared actions’ impacts on task rewards across tasks. CRL exploits intrinsic motivation—such as curiosity about novel states—to encourage exploration toward hard-explored or high-reward states across tasks. These ideas are implemented into agent architectures that perform well on diverse challenging continuous control benchmark problems from OpenAI Gym/Atari. In both centralized training/decentralized execution settings our models achieve record performance across several games while requiring orders of magnitude fewer interactions than prior methods. Moreover, these results transfer even better to unseen games: achieving human-level average scores in seven games without further interaction, whereas SOTA alternating RL baselines fail to reach playable levels even given ten times more interactions per game. Our models exhibit desirable behavior like learning meaningful internal representations. Code and trained models available online allow easy reproducibility; we hope that our findings inspire further improvements to multi-task deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

"Recent success in deep reinforcement learning is having an agent learn how to play Go and beat the world champion without any prior knowledge of the game. In that task, the agent has to make a decision on what action to take based on the positions of the pieces. Person Search is recently explored using natural language based text description of images for video surveillance applications (S.Li et.al). We see (Fu.et al) provides an end to end approach for object-based retrieval using deep reinforcement learning without constraints placed on which objects are being detected. However, we believe for real-world applications such as person search defining specific constraints which identify a person as opposed to starting with a general object detection will have benefits in terms of performance and computational resources required. In our task, Deep reinforcement learning would localize the person in an image by reshaping the sizes of the bounding boxes. Deep Reinforcement learning with appropriate constraints would look only for the relevant person in the image as opposed to an unconstrained approach where each individual objects in the image are ranked. For person search, the agent is trying to form a tight bounding box around the person in the image who matches the description. The bounding box is initialized to the full image and at each time step, the agent makes a decision on how to change the current bounding box so that it has a tighter bound around the person based on the description of the person and the pixel values of the current bounding box. After the agent takes an action, it will be given a reward based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the current bounding box and the ground truth box. Once the agent believes that the bounding box is covering the person, it will indicate that the person is found.",0

"We introduce a new virtual environment for simulating a card game known as ""Big 2"". This is a four-player game of imperfect information with a relatively complicated action space (being allowed to play 1,2,3,4 or 5 card combinations from an initial starting hand of 13 cards). As such it poses a challenge for many current reinforcement learning methods. We then use the recently proposed ""Proximal Policy Optimization"" algorithm to train a deep neural network to play the game, purely learning via self-play, and find that it is able to reach a level which outperforms amateur human players after only a relatively short amount of training time and without needing to search a tree of future game states.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been used successfully to train agents for two-player perfect information games such as chess and Go. However, training RL agents for multiplayer games of imperfect information is more challenging due to the difficulty in determining which actions lead to positive rewards. In this paper, we propose the use of self-play reinforcement learning (SPRL), where each agent learns from its own experiences while playing against other learned agents. We apply SPRL to a four-player card game called Twixt, and demonstrate that our method results in stronger policies compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show that SPRL outperforms both Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Q-learning in terms of win rate and number of moves taken before reaching a draw. Additionally, we evaluate the robustness of our approach by testing it on different initial board configurations, and find that SPRL remains competitive even under these varying conditions. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of using SPRL for improving decision making in multiplayer games of imperfect information. Further research can expand upon this framework to tackle larger multiplayer games or other complex domains with uncertainty.",1
"Estimating the value function for a fixed policy is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning. Policy evaluation algorithms---to estimate value functions---continue to be developed, to improve convergence rates, improve stability and handle variability, particularly for off-policy learning. To understand the properties of these algorithms, the experimenter needs high-confidence estimates of the accuracy of the learned value functions. For environments with small, finite state-spaces, like chains, the true value function can be easily computed, to compute accuracy. For large, or continuous state-spaces, however, this is no longer feasible. In this paper, we address the largely open problem of how to obtain these high-confidence estimates, for general state-spaces. We provide a high-confidence bound on an empirical estimate of the value error to the true value error. We use this bound to design an offline sampling algorithm, which stores the required quantities to repeatedly compute value error estimates for any learned value function. We provide experiments investigating the number of samples required by this offline algorithm in simple benchmark reinforcement learning domains, and highlight that there are still many open questions to be solved for this important problem.",0

"Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective approach for improving the performance of neural machine translation (NMT) system. However, due to its instability, successfully RL training is challenging, especially in real-world systems where deep models and large datasets are leveraged. In this paper, taking several large-scale translation tasks as testbeds, we conduct a systematic study on how to train better NMT models using reinforcement learning. We provide a comprehensive comparison of several important factors (e.g., baseline reward, reward shaping) in RL training. Furthermore, to fill in the gap that it remains unclear whether RL is still beneficial when monolingual data is used, we propose a new method to leverage RL to further boost the performance of NMT systems trained with source/target monolingual data. By integrating all our findings, we obtain competitive results on WMT14 English- German, WMT17 English-Chinese, and WMT17 Chinese-English translation tasks, especially setting a state-of-the-art performance on WMT17 Chinese-English translation task.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have become increasingly popular due to their ability to automatically learn complex representations from raw data. In particular, techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) can leverage these powerful models to optimize high-level control policies. One area where this has been applied with success is Natural Language Processing (NLP). We focus on one specific NLP task: machine translation, which involves translating text from one language to another. Our research investigates how RL algorithms can improve state-of-the-art sequence prediction models like those based on Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformers to create better Machine Translation systems. For instance, we demonstrate that by combining modern RL architectures like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Gumbel Softmax Temperature Scaling, Beam Search Decoding with Shaping, Sequence Losses and Human Feedback into existing frameworks like Open Assistant, we can significantly enhance their performance on several benchmark datasets in terms of BLEU scores against human references. We thoroughly analyze and discuss our results to provide insights into key factors affecting model quality such as reward shaping, exploration strategies, training stability and dataset size. Finally, we discuss future directions for leveraging reinforcement learning to advance natural language understanding even further. This study highlights the potential benefits of using modern RL approaches to drive more effective language processing pipelines, ultimately contributing to improved communication across different languages and cultures. This is not directly related, but I wanted to provide you some feedback on your writing style. Overall, it sounds very professional, clear and easy to read. However, there were couple instances of awkward phrasing that made me stumble a bit while reading aloud, e.g.: ""leverag[ing] these powerful models to optimiz[e] high-level control policies.""

"We examine the problem of learning and planning on high-dimensional domains with long horizons and sparse rewards. Recent approaches have shown great successes in many Atari 2600 domains. However, domains with long horizons and sparse rewards, such as Montezuma's Revenge and Venture, remain challenging for existing methods. Methods using abstraction (Dietterich 2000; Sutton, Precup, and Singh 1999) have shown to be useful in tackling long-horizon problems. We combine recent techniques of deep reinforcement learning with existing model-based approaches using an expert-provided state abstraction. We construct toy domains that elucidate the problem of long horizons, sparse rewards and high-dimensional inputs, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous methods on these domains. Our abstraction-based approach outperforms Deep Q-Networks (Mnih et al. 2015) on Montezuma's Revenge and Venture, and exhibits backtracking behavior that is absent from previous methods.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have made significant strides towards developing intelligent systems capable of solving complex real world problems. In particular, reinforcement learning algorithms such as DQN (Deep Q Network) have shown great promise in enabling agents to learn from trial and error by maximizing their expected cumulative reward. However, these methods often suffer from instability and high sample complexity due to the use of approximate value functions that may overestimate the true values and lead to poor convergence rates. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel algorithm called ""Deep Abstract Q-networks"" (DAQN) which combines two complementary techniques: abstract q-functions and bootstrapped RL.  The DAQN architecture consists of multiple abstract Q networks that share the same network architecture but differ in the level of abstraction they offer. Each agent maintains a priority queue containing the most promising state-action pairs based on the corresponding abstract Q-values. During training, the agent explores the environment using the highest priority state-action pair selected from the queue and updates the abstract Q-value estimates accordingly. As the agent learns more about the environment and the underlying dynamics, the abstraction levels become less important, resulting in improved performance and efficient training.  To further improve the stability and efficiency of the DAQN method, we incorporate bootstrapping into our framework to stabilize the learning process. Bootstrapping involves utilizing previously learned models to estimate target Q-values, making them easier to track during training. This improves the estimation accuracy of the target model and reduces oscillations caused by unstable targets. Our extensive experimental evaluation across several Atari games demonstrates that DAQN outperforms prior art reinforcement learning algorithms significantly, achieving higher rewards and faster convergence speeds while maintaining stable behavior throughout training. These results suggest that DAQN holds grea",1
"Indoor navigation aims at performing navigation within buildings. In scenes like home and factory, most intelligent mobile devices require an functionality of routing to guide itself precisely through indoor scenes to complete various tasks in order to serve human. In most scenarios, we expected an intelligent device capable of navigating itself in unseen environment. Although several solutions have been proposed to deal with this issue, they usually require pre-installed beacons or a map pre-built with SLAM, which means that they are not capable of working in novel environments. To address this, we proposed NavigationNet, a computer vision dataset and benchmark to allow the utilization of deep reinforcement learning on scene-understanding-based indoor navigation. We also proposed and formalized several typical indoor routing problems that are suitable for deep reinforcement learning.",0
"Here we present ""NavigationNet"" a large scale interactive indoor navigation dataset which consists of 428 rooms spread across two building blocks and 70K images annotated by real human users. We collected all data over three weeks using crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) resulting in around 92k task completions. Using this data we train deep neural network models that achieve state of the art performance on both the standard evaluation metrics as well as the more challenging user-centric measure we propose in this work. Additionally, our study reveals interesting insights into how humans perform such tasks compared to current algorithms.",1
"We study offline data poisoning attacks in contextual bandits, a class of reinforcement learning problems with important applications in online recommendation and adaptive medical treatment, among others. We provide a general attack framework based on convex optimization and show that by slightly manipulating rewards in the data, an attacker can force the bandit algorithm to pull a target arm for a target contextual vector. The target arm and target contextual vector are both chosen by the attacker. That is, the attacker can hijack the behavior of a contextual bandit. We also investigate the feasibility and the side effects of such attacks, and identify future directions for defense. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficiency of the attack algorithm.",0
"Abstract:  Contextual bandit algorithms have gained popularity due to their ability to quickly adapt to changes in environments by learning from feedback. However, these algorithms can suffer from data poisoning attacks where adversaries manipulate the algorithm's inputs to cause incorrect decisions. In this work, we investigate data poisoning attacks in contextual bandit settings and propose countermeasures to address them. Our approach involves designing robust models that can detect and mitigate malicious input perturbations. We evaluate our techniques on benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in performance against poisoning attacks compared to baseline methods. This research has important implications for secure decision making under uncertainty in real-world applications such as recommendation systems, resource allocation, and healthcare. Overall, our study contributes to the development of more resilient reinforcement learning algorithms that can better handle adversarial challenges.",1
"Reinforcement learning approaches have long appealed to the data management community due to their ability to learn to control dynamic behavior from raw system performance. Recent successes in combining deep neural networks with reinforcement learning have sparked significant new interest in this domain. However, practical solutions remain elusive due to large training data requirements, algorithmic instability, and lack of standard tools. In this work, we introduce LIFT, an end-to-end software stack for applying deep reinforcement learning to data management tasks. While prior work has frequently explored applications in simulations, LIFT centers on utilizing human expertise to learn from demonstrations, thus lowering online training times. We further introduce TensorForce, a TensorFlow library for applied deep reinforcement learning exposing a unified declarative interface to common RL algorithms, thus providing a backend to LIFT. We demonstrate the utility of LIFT in two case studies in database compound indexing and resource management in stream processing. Results show LIFT controllers initialized from demonstrations can outperform human baselines and heuristics across latency metrics and space usage by up to 70%.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing intelligent computer systems that can learn from demonstration (LfD) to perform complex tasks autonomously. One popular approach to LfD is reinforcement learning (RL), where an agent learns through trial and error to maximize rewards while minimizing costs. However, RL algorithms often require large amounts of data to converge and may still fail due to sparse reward signals or poor exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm called Learning via Forward Transfer (LIFT) that leverages prior knowledge learned during early stages of training to improve performance on later stages. By using task-specific priors obtained from previous experience, our method adapts quickly to changing environments without needing additional data. Our experiments show that LIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both navigation and manipulation domains while requiring fewer trials and computation resources. Overall, our work advances the field of RL-based LfD towards more efficient and effective solutions in robotics and other applications.",1
"In this paper we discuss policy iteration methods for approximate solution of a finite-state discounted Markov decision problem, with a focus on feature-based aggregation methods and their connection with deep reinforcement learning schemes. We introduce features of the states of the original problem, and we formulate a smaller ""aggregate"" Markov decision problem, whose states relate to the features. We discuss properties and possible implementations of this type of aggregation, including a new approach to approximate policy iteration. In this approach the policy improvement operation combines feature-based aggregation with feature construction using deep neural networks or other calculations. We argue that the cost function of a policy may be approximated much more accurately by the nonlinear function of the features provided by aggregation, than by the linear function of the features provided by neural network-based reinforcement learning, thereby potentially leading to more effective policy improvement.",0
"In summary, we describe herein the results from our research into how feature-based aggregation can enhance performance in deep reinforcement learning models. We conducted experiments using both established benchmarks and newly developed methods, which allowed us to test different aspects of these approaches. Our findings show that feature-based aggregation leads to improved learning outcomes across a wide range of environments and task types. Furthermore, we propose new implementations of feature-based aggregation architectures, including FLAGA and GAFFER, that achieve state-of-the-art performance on several challenging domains. Finally, we discuss possible applications of these advances beyond traditional RL problems and highlight promising directions for future work. Overall, our study makes significant contributions towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DRL algorithms and broaden their potential impact in real-world scenarios.",1
This paper describes some of the possibilities of artificial neural networks that open up after solving the problem of catastrophic forgetting. A simple model and reinforcement learning applications of existing methods are also proposed.,0
"In this paper, we examine the phenomenon known as ""catastrophic forgetting,"" which occurs when a neural network trained on one task experiences severe degradation in performance when subsequent learning processes new knowledge. Despite significant advancements in the field of machine learning, catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge that hinders the development of truly intelligent artificial systems capable of handling dynamic real-world environments. We investigate both theoretical aspects of the problem, including analysis of the underlying mechanisms, and experimental efforts to mitigate the impact of catastrophic forgetting through regularization techniques such as elastic weight consolidation (EWC) and synaptic intelligence (SI). Our findings highlight the crucial role of regularization methods in preserving learned knowledge while continuing to adapt to novel situations. By understanding and addressing catastrophic forgetting, we can improve the stability and resilience of neural networks, bringing us closer to achieving more advanced forms of artificial intelligence. This work has important implications for numerous applications across fields from robotics to healthcare, where continuous lifelong learning and adaptation remain vital requirements.",1
"Deep neuroevolution, that is evolutionary policy search methods based on deep neural networks, have recently emerged as a competitor to deep reinforcement learning algorithms due to their better parallelization capabilities. However, these methods still suffer from a far worse sample efficiency. In this paper we investigate whether a mechanism known as ""importance mixing"" can significantly improve their sample efficiency. We provide a didactic presentation of importance mixing and we explain how it can be extended to reuse more samples. Then, from an empirical comparison based on a simple benchmark, we show that, though it actually provides better sample efficiency, it is still far from the sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning, though it is more stable.",0
"In many real world decision making tasks, acquiring data can be difficult, expensive and sometimes even dangerous. For example, imagine you want to optimize how resources like water, food and energy are distributed across different regions, but collecting that data requires sending teams on potentially hazardous expeditions through rough terrain or conflict zones - the benefits of improved efficiency simply don’t justify risking human life. As such, there are many applications where one would like to learn as quickly as possible while only using as few datapoints as absolutely necessary to achieve satisfactory results.   A common approach for learning from limited data is called “evolutionary computation,” which means training a population of candidates by simulating natural selection. When applying these algorithms to continuous control problems (like steering a robot arm) we often use “reinforcement learning” techniques because they allow us to efficiently learn rewards without explicitly telling our program how good things are. While some RL algorithms actually need little more than simple linear functions and gradients, others require very expressive models and access to large amounts of data. To make the most efficient use out of both types of models, researchers have developed a technique known as ‘importance sampling,’ which trades off using fewer high quality demonstrations versus larger number of lower quality examples when collecting data for training your algorithm. Our paper shows experimentally for the first time to our knowledge, that a certain variant commonly used for deep neural nets called TD(0) has advantages over previous state-of-the art approaches especially for higher dimensional action spaces encountered in real world problems. While the authors acknowledge that it might not always work better than other options, we hope this provides yet another tool for researchers working o",1
"One of the major challenges of model-free visual tracking problem has been the difficulty originating from the unpredictable and drastic changes in the appearance of objects we target to track. Existing methods tackle this problem by updating the appearance model on-line in order to adapt to the changes in the appearance. Despite the success of these methods however, inaccurate and erroneous updates of the appearance model result in a tracker drift. In this paper, we introduce a novel real-time visual tracking algorithm based on a template selection strategy constructed by deep reinforcement learning methods. The tracking algorithm utilizes this strategy to choose the appropriate template for tracking a given frame. The template selection strategy is self-learned by utilizing a simple policy gradient method on numerous training episodes randomly generated from a tracking benchmark dataset. Our proposed reinforcement learning framework is generally applicable to other confidence map based tracking algorithms. The experiment shows that our tracking algorithm runs in real-time speed of 43 fps and the proposed policy network effectively decides the appropriate template for successful visual tracking.",0
"In this paper, we present a new approach for real-time visual object tracking using deep reinforcement learning. Our method leverages a stateful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract high-level features from image frames, which are then used as input for a Q-learning algorithm that learns to make decisions based on these features. We trained our model on large amounts of data collected from online videos featuring objects moving in complex environments, allowing our agent to learn robust representations of different scenarios.  The key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to adaptively select actions at each time step based on current observations and rewards received during training. By utilizing a stateful CNN architecture, our system can effectively track objects even if they undergo significant changes in appearance over time due to variations in lighting conditions, occlusions, and other factors. Additionally, since the Q-value function used in our decision process takes into account both short-term reward signals and longer-term discounted rewards, our agent is able to balance immediate gains with long-term goals when choosing actions, resulting in more accurate and stable tracking performance.  We evaluated our method against several popular benchmark datasets for object tracking, demonstrating significantly better results compared to previous approaches employing handcrafted features or end-to-end deep networks without explicit feedback mechanisms. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we identified specific design choices that improved performance and provided insights into the working of our proposed framework. Overall, our work shows the potential of integrating deep reinforcement learning with computer vision techniques for solving challenging sequential decision problems like visual tracking, paving the way for future research in this direction.",1
"Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and general framework for decision making and control, but its application in practice is often hindered by the need for extensive feature and reward engineering. Deep reinforcement learning methods can remove the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still require a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning holds the promise of automatic reward acquisition, but has proven exceptionally difficult to apply to large, high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. In this work, we propose adverserial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training. Our experiments show that AIRL greatly outperforms prior methods in these transfer settings.",0
"Advances in artificial intelligence have paved the way for machines to make complex decisions that were once exclusive to human experts. However, these decision-making processes often require clear reward functions that inform the machine on how well it is performing. Traditionally, these rewards are designed manually by domain experts who must thoroughly understand the problem at hand. Yet, designing reliable rewards remains challenging as they may degrade over time due to changes in environment or task requirements. To address this challenge, we propose adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), which learns robust reward functions from demonstrations generated by an expert policy without explicit supervision. Our approach utilizes generative adversarial imitation learning to stabilize the learning process while an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm infers the underlying reward function. Empirical evaluation shows that our method can learn more accurate and robust reward functions compared to traditional approaches across multiple domains, including Atari games, robotics, and driving environments. These results demonstrate the potential of AIRL to automate reward engineering, thus accelerating the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning algorithms rely on carefully engineering environment rewards that are extrinsic to the agent. However, annotating each environment with hand-designed, dense rewards is not scalable, motivating the need for developing reward functions that are intrinsic to the agent. Curiosity is a type of intrinsic reward function which uses prediction error as reward signal. In this paper: (a) We perform the first large-scale study of purely curiosity-driven learning, i.e. without any extrinsic rewards, across 54 standard benchmark environments, including the Atari game suite. Our results show surprisingly good performance, and a high degree of alignment between the intrinsic curiosity objective and the hand-designed extrinsic rewards of many game environments. (b) We investigate the effect of using different feature spaces for computing prediction error and show that random features are sufficient for many popular RL game benchmarks, but learned features appear to generalize better (e.g. to novel game levels in Super Mario Bros.). (c) We demonstrate limitations of the prediction-based rewards in stochastic setups. Game-play videos and code are at https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning techniques that rely on intrinsic motivation, rather than explicit rewards or punishments. One such approach, known as curiosity-driven learning, involves training agents to actively seek out new knowledge and experiences in order to improve their understanding of the world. This study seeks to advance our understanding of curiosity-driven learning by conducting a large-scale investigation into how different aspects of the environment and agent design can impact the efficacy of these methods. Our results demonstrate that certain environmental factors and architectural choices can have significant effects on both the efficiency and quality of exploration, suggesting new strategies for improving artificial intelligence systems. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers working in fields ranging from computer science to psychology, highlighting the importance of considering both environment and architecture when studying complex systems. Overall, this work represents a step towards creating more adaptive and autonomous machines, paving the way for future advancements in artificial intelligence.",1
"We present an approach for reconfiguration of dynamic visual sensor networks with deep reinforcement learning (RL). Our RL agent uses a modified asynchronous advantage actor-critic framework and the recently proposed Relational Network module at the foundation of its network architecture. To address the issue of sample inefficiency in current approaches to model-free reinforcement learning, we train our system in an abstract simulation environment that represents inputs from a dynamic scene. Our system is validated using inputs from a real-world scenario and preexisting object detection and tracking algorithms.",0
"In this paper we propose an algorithm that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to reconfigure visual sensor networks. Our approach addresses the problem of limited resources by allowing the sensors in the network to intelligently adjust their configuration based on the environment they observe. We use a DNN architecture called Proximal Policy Optimization to train our agents, which learn from real world data to make decisions that optimize network performance. Our experiments show significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using DRL for sensor network reconfiguration.",1
"Many currently deployed Reinforcement Learning agents work in an environment shared with humans, be them co-workers, users or clients. It is desirable that these agents adjust to people's preferences, learn faster thanks to their help, and act safely around them. We argue that most current approaches that learn from human feedback are unsafe: rewarding or punishing the agent a-posteriori cannot immediately prevent it from wrong-doing. In this paper, we extend Policy Gradient to make it robust to external directives, that would otherwise break the fundamentally on-policy nature of Policy Gradient. Our technique, Directed Policy Gradient (DPG), allows a teacher or backup policy to override the agent before it acts undesirably, while allowing the agent to leverage human advice or directives to learn faster. Our experiments demonstrate that DPG makes the agent learn much faster than reward-based approaches, while requiring an order of magnitude less advice.",0
"One critical challenge facing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is ensuring safety during the decision-making process. Traditional RL methods often optimize only for reward maximization, without considering potential negative consequences of actions taken along the way. This can lead to behaviors that may cause harm to humans or violate ethical norms. Incorporating human feedback into the learning process has been proposed as one solution to mitigate these risks. However, current approaches suffer from drawbacks such as high sample complexity, limited scalability, and lack of adaptivity.  To address these issues, we present Directed Policy Gradient (DPG), a novel framework for safe RL with human advice. DPG combines model-free policy optimization with gradient-based planning techniques, leveraging both offline simulation and online interactions with real environments to improve performance while reducing reliance on expert knowledge. Our method adapts to user preferences through a latent variable model, allowing for flexible guidance that accommodates diverse scenarios.  We evaluate our approach using challenging benchmark tasks and demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. We show that DPG achieves better risk-reward tradeoffs by balancing exploration and exploitation under uncertainty. Moreover, we conduct extensive ablation studies to validate the contributions of different components in our design, highlighting their individual impacts on safety and guidance capabilities.  Our work contributes to the growing body of research focused on developing robust solutions for safe RL in complex systems interacting with humans. By integrating advanced computational tools and theoretical insights, DPG provides valuable insights for future applications where reliable decision making must account for both objective rewards and societal values.",1
"360$^{\circ}$ panoramas are a rich medium, yet notoriously difficult to visualize in the 2D image plane. We explore how intelligent rotations of a spherical image may enable content-aware projection with fewer perceptible distortions. Whereas existing approaches assume the viewpoint is fixed, intuitively some viewing angles within the sphere preserve high-level objects better than others. To discover the relationship between these optimal snap angles and the spherical panorama's content, we develop a reinforcement learning approach for the cubemap projection model. Implemented as a deep recurrent neural network, our method selects a sequence of rotation actions and receives reward for avoiding cube boundaries that overlap with important foreground objects. We show our approach creates more visually pleasing panoramas while using 5x less computation than the baseline.",0
This paper presents a method that can predict snap angles from panoramic images. Our approach uses machine learning algorithms trained on large datasets of labeled image features extracted from expertly captured panoramas. These algorithm predictions have been validated by comparing them against ground truth data collected from actual user interactions with panorama viewers. We demonstrate through quantitative evaluation our methods accuracy in predicting snap angles. Additionally we provide qualitative analysis showing how snap angles predicted by different methods impacts the overall quality of resulting panoramas. Finally our work shows potential for enabling fully automated photo editing tools using only inputting single high resolution panoramas while still maintaining desired output qualities.,1
"Policy optimization is a core component of reinforcement learning (RL), and most existing RL methods directly optimize parameters of a policy based on maximizing the expected total reward, or its surrogate. Though often achieving encouraging empirical success, its underlying mathematical principle on {\em policy-distribution} optimization is unclear. We place policy optimization into the space of probability measures, and interpret it as Wasserstein gradient flows. On the probability-measure space, under specified circumstances, policy optimization becomes a convex problem in terms of distribution optimization. To make optimization feasible, we develop efficient algorithms by numerically solving the corresponding discrete gradient flows. Our technique is applicable to several RL settings, and is related to many state-of-the-art policy-optimization algorithms. Empirical results verify the effectiveness of our framework, often obtaining better performance compared to related algorithms.",0
"Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in policy optimization using gradient based methods due to their efficiency and scalability. However, traditional gradient based approaches often suffer from high variance and can fail to converge due to issues such as nonlinearity, nonconvexity, and noisy gradients. Recent research has shown that optimizing policies by solving discrete time optimal control problems is equivalent to finding stationary solutions of continuous time optimal transportation problems known as gradient flows. These results have opened up new opportunities to exploit advanced mathematical tools developed in the area of optimal transport theory. This paper proposes a novel method for policy optimization calledPolicy OptimizationasWassersteinGradientFlows(POWGF). By formulating policy optimization as a continuous time problem we provide a natural connection between these two areas which leads to improved numerical stability over existing methods. Our method provides efficient computation of lower bounds on value function and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark tasks without requiring careful hyperparameter tuning or specialized architectures. POWGF establishes connections between the fields of reinforcement learning, optimal transport, and partial differential equations leading to exciting future prospects for further research at the intersection of these domains.

"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.",0
"In Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor (2018), we propose an algorithm that combines off-policy maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning with a stochastic actor. Our approach builds on recent advances in deep reinforcement learning by using neural networks to approximate state values and policies, while maximizing entropy to promote exploration. However, traditional methods often suffer from high variance due to their reliance on Monte Carlo sampling techniques. To overcome these limitations, our method utilizes a soft critic that learns both policy evaluation and optimization objectives simultaneously. This improves stability and enables faster convergence compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we introduce a novel formulation for computing gradient estimates that uses automatic differentiation without relying on backpropagation through time. We evaluate our method on several benchmark problems and demonstrate that it outperforms previous algorithms, including Proximal Policy Optimization. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach for training stable and efficient agents in complex domains.",1
"Reinforcement learning studies how to balance exploration and exploitation in real-world systems, optimizing interactions with the world while simultaneously learning how the world operates. One general class of algorithms for such learning is the multi-armed bandit setting. Randomized probability matching, based upon the Thompson sampling approach introduced in the 1930s, has recently been shown to perform well and to enjoy provable optimality properties. It permits generative, interpretable modeling in a Bayesian setting, where prior knowledge is incorporated, and the computed posteriors naturally capture the full state of knowledge. In this work, we harness the information contained in the Bayesian posterior and estimate its sufficient statistics via sampling. In several application domains, for example in health and medicine, each interaction with the world can be expensive and invasive, whereas drawing samples from the model is relatively inexpensive. Exploiting this viewpoint, we develop a double sampling technique driven by the uncertainty in the learning process: it favors exploitation when certain about the properties of each arm, exploring otherwise. The proposed algorithm does not make any distributional assumption and it is applicable to complex reward distributions, as long as Bayesian posterior updates are computable. Utilizing the estimated posterior sufficient statistics, double sampling autonomously balances the exploration-exploitation tradeoff to make better informed decisions. We empirically show its reduced cumulative regret when compared to state-of-the-art alternatives in representative bandit settings.",0
"In many real world applications such as advertising and online shopping, we must make sequential decisions where each decision requires us to balance the cost of making a wrong choice against the benefits of gaining new knowledge. This problem is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. One approach to solving this problem is through Bayesian bandit algorithms which allow us to use prior knowledge about possible outcomes to inform our choices. However, these methods can still struggle to find the optimal solution due to their reliance on simple heuristics or greedy approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel method called double sampling that addresses the shortcomings of existing Bayesian bandits by leveraging both probability theory and numerical optimization techniques. Our method uses a randomized process to generate two sets of samples from the uncertainty distribution over payoffs, one used for exploiting current estimates and another for updating beliefs using noisy observations. We show empirically that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the art Bayesian bandits across a variety of synthetic and real datasets while being computationally efficient. Overall, our work offers a new perspective on tackling the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and has important implications for decision makers operating under uncertain conditions.",1
"The recently proposed distributional approach to reinforcement learning (DiRL) is centered on learning the distribution of the reward-to-go, often referred to as the value distribution. In this work, we show that the distributional Bellman equation, which drives DiRL methods, is equivalent to a generative adversarial network (GAN) model. In this formulation, DiRL can be seen as learning a deep generative model of the value distribution, driven by the discrepancy between the distribution of the current value, and the distribution of the sum of current reward and next value. We use this insight to propose a GAN-based approach to DiRL, which leverages the strengths of GANs in learning distributions of high-dimensional data. In particular, we show that our GAN approach can be used for DiRL with multivariate rewards, an important setting which cannot be tackled with prior methods. The multivariate setting also allows us to unify learning the distribution of values and state transitions, and we exploit this idea to devise a novel exploration method that is driven by the discrepancy in estimating both values and states.",0
"This work presents a novel approach to multivariate policy evaluation and exploration using deep generative models called ""Bellman Generative Adversarial Networks"" (Bellman GAN). We introduce this framework as a generalization of the popular Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm that can evaluate multiple policies simultaneously while offering improved stability and sample efficiency. Our method leverages the power of adversarial training to estimate the quality of multiple policies without requiring explicit access to their corresponding value functions. We validate our approach on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks and show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across different settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Bellman GANs for high-dimensional action spaces by evaluating policies that involve both discrete actions and continuous parameters, which are challenging to handle efficiently using traditional Monte Carlo evaluation techniques. Finally, we provide insights into the inner workings of Bellman GANs through comprehensive ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, and visualizations of the learned neural representations. Our findings highlight the potential of using distributional value estimates to improve upon single-policy Q-learning algorithms, opening new opportunities for developing more efficient and effective machine learning systems for sequential decision making under uncertainty.",1
"We propose a reinforcement learning approach for real-time exposure control of a mobile camera that is personalizable. Our approach is based on Markov Decision Process (MDP). In the camera viewfinder or live preview mode, given the current frame, our system predicts the change in exposure so as to optimize the trade-off among image quality, fast convergence, and minimal temporal oscillation. We model the exposure prediction function as a fully convolutional neural network that can be trained through Gaussian policy gradient in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, our system can associate scene semantics with exposure values; it can also be extended to personalize the exposure adjustments for a user and device. We improve the learning performance by incorporating an adaptive metering module that links semantics with exposure. This adaptive metering module generalizes the conventional spot or matrix metering techniques. We validate our system using the MIT FiveK and our own datasets captured using iPhone 7 and Google Pixel. Experimental results show that our system exhibits stable real-time behavior while improving visual quality compared to what is achieved through native camera control.",0
"Here we present our research on a novel framework that combines adaptive metering techniques with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to create personalized exposure control systems that can efficiently manage resources while minimizing waste and maximizing user satisfaction. By using RL algorithms to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on realtime feedback from end users, these systems can achieve significant improvements over traditional static approaches that rely exclusively on fixed rules and thresholds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive simulations across various scenarios and system configurations, showing that it consistently outperforms stateoftheart methods in terms of resource utilization, user experience, and overall efficiency. Our findings have important implications for a wide range of applications, including network management, energy conservation, manufacturing processes, and even gaming and entertainment platforms. Overall, this work represents an important step forward towards intelligent, autonomous, and highly responsive systems that can adapt in real time to changing environments, preferences, and constraints.",1
"Within the context of autonomous driving a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for the design of neural network-parameterized controllers. Classical model-based control methods, which include sampling- and lattice-based algorithms and model predictive control, suffer from the trade-off between model complexity and computational burden required for the online solution of expensive optimization or search problems at every short sampling time. To circumvent this trade-off, a 2-step procedure is motivated: first learning of a controller during offline training based on an arbitrarily complicated mathematical system model, before online fast feedforward evaluation of the trained controller. The contribution of this paper is the proposition of a simple gradient-free and model-based algorithm for deep reinforcement learning using task separation with hill climbing (TSHC). In particular, (i) simultaneous training on separate deterministic tasks with the purpose of encoding many motion primitives in a neural network, and (ii) the employment of maximally sparse rewards in combination with virtual velocity constraints (VVCs) in setpoint proximity are advocated.",0
"Abstract: This paper proposes a method for automating vehicles using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in combination with task separation and hill climbing. The proposed approach addresses the challenges associated with large state spaces, sparse rewards, and high dimensional actions that make many DRL algorithms difficult to apply to real world driving scenarios. We show how our method can effectively learn complex driving behaviors through several experiments on a variety of test environments. Our results indicate that the use of task separation combined with hill climbing improves both sample efficiency and final performance compared to other popular DRL methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).",1
"Uncertainty computation in deep learning is essential to design robust and reliable systems. Variational inference (VI) is a promising approach for such computation, but requires more effort to implement and execute compared to maximum-likelihood methods. In this paper, we propose new natural-gradient algorithms to reduce such efforts for Gaussian mean-field VI. Our algorithms can be implemented within the Adam optimizer by perturbing the network weights during gradient evaluations, and uncertainty estimates can be cheaply obtained by using the vector that adapts the learning rate. This requires lower memory, computation, and implementation effort than existing VI methods, while obtaining uncertainty estimates of comparable quality. Our empirical results confirm this and further suggest that the weight-perturbation in our algorithm could be useful for exploration in reinforcement learning and stochastic optimization.",0
"This paper introduces a new method called weight-perturbation that allows fast Bayesian deep learning using the popular optimizer Adabatch gradient descent (ADAM). By adding small random noise to weights during training, we can train models as if they were perturbed by observation noise without actually observing any data. Our experiments show that our method matches state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets while allowing efficient parallelization across multiple GPUs. Additionally, we demonstrate how to apply dropout regularization in this framework.  Fast and Scalable Bayesian Deep Learning by Weight-Perturbation in Adam: This paper presents a novel approach to performing fast and scalable Bayesian deep learning through the use of weight perturbations in the popular optimization algorithm ADAM. The addition of small amounts of random noise to model weights during training enables the simulation of observer noise, eliminating the need for actual data observations. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to existing methods, while enabling parallel processing across multiple GPUs. Furthermore, the authors provide an application of dropout regularization within their framework. Overall, these findings suggest that the weight-perturbation approach represents a promising advancement in the field of Bayesian deep learning.",1
"One of the challenges in model-based control of stochastic dynamical systems is that the state transition dynamics are involved, and it is not easy or efficient to make good-quality predictions of the states. Moreover, there are not many representational models for the majority of autonomous systems, as it is not easy to build a compact model that captures the entire dynamical subtleties and uncertainties. In this work, we present a hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model with local features to learn the dynamics of a micro-robotic system as well as two simpler examples, consisting of a stochastic mass-spring damper and a stochastic double inverted pendulum on a cart. The model is hierarchical since we assume non-stationary priors for the model parameters. These non-stationary priors make the model more flexible by imposing priors on the priors of the model. To solve the maximum likelihood (ML) problem for this hierarchical model, we use the variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, and enhance the procedure by introducing hidden target variables. The algorithm yields parsimonious model structures, and consistently provides fast and accurate predictions for all our examples involving large training and test sets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in learning stochastic dynamics, which makes it suitable for future use in a paradigm, such as model-based reinforcement learning, to compute optimal control policies in real time.",0
"This model has been developed to improve the accuracy of approximating stochastic dynamics from limited data by incorporating both local features and hierarchical bayesian linear regression methodologies. By utilizing the strengths of these approaches while addressing their limitations, we aimed to provide more accurate and robust predictions. Our proposed model was applied on two real datasets: one related to human movement prediction and another related to robotic manipulation tasks. We compared our results against state-of-the art methods and showed that our approach outperformed them. The work presented here contributes towards developing better motion planning algorithms which can take into account uncertainty and variability present in human movements. Additionally, it advances research in the field of using deep learning models for approximating complex systems with limited data availability.",1
"Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently received increasing attention for their ability to provide well-calibrated posterior uncertainties. However, model selection---even choosing the number of nodes---remains an open question. Recent work has proposed the use of a horseshoe prior over node pre-activations of a Bayesian neural network, which effectively turns off nodes that do not help explain the data. In this work, we propose several modeling and inference advances that consistently improve the compactness of the model learned while maintaining predictive performance, especially in smaller-sample settings including reinforcement learning.",0
"Structured variational learning has recently gained interest as a powerful tool for modeling complex probability distributions with flexible latent structures. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that enables structured variational inference for Bayesian neural networks with horseshoe priors, which have been shown to promote sparse solutions and improve uncertainty quantification. Our approach leverages recent advances in Stein variational gradient descent, allowing us to efficiently optimize evidence lower bounds that account for both data likelihood and prior regularization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on several challenging tasks across different domains, including image generation, regression, and classification problems. By comparing against state-of-the-art methods, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves superior performance while maintaining interpretability and scalability. Overall, this study highlights the potential benefits of combining horseshoe priors with structured variational inference techniques, offering valuable insights into developing principled machine learning models for real-world applications.",1
"Despite many advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation, performance drop due to distribution mismatch is often encountered in the real world. Recently, a few domain adaptation and active learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the performance drop. However, very little attention has been made toward leveraging information in videos which are naturally captured in most camera systems. In this work, we propose to leverage ""motion prior"" in videos for improving human segmentation in a weakly-supervised active learning setting. By extracting motion information using optical flow in videos, we can extract candidate foreground motion segments (referred to as motion prior) potentially corresponding to human segments. We propose to learn a memory-network-based policy model to select strong candidate segments (referred to as strong motion prior) through reinforcement learning. The selected segments have high precision and are directly used to finetune the model. In a newly collected surveillance camera dataset and a publicly available UrbanStreet dataset, our proposed method improves the performance of human segmentation across multiple scenes and modalities (i.e., RGB to Infrared (IR)). Last but not least, our method is empirically complementary to existing domain adaptation approaches such that additional performance gain is achieved by combining our weakly-supervised active learning approach with domain adaptation approaches.",0
"Title: ""Improving Human Segmentation in Video by Utilizing Motion Priors""  This research presents a methodology that leverages motion priors to enhance human segmentation in videos. While existing approaches have achieved promising results, they often struggle with handling complex scenarios where humans undergo significant appearance changes due to occlusions, cluttered backgrounds, and varying illumination conditions. Our approach addresses these limitations by incorporating temporal consistency into the segmentation process via learned motion cues. We propose a novel formulation that exploits both local contextual features as well as global motion patterns to predict reliable human masks over time. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenes involving large motions or occlusions. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework towards accurate and efficient human segmentation in video content.",1
"Self-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks can harness large amounts of cheap unlabeled data to train powerful feature representations. As surrogate task, we jointly address ordering of visual data in the spatial and temporal domain. The permutations of training samples, which are at the core of self-supervision by ordering, have so far been sampled randomly from a fixed preselected set. Based on deep reinforcement learning we propose a sampling policy that adapts to the state of the network, which is being trained. Therefore, new permutations are sampled according to their expected utility for updating the convolutional feature representation. Experimental evaluation on unsupervised and transfer learning tasks demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks for image and video classification and nearest neighbor retrieval.",0

"Today, the optimal performance of existing noise-suppression algorithms, both data-driven and those based on classic statistical methods, is range bound to specific levels of instantaneous input signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we present a new approach to improve the adaptivity of such algorithms enabling them to perform robustly across a wide range of input signal and noise types. Our methodology is based on the dynamic control of algorithmic parameters via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we model the noise-suppression module as a black box, requiring no knowledge of the algorithmic mechanics except a simple feedback from the output. We utilize this feedback as the reward signal for a reinforcement-learning agent that learns a policy to adapt the algorithmic parameters for every incoming audio frame (16 ms of data). Our preliminary results show that such a control mechanism can substantially increase the overall performance of the underlying noise-suppression algorithm; 42% and 16% improvements in output SNR and MSE, respectively, when compared to no adaptivity.",0
"""This paper proposes a novel approach to speech enhancement using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt the enhancer to changing input signal quality. In contrast to traditional methods that rely on handcrafted features and predefined models, our method learns to select parameters based on their impact on speech recognition performance.

Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in speech recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods under varying noise conditions. Additionally, we show that our approach can learn from scratch without any prior knowledge of audio processing techniques. Overall, these results suggest that our approach has great potential for use in real-world applications where speech enhancement must rapidly adapt to fluctuating noise environments.""",1
"We propose a new method for learning the structure of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that is more efficient than recent state-of-the-art methods based on reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. Our approach uses a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) strategy, in which we search for structures in order of increasing complexity, while simultaneously learning a surrogate model to guide the search through structure space. Direct comparison under the same search space shows that our method is up to 5 times more efficient than the RL method of Zoph et al. (2018) in terms of number of models evaluated, and 8 times faster in terms of total compute. The structures we discover in this way achieve state of the art classification accuracies on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.",0
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have been made possible by using neural network architectures that require large amounts of data and computational resources.

PNAS is a multi-objective approach that simultaneously searches for both accurate and efficient architectures. We use reinforcement learning techniques to train our model to select candidate architectures based on their ability to minimize error and maximize efficiency. Our results show that PNAS achieves comparable accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computation time and resource requirements. This makes PNAS a promising solution for real-world applications where inference speed is critical. Overall, our research contributes to the field of neural architecture search by proposing a progressive method for designing more interpretable and efficient models.",1
"Existing research studies on vision and language grounding for robot navigation focus on improving model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models in synthetic environments. However, model-free DRL models do not consider the dynamics in the real-world environments, and they often fail to generalize to new scenes. In this paper, we take a radical approach to bridge the gap between synthetic studies and real-world practices---We propose a novel, planned-ahead hybrid reinforcement learning model that combines model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to solve a real-world vision-language navigation task. Our look-ahead module tightly integrates a look-ahead policy model with an environment model that predicts the next state and the reward. Experimental results suggest that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines and achieves the best on the real-world Room-to-Room dataset. Moreover, our scalable method is more generalizable when transferring to unseen environments.",0

"Imitation learning algorithms can be used to learn a policy from expert demonstrations without access to a reward signal. However, most existing approaches are not applicable in multi-agent settings due to the existence of multiple (Nash) equilibria and non-stationary environments. We propose a new framework for multi-agent imitation learning for general Markov games, where we build upon a generalized notion of inverse reinforcement learning. We further introduce a practical multi-agent actor-critic algorithm with good empirical performance. Our method can be used to imitate complex behaviors in high-dimensional environments with multiple cooperative or competing agents.",0
"In Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (MGAIL), we propose a method that enables agents acting on different time scales to learn from each other by imitating successful behaviors. Our approach involves two key components: a generative model and a discriminator network. The generative model learns to generate sequences of actions that maximize the probability of succeeding at a task given the current state. The discriminator network evaluates whether these generated action sequences are likely to have been produced by an expert agent or simply randomly sampled. By training both networks together in a minimax game framework, MGAIL allows agents to selectively imitate expert behaviors while preserving their own unique strengths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across a range of domains, including robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing tasks, comparing against traditional imitation learning algorithms as well as state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. Our results show that MGAIL can improve performance over baseline methods while maintaining efficient computation timescales. Overall, MGAIL represents a promising new direction for multi-agent systems, allowing teams of agents to collaborate effectively even if they act at vastly differing speeds.",1
"State-action value functions (i.e., Q-values) are ubiquitous in reinforcement learning (RL), giving rise to popular algorithms such as SARSA and Q-learning. We propose a new notion of action value defined by a Gaussian smoothed version of the expected Q-value. We show that such smoothed Q-values still satisfy a Bellman equation, making them learnable from experience sampled from an environment. Moreover, the gradients of expected reward with respect to the mean and covariance of a parameterized Gaussian policy can be recovered from the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function. Based on these relationships, we develop new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy directly from a learned smoothed Q-value approximator. The approach is additionally amenable to proximal optimization by augmenting the objective with a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy. We find that the ability to learn both a mean and covariance during training leads to significantly improved results on standard continuous control benchmarks.",0
"A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is how to evaluate policies. One popular choice is action value functions that compare different actions taken from each state. However, naively trained action value functions can lead to poor policy evaluation since they suffer from high variance and sensitivity to starting points, leading to unstable training dynamics. To mitigate these issues, we propose using smoothed action value function estimates instead of raw values. Specifically, our method uses an ensemble of neural networks pretrained on Monte Carlo rollouts to approximate action values as a probability distribution over possible outcomes. We then use this distribution to compute weighted average expected rewards across all possible outcomes based on current policy predictions. This approach yields both better stability during training and improved performance on several benchmark tasks. Our contributions provide new insight into the effectiveness of using ensembles in RL beyond just improving sample efficiency. They open up future research directions for alternative ways of incorporating uncertainty quantification for more robust behavior in sequential decision making settings.",1
"We propose Object-oriented Neural Programming (OONP), a framework for semantically parsing documents in specific domains. Basically, OONP reads a document and parses it into a predesigned object-oriented data structure (referred to as ontology in this paper) that reflects the domain-specific semantics of the document. An OONP parser models semantic parsing as a decision process: a neural net-based Reader sequentially goes through the document, and during the process it builds and updates an intermediate ontology to summarize its partial understanding of the text it covers. OONP supports a rich family of operations (both symbolic and differentiable) for composing the ontology, and a big variety of forms (both symbolic and differentiable) for representing the state and the document. An OONP parser can be trained with supervision of different forms and strength, including supervised learning (SL) , reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid of the two. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world document parsing tasks have shown that OONP can learn to handle fairly complicated ontology with training data of modest sizes.",0
"Here’s an example of how you can write the abstract:  Neural networks have made significant progress in recent years on tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing, but they still struggle when applied to document understanding problems. One reason why neural models fall short in these cases could be their limited ability to explicitly represent objects and their relationships within documents. This article proposes object-oriented neural programming (OONP), a novel approach that enables neural networks to model complex object interactions by taking inspiration from object-oriented programming languages. Our method incorporates object instances and their attributes into neural networks while preserving their interpretability and explainability. Experimental results show the promise of our framework across three distinctive case studies for different types of documents. OONP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques at each task and provides detailed explanations of predictions through attention analysis. These findings suggest that OONP is a promising direction towards bridging the gap between human intelligence and artificial intelligence for intelligent applications in real-world scenarios.

"While deeper convolutional networks are needed to achieve maximum accuracy in visual perception tasks, for many inputs shallower networks are sufficient. We exploit this observation by learning to skip convolutional layers on a per-input basis. We introduce SkipNet, a modified residual network, that uses a gating network to selectively skip convolutional blocks based on the activations of the previous layer. We formulate the dynamic skipping problem in the context of sequential decision making and propose a hybrid learning algorithm that combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to address the challenges of non-differentiable skipping decisions. We show SkipNet reduces computation by 30-90% while preserving the accuracy of the original model on four benchmark datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art dynamic networks and static compression methods. We also qualitatively evaluate the gating policy to reveal a relationship between image scale and saliency and the number of layers skipped.",0
"SkipNet: Learning Dynamic Routing in Convolutional Networks presents a new architecture that uses dynamic routing operations between layers of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Unlike traditional static connections where weights are learned during training and fixed afterwards, our method learns which paths contribute more strongly to each output feature, and modifies their strength accordingly at inference time. We demonstrate on several benchmark datasets that this can yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art models while often using fewer parameters, even without relying on any explicit attention mechanism. Our design achieves these benefits by extending recent advances in non-local operators with trainable learnable parameters, and applying them to end-to-end optimize both accuracy as well as efficiency. We hope SkipNet may serve as inspiration for future progress on computer vision tasks, given how much faster our approach runs and yet still performs so competitively compared against other methods.",1
"In this article, we sketch an algorithm that extends the Q-learning algorithms to the continuous action space domain. Our method is based on the discretization of the action space.

We demonstrate through experiments that our approach improves over standard methods and scales better than prior continuous-action RL methods across several domains.",1
"Machine Learning models become increasingly proficient in complex tasks. However, even for experts in the field, it can be difficult to understand what the model learned. This hampers trust and acceptance, and it obstructs the possibility to correct the model. There is therefore a need for transparency of machine learning models. The development of transparent classification models has received much attention, but there are few developments for achieving transparent Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. In this study we propose a method that enables a RL agent to explain its behavior in terms of the expected consequences of state transitions and outcomes. First, we define a translation of states and actions to a description that is easier to understand for human users. Second, we developed a procedure that enables the agent to obtain the consequences of a single action, as well as its entire policy. The method calculates contrasts between the consequences of a policy derived from a user query, and of the learned policy of the agent. Third, a format for generating explanations was constructed. A pilot survey study was conducted to explore preferences of users for different explanation properties. Results indicate that human users tend to favor explanations about policy rather than about single actions.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to explainability in reinforcement learning (RL) based on contrastive explanations. Traditional RL algorithms optimize policies by maximizing expected rewards without providing any insight into how those decisions were made. In contrast, our method uses contrastive explanations that compare different policy options and their expected consequences before making a decision. These explanations allow humans to better understand why a certain action was chosen over others and make informed interventions if necessary. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in both simulated environments and real-world applications, showing significant improvements in performance compared to baseline models. Overall, our work represents an important step towards more transparent and interpretable RL systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a task. However, an agent that is trained using reinforcement learning is only capable of achieving the single task that is specified via its reward function. Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations. Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing. We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try to achieve, specified as goal states. The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difficulty for the agent. Our method thus automatically produces a curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn to perform a wide set of tasks without requiring any prior knowledge of its environment. Our method can also learn to achieve tasks with sparse rewards, which traditionally pose significant challenges.",0
"In this paper we present a novel approach to automatically generating goals for reinforcement learning agents. Our method leverages deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate diverse sets of high quality goals that are tailored to each agent’s current state. We show how these generated goals can be used to improve both policy performance and sample efficiency across a range of domains including Atari games and locomotion tasks. Importantly, our method requires no domain-specific tuning, making it a general solution that can be applied to any RL problem. Finally, we provide qualitative and quantitative analysis showing that the learned goals closely align with expert human preferences. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in enabling RL algorithms to learn more quickly and effectively by providing them with better quality goals.",1

"Deep neural network architectures have traditionally been designed and explored with human expertise in a long-lasting trial-and-error process. This process requires huge amount of time, expertise, and resources. To address this tedious problem, we propose a novel algorithm to optimally find hyperparameters of a deep network architecture automatically. We specifically focus on designing neural architectures for medical image segmentation task. Our proposed method is based on a policy gradient reinforcement learning for which the reward function is assigned a segmentation evaluation utility (i.e., dice index). We show the efficacy of the proposed method with its low computational cost in comparison with the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation networks. We also present a new architecture design, a densely connected encoder-decoder CNN, as a strong baseline architecture to apply the proposed hyperparameter search algorithm. We apply the proposed algorithm to each layer of the baseline architectures. As an application, we train the proposed system on cine cardiac MR images from Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) MICCAI 2017.

"The idea of reusing information from previously learned tasks (source tasks) for the learning of new tasks (target tasks) has the potential to significantly improve the sample efficiency reinforcement learning agents. In this work, we describe an approach to concisely store and represent learned task knowledge, and reuse it by allowing it to guide the exploration of an agent while it learns new tasks. In order to do so, we use a measure of similarity that is defined directly in the space of parameterized representations of the value functions. This similarity measure is also used as a basis for a variant of the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which is simultaneously used to enable the storage of previously acquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner.We empirically validate our approach in a simulated navigation environment and discuss possible extensions to this approach along with potential applications where it could be particularly useful.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using self-organizing maps (SOMs) as storage mechanisms and transfer learning techniques in reinforcement learning tasks. SOMs are unsupervised neural networks that can organize high-dimensional input data into lower dimensional representations called maps, which have been shown to capture relevant features and patterns from complex datasets.  In the context of reinforcement learning, SOMs can serve several purposes, such as storing learned experiences or state representation for later retrieval, facilitating generalization across similar states, and enabling efficient exploration by identifying important features. However, despite their potential advantages, the use of SOMs in reinforcement learning remains relatively understudied.  The aim of our work is to contribute towards filling this gap by investigating how SOMs can be used effectively as storage and transfer mechanisms in different types of RL problems. We present several experiments on classical control tasks, such as mountain car and cart pole balancing, and demonstrate promising results compared to conventional baseline methods. Our findings suggest that SOMs are capable of improving sample efficiency and performance in both episodic memory tasks and continuous-time domains.  Moreover, we investigate the underlying principles governing the use of SOMs in RL, including the impact of map size, neighborhood function choice, random initialization, training time, and more. We hope that our study provides insights into how researchers can design and deploy effective RL agents leveraging SOMs as fundamental components. By doing so, we expect that future developments in deep reinforcement learning may gain from these methodological advancements.",1
"In model-based reinforcement learning, generative and temporal models of environments can be leveraged to boost agent performance, either by tuning the agent's representations during training or via use as part of an explicit planning mechanism. However, their application in practice has been limited to simplistic environments, due to the difficulty of training such models in larger, potentially partially-observed and 3D environments. In this work we introduce a novel action-conditioned generative model of such challenging environments. The model features a non-parametric spatial memory system in which we store learned, disentangled representations of the environment. Low-dimensional spatial updates are computed using a state-space model that makes use of knowledge on the prior dynamics of the moving agent, and high-dimensional visual observations are modelled with a Variational Auto-Encoder. The result is a scalable architecture capable of performing coherent predictions over hundreds of time steps across a range of partially observed 2D and 3D environments.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, generative models have shown great promise in many applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. These models can learn complex relationships within data distributions by generating new instances that capture these underlying patterns. However, traditional generative models often struggle with partially observed environments where only partial observations of the true state are available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Generative Temporal Models with Spatial Memory (GTM-SM). GTM-SM builds upon the concept of memory mechanisms found in biological organisms to store and process spatial representations over time, allowing it to reason about past experiences when making predictions in partially observed situations. Our model achieves competitive performance on several benchmark tasks while providing interpretable explanations and robustness against noisy inputs.

"The growing prospect of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) being used in cyber-physical systems has raised concerns around safety and robustness of autonomous agents. Recent work on generating adversarial attacks have shown that it is computationally feasible for a bad actor to fool a DRL policy into behaving sub optimally. Although certain adversarial attacks with specific attack models have been addressed, most studies are only interested in off-line optimization in the data space (e.g., example fitting, distillation). This paper introduces a Meta-Learned Advantage Hierarchy (MLAH) framework that is attack model-agnostic and more suited to reinforcement learning, via handling the attacks in the decision space (as opposed to data space) and directly mitigating learned bias introduced by the adversary. In MLAH, we learn separate sub-policies (nominal and adversarial) in an online manner, as guided by a supervisory master agent that detects the presence of the adversary by leveraging the advantage function for the sub-policies. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables policy learning with significantly lower bias as compared to the state-of-the-art policy learning approaches even in the presence of heavy state information attacks. We present algorithm analysis and simulation results using popular OpenAI Gym environments.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to policy learning that allows agents to learn robust policies even if there are unknown adversaries present in their environment. Our method uses reinforcement learning techniques combined with graph theory and game theory principles to model and analyze the behavior of both the agent and potential adversaries. We demonstrate through simulations that our approach can significantly outperform traditional methods when faced with adversarial situations. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of our algorithm under certain conditions. Overall, our work shows promise in enabling agents to operate effectively in uncertain environments where they may encounter adversaries whose actions are not fully known.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved impressive success in many applications. A key component of many DRL models is a neural network representing a Q function, to estimate the expected cumulative reward following a state-action pair. The Q function neural network contains a lot of implicit knowledge about the RL problems, but often remains unexamined and uninterpreted. To our knowledge, this work develops the first mimic learning framework for Q functions in DRL. We introduce Linear Model U-trees (LMUTs) to approximate neural network predictions. An LMUT is learned using a novel on-line algorithm that is well-suited for an active play setting, where the mimic learner observes an ongoing interaction between the neural net and the environment. Empirical evaluation shows that an LMUT mimics a Q function substantially better than five baseline methods. The transparent tree structure of an LMUT facilitates understanding the network's learned knowledge by analyzing feature influence, extracting rules, and highlighting the super-pixels in image inputs.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful approach for training agents to perform complex tasks. However, due to their reliance on deep neural networks, these models can often be difficult to interpret and debug. To address this issue, we propose using linear model U-trees as an alternative architecture for DRL. This approach allows us to train interpretable policies that can provide insight into how an agent makes decisions. We evaluate our method across several domains and show that it leads to significant improvement over traditional DRL methods in terms of both performance and interpretability. Our results suggest that linear model U-trees offer a promising direction towards improving the explainability and transparency of modern machine learning systems.",1
"A variety of machine learning models have been proposed to assess the performance of players in professional sports. However, they have only a limited ability to model how player performance depends on the game context. This paper proposes a new approach to capturing game context: we apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to learn an action-value Q function from 3M play-by-play events in the National Hockey League (NHL). The neural network representation integrates both continuous context signals and game history, using a possession-based LSTM. The learned Q-function is used to value players' actions under different game contexts. To assess a player's overall performance, we introduce a novel Game Impact Metric (GIM) that aggregates the values of the player's actions. Empirical Evaluation shows GIM is consistent throughout a play season, and correlates highly with standard success measures and future salary.",0
"In this work we propose the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to evaluate ice hockey players' contextual performance. We define player evaluation as estimating how well each individual player performs their role on the team given the circumstances they encounter during a game. Our proposed approach uses DRL agents to learn from historical games played by each player in different situations: offensive zone entries, defending against rushes, power play opportunities, penalty killing attempts, etc. Each agent represents a specific situation encountered on the ice and learns to make evaluations based on player actions within that scenario. Our results show that our DRL models can effectively estimate player contributions in different contexts without requiring extensive manual feature engineering or expert knowledge of the sport. Additionally, we demonstrate the generality of our model by showing that it can accurately predict unseen data generated using random parameter values. This suggests that our methodology may have potential applications beyond just sports analytics. Finally, we discuss limitations and future directions for research in this area.",1
"Multi-task Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is the problem of inferring multiple reward functions from expert demonstrations. Prior work, built on Bayesian IRL, is unable to scale to complex environments due to computational constraints. This paper contributes a formulation of multi-task IRL in the more computationally efficient Maximum Causal Entropy (MCE) IRL framework. Experiments show our approach can perform one-shot imitation learning in a gridworld environment that single-task IRL algorithms need hundreds of demonstrations to solve. We outline preliminary work using meta-learning to extend our method to the function approximator setting of modern MCE IRL algorithms. Evaluating on multi-task variants of common simulated robotics benchmarks, we discover serious limitations of these IRL algorithms, and conclude with suggestions for further work.",0
"Abstract: Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MIIRL) is an iterative method that combines model free estimation with Bayesian decision theory to find the most plausible policy based on observed trajectories from expert demonstrations. However, traditional MIIRL suffers from high computational complexity, due to requiring separate iterations for each task, making scaling to large number of tasks difficult. This study presents multi-task maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MT-MIIRL), which extends single-task MIIRL by efficiently handling multiple related tasks with shared policies while exploiting their similarities and minimizing the computational cost.

"Deep reinforcement learning has recently shown many impressive successes. However, one major obstacle towards applying such methods to real-world problems is their lack of data-efficiency. To this end, we propose the Bottleneck Simulator: a model-based reinforcement learning method which combines a learned, factorized transition model of the environment with rollout simulations to learn an effective policy from few examples. The learned transition model employs an abstract, discrete (bottleneck) state, which increases sample efficiency by reducing the number of model parameters and by exploiting structural properties of the environment. We provide a mathematical analysis of the Bottleneck Simulator in terms of fixed points of the learned policy, which reveals how performance is affected by four distinct sources of error: an error related to the abstract space structure, an error related to the transition model estimation variance, an error related to the transition model estimation bias, and an error related to the transition model class bias. Finally, we evaluate the Bottleneck Simulator on two natural language processing tasks: a text adventure game and a real-world, complex dialogue response selection task. On both tasks, the Bottleneck Simulator yields excellent performance beating competing approaches.",0
"The Bottleneck Simulator is a new approach that combines model-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) with simulated environments to address many of the issues faced by traditional RL methods. By using models to represent the environment and predict future states, the agent can plan more effectively and make better decisions. Additionally, the use of simulation allows for faster and safer experimentation without the need for real-world interactions. Our experiments show promising results across several domains, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, we believe that the Bottleneck Simulator has great potential as a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents capable of solving complex tasks in uncertain and dynamic environments.",1
"The present work extends the randomized shortest-paths framework (RSP), interpolating between shortest-path and random-walk routing in a network, in three directions. First, it shows how to deal with equality constraints on a subset of transition probabilities and develops a generic algorithm for solving this constrained RSP problem using Lagrangian duality. Second, it derives a surprisingly simple iterative procedure to compute the optimal, randomized, routing policy generalizing the previously developed ""soft"" Bellman-Ford algorithm. The resulting algorithm allows balancing exploitation and exploration in an optimal way by interpolating between a pure random behavior and the deterministic, optimal, policy (least-cost paths) while satisfying the constraints. Finally, the two algorithms are applied to Markov decision problems by considering the process as a constrained RSP on a bipartite state-action graph. In this context, the derived ""soft"" value iteration algorithm appears to be closely related to dynamic policy programming as well as Kullback-Leibler and path integral control, and similar to a recently introduced reinforcement learning exploration strategy. This shows that this strategy is optimal in the RSP sense - it minimizes expected path cost subject to relative entropy constraint. Simulation results on illustrative examples show that the model behaves as expected.",0
"This work presents A Constrained Randomized Shortest-Paths (CRSP) framework for optimal exploration under uncertainty. We consider two applications: mobile robot navigation where the goal is to maximize data collection without revisiting previously visited locations, and sensor placement planning where sensors are placed optimally based on communication constraints. The CRSP algorithm uses a variant of Rapidly Expanding Random Trees (RRT) that ensures connectivity while satisfying distance constraints by using minimum spanning trees. The approach uses mixed integer linear programming techniques to optimize the tree configurations by minimizing path lengths subject to the distance constraint. Simulation results demonstrate significant reduction in travel distance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show how our framework can perform better than traditional RRT algorithms, especially as problem complexity increases. Overall, this research proposes a novel optimization technique for complex exploration problems, enabling more efficient mission completion in real world scenarios such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue operations, and planetary surface navigation.

"An important property for lifelong-learning agents is the ability to combine existing skills to solve unseen tasks. In general, however, it is unclear how to compose skills in a principled way. We provide a ""recipe"" for optimal value function composition in entropy-regularised reinforcement learning (RL) and then extend this to the standard RL setting. Composition is demonstrated in a video game environment, where an agent with an existing library of policies is able to solve new tasks without the need for further learning.",0
"In this paper we explore how value functions can improve RL algorithms by guiding their exploration towards high reward regions of state space. We first discuss different ways to compose new features from existing ones that have been learnt through interactions with the environment. These features enable new policies to maximize total reward. Then we evaluate our framework on two benchmark problems - mountain car and lunar lander. Our approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art models in both tasks. Overall, we show how value functions provide powerful tools to improve learning outcomes in challenging domains where classical methods struggle.",1
"We introduce a deep generative model for functions. Our model provides a joint distribution p(f, z) over functions f and latent variables z which lets us efficiently sample from the marginal p(f) and maximize a variational lower bound on the entropy H(f). We can thus maximize objectives of the form E_{f~p(f)}[R(f)] + c*H(f), where R(f) denotes, e.g., a data log-likelihood term or an expected reward. Such objectives encompass Bayesian deep learning in function space, rather than parameter space, and Bayesian deep RL with representations of uncertainty that offer benefits over bootstrapping and parameter noise. In this short paper we describe our model, situate it in the context of prior work, and present proof-of-concept experiments for regression and RL.",0
"This is a deep generative model which generates code by taking a natural language prompt as input and outputting code that executes functions according to the prompt.  Its structure is based on transformers but has many innovations such as the incorporation of programmatic operators like if-else statements etc. In addition the authors have developed two new evaluation metrics - one designed to measure the semantic correctness (truth value) of generated programs against those handwritten by humans (Human Eval metric), another measuring how faithfully generated programs adhere to their target specification written using natural language (Faithful Eval metric). They present extensive empirical results showing substantially better performance over previous works and demonstrate capabilities across many problem domains including text classification, symbolic regression, OCR, program synthesis and more. Overall this work represents a major advance toward realizing general function synthesis from natural language descriptions.",1
"Autonomous urban driving navigation with complex multi-agent dynamics is under-explored due to the difficulty of learning an optimal driving policy. The traditional modular pipeline heavily relies on hand-designed rules and the pre-processing perception system while the supervised learning-based models are limited by the accessibility of extensive human experience. We present a general and principled Controllable Imitative Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) approach which successfully makes the driving agent achieve higher success rates based on only vision inputs in a high-fidelity car simulator. To alleviate the low exploration efficiency for large continuous action space that often prohibits the use of classical RL on challenging real tasks, our CIRL explores over a reasonably constrained action space guided by encoded experiences that imitate human demonstrations, building upon Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Moreover, we propose to specialize adaptive policies and steering-angle reward designs for different control signals (i.e. follow, straight, turn right, turn left) based on the shared representations to improve the model capability in tackling with diverse cases. Extensive experiments on CARLA driving benchmark demonstrate that CIRL substantially outperforms all previous methods in terms of the percentage of successfully completed episodes on a variety of goal-directed driving tasks. We also show its superior generalization capability in unseen environments. To our knowledge, this is the first successful case of the learned driving policy through reinforcement learning in the high-fidelity simulator, which performs better-than supervised imitation learning.",0
"CIRL stands for Controllable Imitative Reinforcement Learning. The purpose of CIRL is to develop a system for vision-based self-driving cars that can learn from human drivers while still retaining control over safety-critical decisions. This would allow the vehicle to improve its performance through machine learning without compromising passenger safety. CIRL uses imitation learning as a means to teach the car how to drive like a human driver by observing and replicating their actions. By doing so, the vehicle can learn from both successful and unsuccessful examples of driving, allowing it to adapt to different road conditions and situations. Additionally, a reinforcement signal provided by humans allows for fine-grained control over which behaviors should be encouraged or discouraged during training. Overall, CIRL provides a promising approach towards developing safer and more efficient autonomous vehicles.",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Q-learning, directly parameterize and update value functions or policies without explicitly modeling the environment. They are typically simpler, more flexible to use, and thus more prevalent in modern deep RL than model-based approaches. However, empirical work has suggested that model-free algorithms may require more samples to learn [Deisenroth and Rasmussen 2011, Schulman et al. 2015]. The theoretical question of ""whether model-free algorithms can be made sample efficient"" is one of the most fundamental questions in RL, and remains unsolved even in the basic scenario with finitely many states and actions.   We prove that, in an episodic MDP setting, Q-learning with UCB exploration achieves regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{H^3 SAT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, $H$ is the number of steps per episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps. This sample efficiency matches the optimal regret that can be achieved by any model-based approach, up to a single $\sqrt{H}$ factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the model-free setting that establishes $\sqrt{T}$ regret without requiring access to a ""simulator.""",0
"This paper presents theoretical evidence that Q-learning is provably efficient under certain conditions on Markov decision processes (MDPs). We show that Q-learning converges faster than any other online algorithm whose running time depends only on the stepsize parameter and does not depend on the MDP parameters. Our proof uses a drift condition similar to those used in the literature for the convergence analysis of offline reinforcement learning algorithms and dynamic programming methods. We demonstrate our results using several numerical experiments on randomly generated MDPs and discuss their implications for both theory and practice. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of Q-learning as a popular and widely adopted RL algorithm.",1
"Model-based compression is an effective, facilitating, and expanded model of neural network models with limited computing and low power.

This paper will effectively analyze deep auto compression (ADC) and reinforcement learning strength in an effective sample and space design, and improve the compression quality of the model. The results of compression of the advanced model are obtained without any human effort and in a completely automated way. With a 4- fold reduction in FLOP, the accuracy of 2.8% is higher than the manual compression model for VGG-16 in ImageNet.",0

"Learning a generative model is a key component of model-based reinforcement learning. Though learning a good model in the tabular setting is a simple task, learning a useful model in the approximate setting is challenging. In this context, an important question is the loss function used for model learning as varying the loss function can have a remarkable impact on effectiveness of planning. Recently Farahmand et al. (2017) proposed a value-aware model learning (VAML) objective that captures the structure of value function during model learning. Using tools from Asadi et al. (2018), we show that minimizing the VAML objective is in fact equivalent to minimizing the Wasserstein metric. This equivalence improves our understanding of value-aware models, and also creates a theoretical foundation for applications of Wasserstein in model-based reinforcement~learning.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), policy gradient methods use parameterized policies that are updated by ascending their value functions: estimators of expected discounted cumulative reward obtained under each policy. To obtain these value estimates, two families of objectives have gained popularity: the temporal difference (TD) loss, which estimates the one-step TD error; and the model-free RL objective, which directly estimates the state-action values (q-values). Recently, several works showed how to apply such objectives to model-based RL using linear function approximation, where the transition probabilities and rewards are unknown and must be learned through interactions. For example, we can formulate this problem as minimizing J(theta)=E_mu[G^2+alpha*ln|det(lambda+Hesigma)|],where G is the Bellman residual, lambda and H are estimated from data, mu is the current policy, alpha>0 ensures convergence to local minima, the absolute continuity constraint of the estimated measure ensures non-zero initial states, E_mu is taken over trajectories sampled from the distribution induced by mu, and det() denotes matrix determinant. We can then show that if q is twice differentiable and satisfies J_{pi}(r)=E_p[\int Tdelta]<infinity,then q=v(x)+betaT+etaVpi+(Q*(1+T)(Q^{-1}*eta)^-1)*(Q*beta/dt + r - Q*(x) - Q*v(x)) and v is a fixed point solution of the Bellman equation. Here, beta and eta are parameters of our estimate q, V = [sigma(s1),...,sigma(sn)] is the feature expectation operator, x=[z';ones(n)]; zi~N(\hat{mean}_Z(z);Var_Z(z)), where N(*) is a standard normal density function, means and variances can depend on both Z and X.",1
"Existing person re-identification (re-id) methods assume the provision of accurately cropped person bounding boxes with minimum background noise, mostly by manually cropping. This is significantly breached in practice when person bounding boxes must be detected automatically given a very large number of images and/or videos processed. Compared to carefully cropped manually, auto-detected bounding boxes are far less accurate with random amount of background clutter which can degrade notably person re-id matching accuracy. In this work, we develop a joint learning deep model that optimises person re-id attention selection within any auto-detected person bounding boxes by reinforcement learning of background clutter minimisation subject to re-id label pairwise constraints. Specifically, we formulate a novel unified re-id architecture called Identity DiscriminativE Attention reinforcement Learning (IDEAL) to accurately select re-id attention in auto-detected bounding boxes for optimising re-id performance. Our model can improve re-id accuracy comparable to that from exhaustive human manual cropping of bounding boxes with additional advantages from identity discriminative attention selection that specially benefits re-id tasks beyond human knowledge. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the re-id advantages of the proposed IDEAL model over a wide range of state-of-the-art re-id methods on two auto-detected re-id benchmarks CUHK03 and Market-1501.",0
"Reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to provide good results on several challenging computer vision tasks such as object recognition and image generation. However, applying these methods to person re-identification (reID) remains difficult due to the lack of clear task definitions and suitable reward functions. This work presents a novel method for selecting relevant regions in images using deep reinforcement learning and attention selection to improve reID performance. We design a framework that can effectively learn discriminative representations by jointly optimizing feature extraction and attentional mechanisms towards the desired output. Our approach uses two key components: a convolutional neural network (CNN) that generates regional features from pedestrian images, and a policy network that selects discriminative subregions based on learned attentive weights. During training, we use binary cross entropy loss for supervised fine-tuning of both networks while maximizing the mutual information between selected regions and true identities. To evaluate our method’s effectiveness, extensive experiments were conducted on four public datasets, including CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMCross, and MSMT17. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving average rank 1 accuracy improvement ranging from 2% to 9%. Furthermore, visualization analysis shows that attended regions typically focus on discriminative body parts that are robust under changes in viewpoint, illumination, pose, and background. Overall, our proposed method provides a principled way to incorporate attentional mechanisms into deep reID models for improved performance and interpretability.",1
"Learning from small data sets is critical in many practical applications where data collection is time consuming or expensive, e.g., robotics, animal experiments or drug design. Meta learning is one way to increase the data efficiency of learning algorithms by generalizing learned concepts from a set of training tasks to unseen, but related, tasks. Often, this relationship between tasks is hard coded or relies in some other way on human expertise. In this paper, we frame meta learning as a hierarchical latent variable model and infer the relationship between tasks automatically from data. We apply our framework in a model-based reinforcement learning setting and show that our meta-learning model effectively generalizes to novel tasks by identifying how new tasks relate to prior ones from minimal data. This results in up to a 60% reduction in the average interaction time needed to solve tasks compared to strong baselines.",0
"This is my attempt at writing such an abstract:  ---  In recent years, meta reinforcement learning (meta RL) has emerged as a promising approach for improving sample efficiency by enabling agents to learn from experiences across multiple tasks, reducing the number of interactions required to solve each task individually. However, existing methods often assume access to task-specific information that may not always be available, leading to suboptimal performance on new tasks. In this work, we present a novel method for meta RL based on latent variable Gaussian processes (LVGPs), which can capture complex relationships between tasks while leveraging unobserved variables that improve generalization to previously unseen tasks. We demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on a suite of continuous control benchmark tasks, including both discrete action spaces and function approximation architectures, under different levels of task similarity and shifts. Our results highlight the potential of LVGP models as a powerful tool for efficient cross-task adaptation in meta RL.",1
"We introduce SCAL, an algorithm designed to perform efficient exploration-exploitation in any unknown weakly-communicating Markov decision process (MDP) for which an upper bound $c$ on the span of the optimal bias function is known. For an MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions and $\Gamma \leq S$ possible next states, we prove a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(c\sqrt{\Gamma SAT})$, which significantly improves over existing algorithms (e.g., UCRL and PSRL), whose regret scales linearly with the MDP diameter $D$. In fact, the optimal bias span is finite and often much smaller than $D$ (e.g., $D=\infty$ in non-communicating MDPs). A similar result was originally derived by Bartlett and Tewari (2009) for REGAL.C, for which no tractable algorithm is available. In this paper, we relax the optimization problem at the core of REGAL.C, we carefully analyze its properties, and we provide the first computationally efficient algorithm to solve it. Finally, we report numerical simulations supporting our theoretical findings and showing how SCAL significantly outperforms UCRL in MDPs with large diameter and small span.",0
"This paper presents an approach to balance exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing bias spans that control how far actions deviate from optimal solutions. The proposed method enables efficient tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation based on current uncertainty levels and performance gaps.

Implications extend beyond RL and into other domains where managing exploration-exploitation dilemmas arises.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced greatly in the past few years with the employment of effective deep neural networks (DNNs) on the policy networks. With the great effectiveness came serious vulnerability issues with DNNs that small adversarial perturbations on the input can change the output of the network. Several works have pointed out that learned agents with a DNN policy network can be manipulated against achieving the original task through a sequence of small perturbations on the input states. In this paper, we demonstrate furthermore that it is also possible to impose an arbitrary adversarial reward on the victim policy network through a sequence of attacks. Our method involves the latest adversarial attack technique, Adversarial Transformer Network (ATN), that learns to generate the attack and is easy to integrate into the policy network. As a result of our attack, the victim agent is misguided to optimise for the adversarial reward over time. Our results expose serious security threats for RL applications in safety-critical systems including drones, medical analysis, and self-driving cars.",0
"Title: ""Long-term Adversarial Strategies Against Intelligent Agents""  Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, intelligent agents must operate in environments where they may face adversaries who seek to prevent them from achieving their goals. These adversaries often have access to incomplete information about the agent's intentions and capabilities, but can still adapt their strategies over time to better counter the agent's efforts. This work examines how such sequential attacks can be designed and executed by an adversary to thwart the agent's long-term objectives. We propose a framework for analyzing these attacks and present case studies demonstrating how our approach can effectively disrupt the agent's plans. Our results highlight the importance of considering adversarial behavior when designing and deploying intelligent agents in complex and dynamic environments.",1
"Exploration is a difficult challenge in reinforcement learning and even recent state-of-the art curiosity-based methods rely on the simple epsilon-greedy strategy to generate novelty. We argue that pure random walks do not succeed to properly expand the exploration area in most environments and propose to replace single random action choices by random goals selection followed by several steps in their direction. This approach is compatible with any curiosity-based exploration and off-policy reinforcement learning agents and generates longer and safer trajectories than individual random actions. To illustrate this, we present a task-independent agent that learns to reach coordinates in screen frames and demonstrate its ability to explore with the game Super Mario Bros. improving significantly the score of a baseline DQN agent.",0

"In reinforcement learning, it is common to let an agent interact for a fixed amount of time with its environment before resetting it and repeating the process in a series of episodes. The task that the agent has to learn can either be to maximize its performance over (i) that fixed period, or (ii) an indefinite period where time limits are only used during training to diversify experience. In this paper, we provide a formal account for how time limits could effectively be handled in each of the two cases and explain why not doing so can cause state-aliasing and invalidation of experience replay, leading to suboptimal policies and training instability. In case (i), we argue that the terminations due to time limits are in fact part of the environment, and thus a notion of the remaining time should be included as part of the agent's input to avoid violation of the Markov property. In case (ii), the time limits are not part of the environment and are only used to facilitate learning. We argue that this insight should be incorporated by bootstrapping from the value of the state at the end of each partial episode. For both cases, we illustrate empirically the significance of our considerations in improving the performance and stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms, showing state-of-the-art results on several control tasks.",0
"Abstract: This study aimed to investigate whether time limits can improve performance in reinforcement learning tasks. Our results showed that adding a time limit improved both speed and accuracy, but only up until a certain point where further improvements plateaued. These findings suggest that there may be optimal time limits for different types of tasks, and that future research should examine how time limits interact with other aspects of RL algorithms such as exploration strategies and reward functions. Overall, our work contributes to ongoing efforts to better understand the mechanisms behind human decision making and the use of time constraints as a tool to improve learning outcomes.",1

"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been applied to model gameplay with great success, achieving super-human performance in various environments, such as Atari, Go, and Poker. However, those studies mostly focus on winning the game and have largely ignored the rich and complex human motivations, which are essential for understanding different players' diverse behaviors. In this paper, we present a novel method called Multi-Motivation Behavior Modeling (MMBM) that takes the multifaceted human motivations into consideration and models the underlying value structure of the players using inverse RL. Our approach does not require the access to the dynamic of the system, making it feasible to model complex interactive environments such as massively multiplayer online games. MMBM is tested on the World of Warcraft Avatar History dataset, which recorded over 70,000 users' gameplay spanning three years period.

This study aimed to expand upon previous work by incorporating a wider range of human motivations beyond just winning and losing. We used real-world datasets from domains such as finance, healthcare, and education to test our methodology. Our results showed that by considering additional factors like social influence, risk attitudes, and altruism, we were able to improve prediction accuracy and gain insights into why individuals choose certain actions over others. These findings have implications for applications such as personalized recommendation systems, decision support tools, and autonomous agents that interact with humans. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of IRL to advance our understanding of human behavior and decision making.",1
"Consistently checking the statistical significance of experimental results is one of the mandatory methodological steps to address the so-called ""reproducibility crisis"" in deep reinforcement learning. In this tutorial paper, we explain how the number of random seeds relates to the probabilities of statistical errors. For both the t-test and the bootstrap confidence interval test, we recall theoretical guidelines to determine the number of random seeds one should use to provide a statistically significant comparison of the performance of two algorithms. Finally, we discuss the influence of deviations from the assumptions usually made by statistical tests. We show that they can lead to inaccurate evaluations of statistical errors and provide guidelines to counter these negative effects. We make our code available to perform the tests.",0
"Abstract: In this paper we investigate how many random seeds should be used when conducting statistical power analysis in deep reinforcement learning experiments (RLL). We find that increasing the number of random seeds used can increase statistical power but at the cost of increased computational time and resources required. Using simulation studies and real world applications, we demonstrate optimal settings for different types of RL experiments. Our findings have important implications for future research on random seeds, particularly those in the field of machine learning where experimental design guidelines are still evolving.

"Multi-step temporal difference (TD) learning is an important approach in reinforcement learning, as it unifies one-step TD learning with Monte Carlo methods in a way where intermediate algorithms can outperform either extreme. They address a bias-variance trade off between reliance on current estimates, which could be poor, and incorporating longer sampled reward sequences into the updates. Especially in the off-policy setting, where the agent aims to learn about a policy different from the one generating its behaviour, the variance in the updates can cause learning to diverge as the number of sampled rewards used in the estimates increases. In this paper, we introduce per-decision control variates for multi-step TD algorithms, and compare them to existing methods. Our results show that including the control variates can greatly improve performance on both on and off-policy multi-step temporal difference learning tasks.",0
"Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in using machine learning techniques for solving sequential decision making problems. Most existing methods suffer from several drawbacks such as sample inefficiency, instability caused by high variance gradient estimates, and reliance on bootstrapping procedures which can introduce approximation errors. This study proposes Per-Decision Multi-Step Temporal Difference (TD) Learning with Control Variates, a novel framework that addresses these limitations while providing theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions. Our method employs per-decision learning rates which allow us to incorporate both the state visitation frequency and TD error into each update step, resulting in more stable convergence properties than traditional multi-step temporal difference methods. Additionally, we utilize control variates computed via Monte Carlo rollouts to reduce variance in the estimators without requiring any additional sampling overhead. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments on continuous and discrete action spaces that our proposed algorithm achieves substantially better performance compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both regret minimization and computational efficiency. Our findings have important implications for researchers studying reinforcement learning and other related fields where efficient solution methods for complex sequential decision making problems are required.",1
"Modern deep learning methods are very sensitive to many hyperparameters, and, due to the long training times of state-of-the-art models, vanilla Bayesian hyperparameter optimization is typically computationally infeasible. On the other hand, bandit-based configuration evaluation approaches based on random search lack guidance and do not converge to the best configurations as quickly. Here, we propose to combine the benefits of both Bayesian optimization and bandit-based methods, in order to achieve the best of both worlds: strong anytime performance and fast convergence to optimal configurations. We propose a new practical state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization method, which consistently outperforms both Bayesian optimization and Hyperband on a wide range of problem types, including high-dimensional toy functions, support vector machines, feed-forward neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, and convolutional neural networks. Our method is robust and versatile, while at the same time being conceptually simple and easy to implement.",0
"This could potentially be published so please keep it professional BOHB (short for ""Batch-constrained Optimal Hypothesis Batch"") is an algorithm designed specifically to optimize hyperparameters efficiently and effectively on large datasets. Unlike traditional methods, which tend to either be slow or require many resources, BOHB leverages recent advances in randomized optimization techniques combined with modern high-performance computing capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art results while saving time and computational power. In addition to these technical innovations, our proposed methodology includes several unique features that set it apart from other approaches in the field. These include: (1) robustness against noisy gradients; (2) efficient handling of large-scale problems using mini-batch gradient descent; (3) support for constraints over batch dimensions to prevent unintended side effects such as mode collapse or data imbalance; and (4) explicit consideration of problem difficulty through the introduction of a novel acquisition function motivated by PAC Bayesian theory. We compare our approach to numerous baseline algorithms across diverse tasks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning, demonstrating significant improvements in both speed and accuracy under real-world scenarios. Overall, we believe our contributions have important implications for any application where automated tuning plays a crucial role, ranging from machine learning research to industry applications requiring rapid model deployment.",1
"A key question in Reinforcement Learning is which representation an agent can learn to efficiently reuse knowledge between different tasks. Recently the Successor Representation was shown to have empirical benefits for transferring knowledge between tasks with shared transition dynamics. This paper presents Model Features: a feature representation that clusters behaviourally equivalent states and that is equivalent to a Model-Reduction. Further, we present a Successor Feature model which shows that learning Successor Features is equivalent to learning a Model-Reduction. A novel optimization objective is developed and we provide bounds showing that minimizing this objective results in an increasingly improved approximation of a Model-Reduction. Further, we provide transfer experiments on randomly generated MDPs which vary in their transition and reward functions but approximately preserve behavioural equivalence between states. These results demonstrate that Model Features are suitable for transfer between tasks with varying transition and reward functions.",0
"Imitation learning has been shown to effectively transfer knowledge from one task to another by directly using policies trained on source tasks to guide action selection in target tasks without additional training. However, current methods that use imitation learning do so without exploiting the expressive power of deep neural network function approximation for optimal control problems. We introduce model features which can be used as extra state representations for more effective policy transfer through planning or model-based RL. Our approach decouples learned state representation from value functions, providing new degrees of freedom for guiding planning. Furthermore, our method allows us to train agents on fewer domains but still perform well across many other diverse unseen ones: we outperform prior work in most benchmarks by over +20% average human normalized score. Finally, due to the generality of our algorithm beyond model-free RL and offline imitation learning, we expect it to have widespread impact and be a central component of future multi-task AI systems.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has led to several recent breakthroughs, though the learned policies are often based on black-box neural networks. This makes them difficult to interpret and to impose desired specification constraints during learning. We present an iterative framework, MORL, for improving the learned policies using program synthesis. Concretely, we propose to use synthesis techniques to obtain a symbolic representation of the learned policy, which can then be debugged manually or automatically using program repair. After the repair step, we use behavior cloning to obtain the policy corresponding to the repaired program, which is then further improved using gradient descent. This process continues until the learned policy satisfies desired constraints. We instantiate MORL for the simple CartPole problem and show that the programmatic representation allows for high-level modifications that in turn lead to improved learning of the policies.",0
"This research addresses the challenge of optimizing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In RL, agents learn by interacting with their environment, receiving rewards for desired behaviors. While traditional methods have focused on continuous actions, recent work has explored program synthesis techniques which generate discrete action sequences that map to code snippets. These approaches can provide improved performance but often suffer from scalability issues due to the use of exact numerical methods such as CPLEX solvers.  We propose a novel approach called ""mixed optimization"" that combines both continuous and discrete search spaces, resulting in improved scalability without sacrificing optimal solutions. Our method uses a hierarchical decomposition scheme that separates high-level decisions from low-level ones while maintaining connectivity among all variables. We apply our technique to two well-known benchmarks, Acrobot and Mountain Car, demonstrating significant speedup over state-of-the-art MILP baselines.  Our results showcase the potential benefits of mixed optimization for RL tasks involving program synthesis. By balancing between continuous and discrete representations, we enable more efficient model training, leading to better policies across various domains. Furthermore, our framework offers flexibility through various relaxation levels that trade off solution quality versus computational resources. Overall, our contributions pave the way towards faster, accurate optimization methods for challenging problems within RL with program synthesis.",1
"Recent progress in artificial intelligence through reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success on increasingly complex single-agent environments and two-player turn-based games. However, the real-world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents, and environments reflecting this degree of complexity remain an open challenge. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that an agent can achieve human-level in a popular 3D multiplayer first-person video game, Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, using only pixels and game points as input. These results were achieved by a novel two-tier optimisation process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches with agents playing in teams together and against each other on randomly generated environments. Each agent in the population learns its own internal reward signal to complement the sparse delayed reward from winning, and selects actions using a novel temporally hierarchical representation that enables the agent to reason at multiple timescales. During game-play, these agents display human-like behaviours such as navigating, following, and defending based on a rich learned representation that is shown to encode high-level game knowledge. In an extensive tournament-style evaluation the trained agents exceeded the win-rate of strong human players both as teammates and opponents, and proved far stronger than existing state-of-the-art agents. These results demonstrate a significant jump in the capabilities of artificial agents, bringing us closer to the goal of human-level intelligence.",0
"This should give me: a general idea what the paper is about; why anyone would want such human level perfomance from agents in computer games and perhaps some idea how the authors achieved such impressive results? The research described in the paper demonstrates how advances in artificial intelligence can lead to virtual agents that perform at or near human levels on complex tasks. Specifically, we show that population-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms can learn to play difficult first-person shooter games like Quake III Arena at superhuman skill levels. These results have important implications for both game development and scientific inquiry into artificial intelligence more broadly, as they suggest that intelligent machines may one day be capable of surpassing human performance across a wide range of domains. Our approach combines traditional deep reinforcement learning techniques with novel methods inspired by evolutionary biology, allowing the agent to rapidly improve over time through repeated iterations of trial-and-error. By training multiple independent agents within each generation, our method leverages their collective knowledge and experience to inform subsequent search spaces, leading to improved overall performance. Through rigorous testing against human opponents, we demonstrate that these algorithms can effectively close the gap between machine and human performance in real-time decision making scenarios. Overall, this work represents a significant step towards creating intelligent systems that can function at or beyond human capacity in a variety of challenging environments.",1

"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for artificial intelligence, allowing agents to learn complex tasks through trial and error by maximizing their cumulative reward. However, understanding the relationship between exploration strategies and performance remains crucial for guiding both theoretical research and practical applications. This study investigates the potential of exploiting the return distribution to inform efficient exploration policies in RL. By analyzing a wide range of popular algorithms, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of the distribution over returns can significantly improve sample efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods on several challenging benchmarks. Our findings highlight the importance of considering different sources of uncertainty and provide insights into developing effective exploration strategies.

"We introduce a conceptually simple and scalable framework for continual learning domains where tasks are learned sequentially. Our method is constant in the number of parameters and is designed to preserve performance on previously encountered tasks while accelerating learning progress on subsequent problems. This is achieved by training a network with two components: A knowledge base, capable of solving previously encountered problems, which is connected to an active column that is employed to efficiently learn the current task. After learning a new task, the active column is distilled into the knowledge base, taking care to protect any previously acquired skills. This cycle of active learning (progression) followed by consolidation (compression) requires no architecture growth, no access to or storing of previous data or tasks, and no task-specific parameters. We demonstrate the progress & compress approach on sequential classification of handwritten alphabets as well as two reinforcement learning domains: Atari games and 3D maze navigation.",0
"Here we present Progress & Compress (P&C), a novel framework that enables efficient continual learning for large language models by leveraging progressive fine-tuning and weight quantization. By building upon prior work on neural architecture search and adapting architectures for compression, P&C balances model accuracy and storage requirements to enable ongoing training without overwhelming computational resources. Our method introduces two key components, a differentiable adder module for quantized gradients during inference, as well as progressive warm starting of pretrained checkpoints during adaptation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines using fewer GPU days and less memory during both initial training and incremental updates. Code and data will be released publicly.",1
"The use of ensembles of neural networks (NNs) for the quantification of predictive uncertainty is widespread. However, the current justification is intuitive rather than analytical. This work proposes one minor modification to the normal ensembling methodology, which we prove allows the ensemble to perform Bayesian inference, hence converging to the corresponding Gaussian Process as both the total number of NNs, and the size of each, tend to infinity. This working paper provides early-stage results in a reinforcement learning setting, analysing the practicality of the technique for an ensemble of small, finite number. Using the uncertainty estimates produced by anchored ensembles to govern the exploration-exploitation process results in steadier, more stable learning.",0
"This paper presents a new method for Bayesian inference using anchored ensembles of neural networks. We show that by combining multiple neural network models trained on different subsets of data, we can improve the accuracy and uncertainty estimates of our predictions. Our approach is based on the concept of anchoring, which involves specifying prior beliefs about the model parameters that are then updated through exposure to more data.  Our framework is designed to provide principled uncertainty quantification, allowing us to infer the epistemic uncertainty associated with each prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark datasets from diverse domains: a synthetic dataset consisting of randomly generated functions with additive noise, and a real-world dataset comprising human motion capture data.  Moreover, we explore how our anchored ensemble method can aid exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) settings where agents face large state spaces with unknown dynamics. We propose a novel RL algorithm called ""Thompson Sampling Ensemble"" that leverages the advantages of both Thompson sampling and Q-learning while employing an ensemble of learned value function predictors. Extensive experiments across several challenging environments illustrate the superior performance of our proposal over existing methods when faced with sparse rewards or noisy observations. These results underscore the potential benefits of using Bayesian inference with anchored ensembles in the field of artificial intelligence.",1
"In a large E-commerce platform, all the participants compete for impressions under the allocation mechanism of the platform. Existing methods mainly focus on the short-term return based on the current observations instead of the long-term return. In this paper, we formally establish the lifecycle model for products, by defining the introduction, growth, maturity and decline stages and their transitions throughout the whole life period. Based on such model, we further propose a reinforcement learning based mechanism design framework for impression allocation, which incorporates the first principal component based permutation and the novel experiences generation method, to maximize short-term as well as long-term return of the platform. With the power of trial-and-error, it is possible to optimize impression allocation strategies globally which is contribute to the healthy development of participants and the platform itself. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated environment built based on one of the largest E-commerce platforms, and a significant improvement has been achieved in comparison with the baseline solutions.",0

"Methods for reasoning under uncertainty are a key building block of accurate and reliable machine learning systems. Bayesian methods provide a general framework to quantify uncertainty. However, because of model misspecification and the use of approximate inference, Bayesian uncertainty estimates are often inaccurate -- for example, a 90% credible interval may not contain the true outcome 90% of the time. Here, we propose a simple procedure for calibrating any regression algorithm; when applied to Bayesian and probabilistic models, it is guaranteed to produce calibrated uncertainty estimates given enough data. Our procedure is inspired by Platt scaling and extends previous work on classification. We evaluate this approach on Bayesian linear regression, feedforward, and recurrent neural networks, and find that it consistently outputs well-calibrated credible intervals while improving performance on time series forecasting and model-based reinforcement learning tasks.",0

"One of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to real-life problems is that the amount of train-and-error required to learn a good policy increases drastically as the task becomes complex. One potential solution to this problem is to combine reinforcement learning with automated symbol planning and utilize prior knowledge on the domain. However, existing methods have limitations in their applicability and expressiveness. In this paper we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method based on abductive symbolic planning. The planner can deal with user-defined evaluation functions and is not based on the Herbrand theorem. Therefore it can utilize prior knowledge of the rewards and can work in a domain where the state space is unknown. We demonstrate empirically that our architecture significantly improves learning efficiency with respect to the amount of training examples on the evaluation domain, in which the state space is unknown and there exist multiple goals.",0
"Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has proven to be a powerful tool for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subtasks.

Abduction refers to the process of inferring explanations based on observations that cannot necessarily prove those explanations true but can disprove alternative hypotheses. By incorporating abduction into HRL, our algorithm can learn more flexible and robust policies that are better equipped to handle novel situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experimental evaluations on several benchmark domains, including grid worlds, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Our results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both task completion rates and efficiency.

We achieve stable learning at high throughput by combining decoupled acting and learning with a novel off-policy correction method called V-trace. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPALA for multi-task reinforcement learning on DMLab-30 (a set of 30 tasks from the DeepMind Lab environment (Beattie et al., 2016)) and Atari-57 (all available Atari games in Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013a)).

"One of the main challenges facing deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) algorithms today is their lack of scalability. Many state-of-the-art deep RL methods require enormous computational resources, which makes them impractical for solving problems with large or continuous state spaces. This problem becomes even more pronounced when dealing with real-world applications where datasets can be vast and complex. In this work, we present Impala, a new algorithm that addresses these issues by proposing a novel distributed architecture based on importance weighted actor-learners (IWA). Our approach combines two key components - distributed training using stochastic gradient descent and randomized value functions, and centralized selection and execution of actions to minimize variational regret. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods both in terms of sample efficiency and final performance across a range of benchmark control tasks. These findings make Impala particularly promising for real-world applications where scaling up deep RL is critical.  Overall, our work represents a major step forward in addressing the challenge of scalability in deep RL. By providing a highly efficient, distributed solution that leverages recent advances in deep learning, Impala offers a powerful tool for tackling a wide range of real-world decision making problems.

"Dexterous multi-fingered hands are extremely versatile and provide a generic way to perform a multitude of tasks in human-centric environments. However, effectively controlling them remains challenging due to their high dimensionality and large number of potential contacts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a model-agnostic approach to control complex dynamical systems, but has not been shown to scale to high-dimensional dexterous manipulation. Furthermore, deployment of DRL on physical systems remains challenging due to sample inefficiency. Consequently, the success of DRL in robotics has thus far been limited to simpler manipulators and tasks. In this work, we show that model-free DRL can effectively scale up to complex manipulation tasks with a high-dimensional 24-DoF hand, and solve them from scratch in simulated experiments. Furthermore, with the use of a small number of human demonstrations, the sample complexity can be significantly reduced, which enables learning with sample sizes equivalent to a few hours of robot experience. The use of demonstrations result in policies that exhibit very natural movements and, surprisingly, are also substantially more robust.",0

"In the field of machine learning, there has been considerable interest in understanding how algorithms learn from data, particularly in the context of continuous reinforcement learning (RL). RL involves training agents to make decisions based on feedback obtained through trial and error.

This paper seeks to address that gap by offering insights into why these problems occur, their implications for model performance, and potential solutions for mitigating their impact. We conducted experiments using popular deep neural network architectures commonly used in industrial applications to explore the extent to which they can exhibit both underfitting and overfitting behaviors across different environments. Our findings demonstrate that while overfitting can degrade the agent’s performance, appropriate regularization techniques can improve robustness and significantly reduce average regret.

"All-goals updating exploits the off-policy nature of Q-learning to update all possible goals an agent could have from each transition in the world, and was introduced into Reinforcement Learning (RL) by Kaelbling (1993). In prior work this was mostly explored in small-state RL problems that allowed tabular representations and where all possible goals could be explicitly enumerated and learned separately. In this paper we empirically explore 3 different extensions of the idea of updating many (instead of all) goals in the context of RL with deep neural networks (or DeepRL for short). First, in a direct adaptation of Kaelbling's approach we explore if many-goals updating can be used to achieve mastery in non-tabular visual-observation domains. Second, we explore whether many-goals updating can be used to pre-train a network to subsequently learn faster and better on a single main task of interest. Third, we explore whether many-goals updating can be used to provide auxiliary task updates in training a network to learn faster and better on a single main task of interest. We provide comparisons to baselines for each of the 3 extensions.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing rapidly over recent years. One key technology which has enabled these advancements is reinforcement learning (RL), where agents learn from trial and error by maximizing their cumulative reward signals. Existing RL methods primarily focus on optimizing one specific goal, but real world problems often contain multiple objectives that must be satisfied simultaneously. This paper presents a novel framework called many-goals RL that addresses this challenge by allowing agents to optimize across several goals at once. We define the notion of a ""goal"" as some desirable outcome that can be achieved through interactions with the environment, such as reaching certain positions or collecting items efficiently. In our formulation, each goal can have different importance weights assigned by the user, reflecting their individual preferences. Our main contribution lies in introducing new objective functions, algorithms, and theoretical analysis capable of handling multiple goals effectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared against single-goal baselines under complex scenarios with conflicting or complementary objectives. Additionally, we discuss potential applications such as robotics or resource allocation settings involving tradeoffs among competing priorities. Overall, many-goals RL represents a significant step forward in enabling multi-objective decision making in artificial agents operating within dynamic environments. As more and more tasks require managing diverse criteria, our work paves the road towards creating adaptive and flexible intelligent systems able to tackle increasingly intricate challenges facing society.",1

In contrast, we present an essentially different methodology by modeling the task as a sequential decision-making process. An intelligent agent is trained using reinforcement learning with hierarchical features from a deep model. Temporal consistency is integrated into our action design and reward mechanism to reduce over-segmentation errors.

"Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of surgical gesture segmentation and classification algorithms that can automatically analyze intraoperative videos and extract meaningful insights. However, these approaches often require large amounts of labeled training data, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and other limitations associated with medical imaging data. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach that leverages small amounts of labeled data along with unsupervised techniques such as self-learning and multi-task training, allowing us to achieve high levels of accuracy while minimizing reliance on extensive annotations. Our method involves using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained via Q-learning to segment surgical gestures from video frames, followed by temporal sequence modeling via recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

These findings suggest that our proposed approach holds great promise for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of robot-assisted surgeries.",1
"Neural networks allow Q-learning reinforcement learning agents such as deep Q-networks (DQN) to approximate complex mappings from state spaces to value functions. However, this also brings drawbacks when compared to other function approximators such as tile coding or their generalisations, radial basis functions (RBF) because they introduce instability due to the side effect of globalised updates present in neural networks. This instability does not even vanish in neural networks that do not have any hidden layers. In this paper, we show that simple modifications to the structure of the neural network can improve stability of DQN learning when a multi-layer perceptron is used for function approximation.",0
"This paper describes the use of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in combination with augmented neural networks (ANNs). RL algorithms allow agents to learn how to make decisions based on feedback from their environment. By incorporating deep learning techniques such as backpropagation into these models, researchers can create more complex representations that capture high-level abstractions like sequences and hierarchies. While there have been many successful applications of deep RL in recent years, one common challenge has been the difficulty in obtaining reliable gradient estimates which leads to slow convergence rates during training. To address this issue we propose two new methods: Hessian Free Newton backpropagation and Natural Gradient Ascent. Both methods provide substantial improvements over traditional policy gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches across multiple domains including robotics manipulation tasks, game playing and general sequential decision making under uncertainty problems. In most cases our methods show significant improvement over competing state of the art alternatives. We further investigate the behavior of our methods by visualizing learned policies and feature importance maps, providing insights into why our proposed method improves performance over baselines. Finally, we discuss future directions for combining deep neural network architectures with novel forms of optimization and relaxations of Bellman equations. Our results contribute to bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementations of model free RL techniques by significantly reducing computation time while preserving good solution quality, and thus may eventually open up opportunities to apply RL methods beyond simulation environments for real life control problems.",1
"Imitation learning is an effective approach for autonomous systems to acquire control policies when an explicit reward function is unavailable, using supervision provided as demonstrations from an expert, typically a human operator. However, standard imitation learning methods assume that the agent receives examples of observation-action tuples that could be provided, for instance, to a supervised learning algorithm. This stands in contrast to how humans and animals imitate: we observe another person performing some behavior and then figure out which actions will realize that behavior, compensating for changes in viewpoint, surroundings, object positions and types, and other factors. We term this kind of imitation learning ""imitation-from-observation,"" and propose an imitation learning method based on video prediction with context translation and deep reinforcement learning. This lifts the assumption in imitation learning that the demonstration should consist of observations in the same environment configuration, and enables a variety of interesting applications, including learning robotic skills that involve tool use simply by observing videos of human tool use. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in learning a wide range of real-world robotic tasks modeled after common household chores from videos of a human demonstrator, including sweeping, ladling almonds, pushing objects as well as a number of tasks in simulation.",0
"This paper presents a novel method called imitation from observation which can learn and generate new behaviors directly from raw video data. Unlike most current work that focuses on learning from pixel level supervision, our approach utilizes temporal attention mechanisms and transformer architectures to automatically extract meaningful representations of behavior from unstructured videos. We show that these extracted representations lead to significant improvements over state-of-the art methods on both benchmark datasets and challenging real world tasks like robotics manipulation and human motion prediction. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of learning complex behaviors without any explicit guidance, opening up new possibilities in areas such as computer vision and robotics. In summary, this paper offers a groundbreaking advancement towards building agents capable of observing and replicating behaviors learned solely through visual input.",1
"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed strategic behavior by fitting reinforcement learning models to behavioral data. However, traditional IRL methods are only applicable when the observations are in the form of state-action paths. This assumption may not hold in many real-world modeling settings, where only partial or summarized observations are available. In general, we may assume that there is a summarizing function $\sigma$, which acts as a filter between us and the true state-action paths that constitute the demonstration. Some initial approaches to extending IRL to such situations have been presented, but with very specific assumptions about the structure of $\sigma$, such as that only certain state observations are missing. This paper instead focuses on the most general case of the problem, where no assumptions are made about the summarizing function, except that it can be evaluated. We demonstrate that inference is still possible. The paper presents exact and approximate inference algorithms that allow full posterior inference, which is particularly important for assessing parameter uncertainty in this challenging inference situation. Empirical scalability is demonstrated to reasonably sized problems, and practical applicability is demonstrated by estimating the posterior for a cognitive science RL model based on an observed user's task completion time only.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) that uses only high-level summary data about agent behavior instead of raw state trajectories. Our method leverages recent advances in imitation learning to learn models of optimal policies directly from these summarized data. We evaluate our approach on several continuous control tasks and show that it can accurately recover ground truth models even under challenging conditions such as partial observability and missing expert demonstrations. Overall, our results demonstrate that IRL from summary data is a promising direction for scaling up model-free RL methods to more complex problems.",1
"Bayesian neural networks with latent variables are scalable and flexible probabilistic models: They account for uncertainty in the estimation of the network weights and, by making use of latent variables, can capture complex noise patterns in the data. We show how to extract and decompose uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for decision-making purposes. This allows us to successfully identify informative points for active learning of functions with heteroscedastic and bimodal noise. Using the decomposition we further define a novel risk-sensitive criterion for reinforcement learning to identify policies that balance expected cost, model-bias and noise aversion.",0

Address potential implications of your research and next steps that could further build upon your work. Use concise language and avoid jargon unless necessary. --- The need for uncertainty quantification has become increasingly important due to advances in data collection and processing technologies. In particular, deep learning models have gained popularity due to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse application domains; however, these models suffer from opacity and overconfidence issues. As a result, model interpretability remains a major challenge, especially for applications where safety and reliability are critical requirements. To address these concerns, there has been growing interest in leveraging Bayesian methods to impute probabilistic reasoning abilities into neural networks, enabling them to produce well-calibrated uncertainties during inference. By exploiting recent advances in variational inference techniques, we develop novel Bayesian deep learning (BDL) architectures capable of efficient decomposition of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties at training time. Our proposed approach enables accurate and calibrated estimation of predictive entropy associated with each prediction, which provides a direct measure of risk sensitivity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using extensive experiments on image classification tasks, revealing improved robustness against adversarial perturbations while attaining comparable accuracy metrics to non-risk sensitive BDL models. Our work can potentially impact real-world applications across multiple disciplines, and future directions involve investigating hybrid approaches combining model averaging with ensembling strategies",1

The algorithms employ the multi-timescale stochastic approximation variant of the very popular cross entropy (CE) optimization method which is a model based search method to find the global optimum of a real-valued function. A proof of convergence of the algorithms using the ODE method is provided. We supplement our theoretical results with experimental comparisons. The algorithms achieve good performance fairly consistently on many RL benchmark problems with regards to computational efficiency, accuracy and stability.",0
This abstract presents an online prediction algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation using cross entropy method (CEM). RL algorithms learn policies by interacting with their environment. State representation is essential in enabling these agents to efficiently explore their state space. We focus on model-free actor critic architecture where experience data contains all possible observations and actions that the agent can make during interaction. The main contribution is a novel state space discretization method based on clustering states into bins whose size depends on the range of each observed feature value. Each bin represents a discrete state which enables efficient policy training through linear function approximators such as deep neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate improved exploration speed over existing methods resulting from effective online prediction of Q values utilizing CEM within our trained model. These results have significant implications for real world applications where fast learning rates coupled with good performance are critical such as autonomous driving vehicles and robotics tasks. However further testing with more complex environments would be beneficial. Finally we plan to extend current research to model-based architectures which often require explicit knowledge of the transition dynamics. Overall our proposed approach provides a promising direction towards enabling faster decision making in large scale complex environments.,1
"In this work, we build on recent advances in distributional reinforcement learning to give a generally applicable, flexible, and state-of-the-art distributional variant of DQN. We achieve this by using quantile regression to approximate the full quantile function for the state-action return distribution. By reparameterizing a distribution over the sample space, this yields an implicitly defined return distribution and gives rise to a large class of risk-sensitive policies. We demonstrate improved performance on the 57 Atari 2600 games in the ALE, and use our algorithm's implicitly defined distributions to study the effects of risk-sensitive policies in Atari games.",0
"Title: Quantile Regression in Reachability-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning Authors: Jiajun Wu, Chengtao Qu, Shibei Zhang, Yong Tang Abstract In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress on solving sequential decision making tasks across multiple domains. However, these methods rely heavily on reward shaping techniques like importance sampling to balance exploration against exploitation. In practice, manually specifying these rewards can be difficult and time-consuming, especially in cases where the optimal policy must satisfy certain constraints such as safety, reliability, or fairness considerations. To address this gap, we propose Quantile Regression based Deep Reinforcement Learning (QRDRL), which learns quantile regression models that estimate expectiles from sampled trajectories of rollouts. Our method integrates reachability analysis into the QL algorithm using these estimated quantiles, providing explicit guarantees on the probability of constraint satisfaction at any point during training. We demonstrate empirically how our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art RL algorithms by significantly reducing constraint violation rates and achieving higher cumulative returns while satisfying the specified safety requirements. Finally, we showcase our results on a set of challenging benchmark environments and argue why our model effectively incorporates knowledge of distributions within the training process.",1
"We introduce a new algorithm for reinforcement learning called Maximum aposteriori Policy Optimisation (MPO) based on coordinate ascent on a relative entropy objective. We show that several existing methods can directly be related to our derivation. We develop two off-policy algorithms and demonstrate that they are competitive with the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning. In particular, for continuous control, our method outperforms existing methods with respect to sample efficiency, premature convergence and robustness to hyperparameter settings while achieving similar or better final performance.",0
"This is the abstract for a technical paper discussing methods for optimizing policies using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. MAP estimation is a powerful technique used in statistics and machine learning that allows us to estimate parameters given observed data by finding the most probable values given some set of assumptions. In the context of policy optimization, we can use MAP estimation to find the most likely policy that maximizes expected reward given a set of observations about our environment. Our approach builds on recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and uses neural networks to approximate the mapping from states to actions. We evaluate our method on several challenging tasks and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy. Overall, this work represents an important step forward in the field of artificial intelligence and has numerous potential applications in areas such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing.",1
"We explore the use of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for optimization problems in transportation. Many transportation system analysis tasks are formulated as an optimization problem - such as optimal control problems in intelligent transportation systems and long term urban planning. Often transportation models used to represent dynamics of a transportation system involve large data sets with complex input-output interactions and are difficult to use in the context of optimization. Use of deep learning metamodels can produce a lower dimensional representation of those relations and allow to implement optimization and reinforcement learning algorithms in an efficient manner. In particular, we develop deep learning models for calibrating transportation simulators and for reinforcement learning to solve the problem of optimal scheduling of travelers on the network.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to solving dynamic urban transportation problems using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We propose a DRL algorithm that can effectively optimize both traffic signal control and route planning simultaneously in real-time. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn from data generated by our simulated city environment, enabling us to efficiently identify optimal solutions based on current traffic conditions and individual users’ preferences. In traditional approaches to urban transportation optimization, static traffic signal control schedules and precomputed routing plans are often used. However, these methods can become quickly outdated due to changing traffic patterns caused by accidents, road closures, or other unpredictable events. In contrast, our proposed DRL framework adapts to such changes in real time, making it more suitable for complex transportation systems where dynamic adjustments are required. We evaluate the performance of our DRL agent against state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms through extensive simulation experiments in different scenarios, including various network sizes and types of mobility demand. Results show that our model consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of average travel time, vehicle delays, and environmental impacts. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of DRL as a powerful tool for managing urban transportation issues. Future research directions may involve integrating additional features into our framework, expanding our evaluation platform, and exploring ways to make our system scalable enough for deployment in large-scale metropolitan areas.",1
"Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to control dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (PDE). This paper shows how to use RL to tackle more general PDE control problems that have continuous high-dimensional action spaces with spatial relationship among action dimensions. In particular, we propose the concept of action descriptors, which encode regularities among spatially-extended action dimensions and enable the agent to control high-dimensional action PDEs. We provide theoretical evidence suggesting that this approach can be more sample efficient compared to a conventional approach that treats each action dimension separately and does not explicitly exploit the spatial regularity of the action space. The action descriptor approach is then used within the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Experiments on two PDE control problems, with up to 256-dimensional continuous actions, show the advantage of the proposed approach over the conventional one.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to reinforcement learning (RL) that allows for function-valued action spaces in control problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We show how such function-valued actions can lead to improved performance over traditional scalar-valued approaches, especially in situations where spatially varying controls may provide additional degrees of freedom necessary for solving high-dimensional PDE control problems. Our method utilizes deep neural networks to parameterize both the value functions and policies, while ensuring satisfaction of PDE constraints via regularization terms during training. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark test cases, demonstrating significant improvement compared to existing RL methods using only scalar-valued control functions. These results have important implications for the broader field of scientific machine learning and demonstrate the potential power of using function-valued actions within RL algorithms to solve complex control problems.",1
"Active learning (AL) aims to enable training high performance classifiers with low annotation cost by predicting which subset of unlabelled instances would be most beneficial to label. The importance of AL has motivated extensive research, proposing a wide variety of manually designed AL algorithms with diverse theoretical and intuitive motivations. In contrast to this body of research, we propose to treat active learning algorithm design as a meta-learning problem and learn the best criterion from data. We model an active learning algorithm as a deep neural network that inputs the base learner state and the unlabelled point set and predicts the best point to annotate next. Training this active query policy network with reinforcement learning, produces the best non-myopic policy for a given dataset. The key challenge in achieving a general solution to AL then becomes that of learner generalisation, particularly across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a multi-task dataset-embedding approach that allows dataset-agnostic active learners to be trained. Our evaluation shows that AL algorithms trained in this way can directly generalise across diverse problems.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex tasks requiring active learning strategies. However, most existing works have focused on specific task settings without considering transferability across different datasets or environments. This paper proposes a meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn and adapt active learning policies across multiple tasks, domains, or modalities. We address three important challenges: (i) how to leverage unlabeled data during adaptation; (ii) how to balance exploration vs exploitation effectively in few-shot scenarios; and (iii) how to design model architectures for efficient transferability. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly in low-data regimes. These results emphasize the potential benefits of integrating meta-learning techniques into active sampling paradigms for enhanced generalization performance.",1
"There is growing evidence that converting targets to soft targets in supervised learning can provide considerable gains in performance. Much of this work has considered classification, converting hard zero-one values to soft labels---such as by adding label noise, incorporating label ambiguity or using distillation. In parallel, there is some evidence from a regression setting in reinforcement learning that learning distributions can improve performance. In this work, we investigate the reasons for this improvement, in a regression setting. We introduce a novel distributional regression loss, and similarly find it significantly improves prediction accuracy. We investigate several common hypotheses, around reducing overfitting and improved representations. We instead find evidence for an alternative hypothesis: this loss is easier to optimize, with better behaved gradients, resulting in improved generalization. We provide theoretical support for this alternative hypothesis, by characterizing the norm of the gradients of this loss.",0

After typing that write: Abstract: In this paper we study how the use of distributional losses in regression tasks improves performance on multiple metrics compared to traditional binary cross entropy loss. We introduce two new techniques; one based on the KL divergence which acts like a reweighting term and a second technique called ""Sinkhorn Loss"" which allows us to use soft weights obtained via Sinkhorn Divergences. Using these losses we improve performance across multiple datasets outperforming related work on most and achieving comparable results where previous approaches were better suited due to their more expressive architecture. Finally, we discuss how our improvements might be applied to other model classes including semi supervised learning methods such as MixMatch and UDA.

"Modern reinforcement learning algorithms reach super-human performance on many board and video games, but they are sample inefficient, i.e. they typically require significantly more playing experience than humans to reach an equal performance level. To improve sample efficiency, an agent may build a model of the environment and use planning methods to update its policy. In this article we introduce Variational State Tabulation (VaST), which maps an environment with a high-dimensional state space (e.g. the space of visual inputs) to an abstract tabular model. Prioritized sweeping with small backups, a highly efficient planning method, can then be used to update state-action values. We show how VaST can rapidly learn to maximize reward in tasks like 3D navigation and efficiently adapt to sudden changes in rewards or transition probabilities.",0
"In recent years there has been renewed interest in applying deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to sequential decision making problems across many fields, including robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, and game playing. These methods have demonstrated great success at handling complex tasks by learning policies directly from raw sensory inputs without requiring any explicit state representation or human engineering of features. While these model-free RL methods hold great promise, they suffer from several limitations that restrict their applicability. Foremost among them is their sample complexity; that is, they require large amounts of data to achieve good results. This makes them impractical for use on real systems where acquiring data may be expensive or time consuming. Furthermore, model-based approaches that use learned value functions or predictive models can significantly reduce sample complexity, but few such techniques scale beyond small-scale simulations or toy environments due to computational intractability when faced with larger domains and more general deep neural network function approximators. Finally, current model-based methods either must approximate the value function using a low-capacity function class that limits performance or they rely on tabular representations of states and actions which become computationally intractable as the state space grows. To overcome these limitations we present an algorithm called efficient model-based deep reinforcement learning with variational state tabulation. We provide theoretical analysis to show how our approach leads to improved learning efficiency compared to prior art both theoretically and empirically demonstrate improvements over existing model-based methods in challenging simulation benchmarks. Our method shows significant reduction in average episode cost relative to Batch DQN, reducing th",1
"In traditional reinforcement learning, an agent maximizes the reward collected during its interaction with the environment by approximating the optimal policy through the estimation of value functions. Typically, given a state s and action a, the corresponding value is the expected discounted sum of rewards. The optimal action is then chosen to be the action a with the largest value estimated by value function. However, recent developments have shown both theoretical and experimental evidence of superior performance when value function is replaced with value distribution in context of deep Q learning [1]. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm that combines advantage actor-critic with value distribution estimated by quantile regression. We evaluated this new algorithm, termed Distributional Advantage Actor-Critic (DA2C or QR-A2C) on a variety of tasks, and observed it to achieve at least as good as baseline algorithms, and outperforming baseline in some tasks with smaller variance and increased stability.",0
"The field of reinforcement learning has seen significant progress in recent years due to advancements in deep neural networks and the development of novel algorithms that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks.

In this paper, we present DAAC as a promising approach for solving challenging continuous control problems, where traditional models may struggle. We evaluate DAAC on a variety of benchmark control tasks, including inverted pendulum and mountain car, demonstrating its ability to learn effective policies quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis of DAAC, highlighting key advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of sample complexity and stability. Our results suggest that DAAC represents an exciting direction for future research in the domain of distributional RL.",1
"We study how to effectively leverage expert feedback to learn sequential decision-making policies. We focus on problems with sparse rewards and long time horizons, which typically pose significant challenges in reinforcement learning. We propose an algorithmic framework, called hierarchical guidance, that leverages the hierarchical structure of the underlying problem to integrate different modes of expert interaction. Our framework can incorporate different combinations of imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) at different levels, leading to dramatic reductions in both expert effort and cost of exploration. Using long-horizon benchmarks, including Montezuma's Revenge, we demonstrate that our approach can learn significantly faster than hierarchical RL, and be significantly more label-efficient than standard IL. We also theoretically analyze labeling cost for certain instantiations of our framework.",0
"In this study, we explore the intersection of imitation learning and reinforcement learning through the use of hierarchical task structures. We propose that by breaking down complex tasks into smaller subtasks and using imitation to learn each subtask separately, agents can more efficiently and effectively solve larger tasks. This approach allows agents to leverage both their own experience as well as the experiences of others who have previously solved similar problems. Our results show that this hierarchical imitation and reinforcement learning (HIRL) algorithm outperforms traditional single-level imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms across a range of simulated environments, demonstrating the potential for HIRL to improve performance on real world tasks as well. Additionally, our analysis suggests that combining these two forms of learning enables the agent to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to better overall performance. Overall, our work provides new insights into how agents can learn and solve complex tasks in realistic settings, opening up exciting possibilities for future research in artificial intelligence.",1
"In model-based reinforcement learning it is typical to decouple the problems of learning the dynamics model and learning the reward function. However, when the dynamics model is flawed, it may generate erroneous states that would never occur in the true environment. It is not clear a priori what value the reward function should assign to such states. This paper presents a novel error bound that accounts for the reward model's behavior in states sampled from the model. This bound is used to extend the existing Hallucinated DAgger-MC algorithm, which offers theoretical performance guarantees in deterministic MDPs that do not assume a perfect model can be learned. Empirically, this approach to reward learning can yield dramatic improvements in control performance when the dynamics model is flawed.",0
"In recent years we have seen impressive results on learning reward functions from human feedback for Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents using inverse reinforcement learning (RL2). However, these approaches assume that the environment dynamics used by the agent and the one used by humans to provide feedback match exactly which might not always hold true. Human feedback can come in many forms such as natural language commands, preferences over trajectories, even images and videos that may only implicitly define some aspects of the target behavior. We show that model misspecification arises naturally when learning from complex human directions through DAgger, a trust region method proposed for inverse reinforcement learning which uses trajectory rollouts to evaluate the potential improvement achieved by applying actions at different time steps given a current policy. In this work we propose methods to learn a proper reward function which works under real world assumptions about the correspondence between user intentions and their expressions while still allowing generalization to new situations and more accurate evaluations of policies. We demonstrate the validity of our approach using both continuous control and discrete action environments, showing improvements over traditional Dagger on several standard benchmarks such as MountainCarContinuous-v1, Hopper-v1, Walker2d-v1, Reacher-Episodic-v0.",1
"We propose a fully automatic method to find standardized view planes in 3D image acquisitions. Standard view images are important in clinical practice as they provide a means to perform biometric measurements from similar anatomical regions. These views are often constrained to the native orientation of a 3D image acquisition. Navigating through target anatomy to find the required view plane is tedious and operator-dependent. For this task, we employ a multi-scale reinforcement learning (RL) agent framework and extensively evaluate several Deep Q-Network (DQN) based strategies. RL enables a natural learning paradigm by interaction with the environment, which can be used to mimic experienced operators. We evaluate our results using the distance between the anatomical landmarks and detected planes, and the angles between their normal vector and target. The proposed algorithm is assessed on the mid-sagittal and anterior-posterior commissure planes of brain MRI, and the 4-chamber long-axis plane commonly used in cardiac MRI, achieving accuracy of 1.53mm, 1.98mm and 4.84mm, respectively.",0
"This work introduces an automatic view planning system which uses multi-scale deep reinforcement learning agents. The proposed approach can generate views from any initial image, regardless of scale, and automatically selects the most informative parts of images without supervision.  The agent has two components: (i) a high level policy that selects among different state spaces characterizing the input image and determines the action space (region proposal); (ii) a low-level policy that generates a dense set of region proposals, representing all possible viewpoints. Each region proposal generated by the lower level policy defines a candidate viewpoint.  Experiments show improved performance over current state-of-the-art baselines on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for generating highly diverse sets of views. Results further indicate the ability to generalize well across domains and scales, providing more consistent performances than previous approaches.  This research provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying human visual attention for understanding complex scenes and opens up new directions towards developing fully autonomous artificial intelligence systems.",1
"The balance between exploration and exploitation is a key problem for reinforcement learning methods, especially for Q-learning. In this paper, a fidelity-based probabilistic Q-learning (FPQL) approach is presented to naturally solve this problem and applied for learning control of quantum systems. In this approach, fidelity is adopted to help direct the learning process and the probability of each action to be selected at a certain state is updated iteratively along with the learning process, which leads to a natural exploration strategy instead of a pointed one with configured parameters. A probabilistic Q-learning (PQL) algorithm is first presented to demonstrate the basic idea of probabilistic action selection. Then the FPQL algorithm is presented for learning control of quantum systems. Two examples (a spin- 1/2 system and a lamda-type atomic system) are demonstrated to test the performance of the FPQL algorithm. The results show that FPQL algorithms attain a better balance between exploration and exploitation, and can also avoid local optimal policies and accelerate the learning process.",0
"This paper presents a novel fidelity-based probabilistic approach to quantum control using Q-Learning algorithms.

In addition, we introduce a new type of exploration strategy based on randomized control unitary operators that enables efficient search over the control parameter space while reducing sampling complexity. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm employs a Bayesian framework, enabling estimation of uncertainty in the optimal controls. Results from numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving significantly higher levels of target state preparation fidelities than traditional open-loop optimization methods across a wide range of examples, including spin chains and molecular systems. Overall, our work provides a valuable contribution towards realizing reliable and robust high-fidelity quantum operations.",1
"An appealing property of the natural gradient is that it is invariant to arbitrary differentiable reparameterizations of the model. However, this invariance property requires infinitesimal steps and is lost in practical implementations with small but finite step sizes. In this paper, we study invariance properties from a combined perspective of Riemannian geometry and numerical differential equation solving. We define the order of invariance of a numerical method to be its convergence order to an invariant solution. We propose to use higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections to obtain more invariant optimization trajectories. We prove the numerical convergence properties of geodesic corrected updates and show that they can be as computationally efficient as plain natural gradient. Experimentally, we demonstrate that invariance leads to faster optimization and our techniques improve on traditional natural gradient in deep neural network training and natural policy gradient for reinforcement learning.",0

Experimental results demonstrate significant speedup on several important application domains including image processing, control systems design, and deep learning. This work makes an important contribution to the field by providing efficient algorithms that are easy to implement and use. As such, it has broad impact across many areas where high performance optimization is necessary.",1
"In this work, we take a representation learning perspective on hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the problem of learning lower layers in a hierarchy is transformed into the problem of learning trajectory-level generative models. We show that we can learn continuous latent representations of trajectories, which are effective in solving temporally extended and multi-stage problems. Our proposed model, SeCTAR, draws inspiration from variational autoencoders, and learns latent representations of trajectories. A key component of this method is to learn both a latent-conditioned policy and a latent-conditioned model which are consistent with each other. Given the same latent, the policy generates a trajectory which should match the trajectory predicted by the model. This model provides a built-in prediction mechanism, by predicting the outcome of closed loop policy behavior. We propose a novel algorithm for performing hierarchical RL with this model, combining model-based planning in the learned latent space with an unsupervised exploration objective. We show that our model is effective at reasoning over long horizons with sparse rewards for several simulated tasks, outperforming standard reinforcement learning methods and prior methods for hierarchical reasoning, model-based planning, and exploration.",0
"Title: ""Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Trajectory Embeddings""  Abstract: This paper presents a new method for hierarchical reinforcement learning called the Self-Consistent Trajectory Autoencoder (SCTA). SCTA uses trajectory embeddings to represent sequences of states as low-dimensional vectors that can be used by the agent to learn high-level policies. By doing so, the agent learns to decompose complex tasks into smaller subtasks, enabling efficient exploration of large action spaces. Our approach uses self-consistency constraints on the embedding process, ensuring that different aspects of the task hierarchy can be learned separately while still maintaining consistency across levels. We evaluate our approach using several benchmark environments from the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating improved performance compared to traditional RL algorithms. In addition, we analyze the behavior of agents trained with SCTA and provide insights into how hierarchies emerge during training. Overall, our work provides a promising step towards understanding hierarchical reinforcement learning with embeddings.",1
"We introduce a new function-preserving transformation for efficient neural architecture search. This network transformation allows reusing previously trained networks and existing successful architectures that improves sample efficiency. We aim to address the limitation of current network transformation operations that can only perform layer-level architecture modifications, such as adding (pruning) filters or inserting (removing) a layer, which fails to change the topology of connection paths. Our proposed path-level transformation operations enable the meta-controller to modify the path topology of the given network while keeping the merits of reusing weights, and thus allow efficiently designing effective structures with complex path topologies like Inception models. We further propose a bidirectional tree-structured reinforcement learning meta-controller to explore a simple yet highly expressive tree-structured architecture space that can be viewed as a generalization of multi-branch architectures. We experimented on the image classification datasets with limited computational resources (about 200 GPU-hours), where we observed improved parameter efficiency and better test results (97.70% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 14.3M parameters and 74.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in the mobile setting), demonstrating the effectiveness and transferability of our designed architectures.",0
"This work presents path level network transformation as a methodology for efficient architecture search that drastically reduces computational requirements while providing state of the art performance on common benchmarks. By transforming each path through a deep neural network separately we enable an order of magnitude speedup in both training and evaluation time compared to full scale training and search procedures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several well known computer vision datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet, using popular architectures such as VGG, ResNet, Inception, and DenseNet. Our results consistently outperform published records across all four datasets for most architectures and show comparable accuracy on more complex models like DenseNet. Path Level Network Transformation (PLNT) represents a promising new direction for automating deep learning research by allowing practitioners to quickly explore large design spaces at low cost.",1
"The General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition and its associated software framework provides a way of benchmarking AI algorithms on a large number of games written in a domain-specific description language. While the competition has seen plenty of interest, it has so far focused on online planning, providing a forward model that allows the use of algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search.   In this paper, we describe how we interface GVGAI to the OpenAI Gym environment, a widely used way of connecting agents to reinforcement learning problems. Using this interface, we characterize how widely used implementations of several deep reinforcement learning algorithms fare on a number of GVGAI games. We further analyze the results to provide a first indication of the relative difficulty of these games relative to each other, and relative to those in the Arcade Learning Environment under similar conditions.",0
"Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for General Video Game AI ---------------------------------------------------------------  This paper presents a novel approach to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that enables agents to learn complex behaviors across multiple domains within video games. We propose using state-of-the art neural network architectures such as DQN, DDPG and TD3, combined with advanced exploration strategies like NoisyNet and BOLFIRE. Our methodology allows agents to efficiently learn from large amounts of data generated through trial-and-error by focusing on relevant features of the environment rather than just maximizing accumulated reward. Additionally, we incorporate human feedback into our training process, enabling more accurate evaluation of agent performance in complex tasks. Experimental results show that our methods consistently outperform traditional approaches across numerous game environments, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our framework. Finally, we discuss possible future directions for further improving DRL algorithms for general video game AI, including hierarchical task decomposition and multi-agent collaboration.

"Many real-world sequential decision making problems are partially observable by nature, and the environment model is typically unknown. Consequently, there is great need for reinforcement learning methods that can tackle such problems given only a stream of incomplete and noisy observations. In this paper, we propose deep variational reinforcement learning (DVRL), which introduces an inductive bias that allows an agent to learn a generative model of the environment and perform inference in that model to effectively aggregate the available information. We develop an n-step approximation to the evidence lower bound (ELBO), allowing the model to be trained jointly with the policy. This ensures that the latent state representation is suitable for the control task. In experiments on Mountain Hike and flickering Atari we show that our method outperforms previous approaches relying on recurrent neural networks to encode the past.",0
"Here is a potential abstract: ""Modeling and solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) remains challenging due to their inherent complexity arising from incomplete state observations and hidden state variables. To address these difficulties, we propose deep variational reinforcement learning (DVRL), which represents belief states using neural networks and learns both policies and belief dynamics jointly through maximum log posterior inference. Through extensive evaluation on real-world problems and comparisons with other methods, our results demonstrate that DVRL can effectively learn optimal policies even under uncertainty while outperforming prior approaches."" The full version of the article would then detail how variational inference and deep reinforcement learning were combined within a unified framework for modeling belief states as probabilistic distributions over possible system configurations. Empirical evaluations would test the approach against multiple baselines including other POMDP solvers and alternative reinforcement learning algorithms. Applications could span diverse domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance. A later section might discuss broader implications regarding the integration of machine learning into artificial intelligence systems beyond classical problem solving paradigms like planning and search. These insights could highlight promising research directions toward more human-like reasoning abilities, opening possibilities for collaboration between experts across scientific fields.",1
"Deep learning on graph structures has shown exciting results in various applications. However, few attentions have been paid to the robustness of such models, in contrast to numerous research work for image or text adversarial attack and defense. In this paper, we focus on the adversarial attacks that fool the model by modifying the combinatorial structure of data. We first propose a reinforcement learning based attack method that learns the generalizable attack policy, while only requiring prediction labels from the target classifier. Also, variants of genetic algorithms and gradient methods are presented in the scenario where prediction confidence or gradients are available. We use both synthetic and real-world data to show that, a family of Graph Neural Network models are vulnerable to these attacks, in both graph-level and node-level classification tasks. We also show such attacks can be used to diagnose the learned classifiers.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text generation. However, these models often struggle with understanding complex, structured data that requires relational reasoning beyond simple keyword matching. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using adversarial attacks to evaluate graph-structured neural networks (GSNNs) trained on benchmark datasets such as FB15k and WN18RR. We propose a new attack methodology called GAttack that generates targeted adversarial examples by minimizing the prediction error of randomly initialized GSNNs through gradient descent steps constrained to obey edge deletions/additions in the knowledge graphs. Our experimental results show that our attacks consistently decrease the accuracy of state-of-the-art GSNNs by up to 42% while keeping a small number of edge modifications. These findings highlight the vulnerability of current GSNN architectures to well-crafted adversarial examples and emphasize the need for further research into robustness against such attacks.

"In many real-world settings, a team of agents must coordinate their behaviour while acting in a decentralised way. At the same time, it is often possible to train the agents in a centralised fashion in a simulated or laboratory setting, where global state information is available and communication constraints are lifted. Learning joint action-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive way to exploit centralised learning, but the best strategy for then extracting decentralised policies is unclear. Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based method that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. QMIX employs a network that estimates joint action-values as a complex non-linear combination of per-agent values that condition only on local observations. We structurally enforce that the joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, which allows tractable maximisation of the joint action-value in off-policy learning, and guarantees consistency between the centralised and decentralised policies. We evaluate QMIX on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, and show that QMIX significantly outperforms existing value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.",0
"This paper presents QMIX, a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on monotonic value function factorization that enables agents to learn jointly even if they receive delayed rewards due to interdependencies among the actions of multiple agents. We provide theoretical results showing that QMIX converges faster than existing algorithms in simple settings where individual contributions can be measured accurately by each agent’s visitation count. We then demonstrate how our method scales up performance beyond prior state-of-the-art methods across challenging environments from cooperative navigation to competitive games like StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, establishing itself as a strong candidate for use in real world applications. -----",1
"Domain adaptation is an important open problem in deep reinforcement learning (RL). In many scenarios of interest data is hard to obtain, so agents may learn a source policy in a setting where data is readily available, with the hope that it generalises well to the target domain. We propose a new multi-stage RL agent, DARLA (DisentAngled Representation Learning Agent), which learns to see before learning to act. DARLA's vision is based on learning a disentangled representation of the observed environment. Once DARLA can see, it is able to acquire source policies that are robust to many domain shifts - even with no access to the target domain. DARLA significantly outperforms conventional baselines in zero-shot domain adaptation scenarios, an effect that holds across a variety of RL environments (Jaco arm, DeepMind Lab) and base RL algorithms (DQN, A3C and EC).",0
"Abstract In this work we present DARLA (Data Augmentation via Random Latent Access), which significantly improves zero-shot transfer performance across diverse environments by using data augmentation on latent spaces learned from expert demonstrations. Data augmentation has been shown effective at improving generalization and robustness of machine learning models, but applying it to RL is challenging as collecting large amounts of high quality training data can take hundreds or thousands of iterations. By generating new trajectories directly in latent space DARLA enables fast and efficient generation of large quantities of data that lead to better RL performance both when starting from scratch and when using pre-trained policies as initialization. We evaluate DARLA against standard supervised learning benchmarks and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in tasks such as Atari games and locomotion control of humanoid robots. We conclude that our method effectively addresses the problem of lacking data in reinforcement learning and makes RL more applicable to real world problems where data collection can be difficult, costly or unethical.",1
"We propose to learn a curriculum or a syllabus for supervised learning and deep reinforcement learning with deep neural networks by an attachable deep neural network, called ScreenerNet. Specifically, we learn a weight for each sample by jointly training the ScreenerNet and the main network in an end-to-end self-paced fashion. The ScreenerNet neither has sampling bias nor requires to remember the past learning history. We show the networks augmented with the ScreenerNet achieve early convergence with better accuracy than the state-of-the-art curricular learning methods in extensive experiments using three popular vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR10 and Pascal VOC2012, and a Cart-pole task using Deep Q-learning.

"One possible abstract for ""ScreenerNet: Learning Self-Paced Curriculum for Deep Neural Networks"" could be as follows: Artificial intelligence has made significant advances in recent years due to deep neural networks (DNNs) that can learn complex representations from large amounts of data. However, training DNNs remains computationally expensive and time consuming. Existing methods that attempt to accelerate learning by selecting informative samples at each iteration have limited scalability and fail to address the class imbalance problem. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-paced curriculum framework called ScreenerNet that automatically schedules which examples to use next based on their importance scores calculated using both the error gradient method and uncertainty sampling techniques. Our proposed screener component uses a confidence model to estimate uncertainty and select hard examples while ignoring unimportant ones, thus focusing more resources on meaningful tasks.

"This paper considers the problem of inverse reinforcement learning in zero-sum stochastic games when expert demonstrations are known to be not optimal. Compared to previous works that decouple agents in the game by assuming optimality in expert strategies, we introduce a new objective function that directly pits experts against Nash Equilibrium strategies, and we design an algorithm to solve for the reward function in the context of inverse reinforcement learning with deep neural networks as model approximations. In our setting the model and algorithm do not decouple by agent. In order to find Nash Equilibrium in large-scale games, we also propose an adversarial training algorithm for zero-sum stochastic games, and show the theoretical appeal of non-existence of local optima in its objective function. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our Nash Equilibrium and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms address games that are not amenable to previous approaches using tabular representations. Moreover, with sub-optimal expert demonstrations our algorithms recover both reward functions and strategies with good quality.",0

Competitive Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Sub-Optimal Demonstrations  Abstract: In multi-agent systems, coordination among agents is crucial for achieving optimal performance. Traditional methods rely on explicit communication and centralized planning, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios due to limited communication bandwidth and privacy concerns. As an alternative, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) allows agents to infer each other’s goals through observing their behaviors. However, previously known approaches either assume full observability of others’ actions, require access to optimal demonstration trajectories, or only focus on cooperative settings. This paper proposes a novel framework called competitive multi-agent IRL with sub-optimal demonstrations (CMIRL). Our method uses deep neural networks to learn reward functions for each agent while considering partial observability of other agents’ actions. By leveraging both cooperation and competition, our method improves collaboration without relying exclusively on optimality criteria. We evaluate CMIRL in several benchmark environments and compare its performance against state-of-the-art alternatives. Our experiments show that CMIRL outperforms baseline models and provides significant improvements over traditional IRL algorithms. Additionally, CMIRL offers practical insights into understanding human decision making under uncertainty and partial observability constraints. Overall, our research advances the field of multi-agent IRL and paves the way for future studies in decentralized learning architectures, policy synthesis, and behavior interpretation.

"Reinforcement learning and symbolic planning have both been used to build intelligent autonomous agents. Reinforcement learning relies on learning from interactions with real world, which often requires an unfeasibly large amount of experience. Symbolic planning relies on manually crafted symbolic knowledge, which may not be robust to domain uncertainties and changes. In this paper we present a unified framework {\em PEORL} that integrates symbolic planning with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to cope with decision-making in a dynamic environment with uncertainties.   Symbolic plans are used to guide the agent's task execution and learning, and the learned experience is fed back to symbolic knowledge to improve planning. This method leads to rapid policy search and robust symbolic plans in complex domains. The framework is tested on benchmark domains of HRL.",0
"Research has shown that both symbolic planning and hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) can lead to effective decision making in complex environments. However, each approach has its own limitations and shortcomings. In this work, we propose a new framework called Partially Observable Environments Robust Learning (PEORL), which integrates symbolic planning and HRL to address these limitations and improve robustness in decision making. Our framework allows agents to use symbolic planning to create plans based on their current knowledge and goals, while incorporating HRL techniques to learn more effectively from partial observations in uncertain environments. This integrated approach enables the agent to make better decisions by adapting to changing circumstances and learning from feedback. We evaluate our framework through experiments in simulated domains, demonstrating improved performance over standalone planning and HRL approaches. Overall, our results show the promise of using combined symbolic planning and HRL methods for more robust decision-making in partially observable environments.",1
"We introduce Mix&Match (M&M) - a training framework designed to facilitate rapid and effective learning in RL agents, especially those that would be too slow or too challenging to train otherwise. The key innovation is a procedure that allows us to automatically form a curriculum over agents. Through such a curriculum we can progressively train more complex agents by, effectively, bootstrapping from solutions found by simpler agents. In contradistinction to typical curriculum learning approaches, we do not gradually modify the tasks or environments presented, but instead use a process to gradually alter how the policy is represented internally. We show the broad applicability of our method by demonstrating significant performance gains in three different experimental setups: (1) We train an agent able to control more than 700 actions in a challenging 3D first-person task; using our method to progress through an action-space curriculum we achieve both faster training and better final performance than one obtains using traditional methods. (2) We further show that M&M can be used successfully to progress through a curriculum of architectural variants defining an agents internal state. (3) Finally, we illustrate how a variant of our method can be used to improve agent performance in a multitask setting.",0
"Here is an example: ""Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to train agents that can solve complex tasks efficiently without any manual supervision. Recently, RL algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains such as games, robotics, and autonomous driving. However, these successes came at a cost; obtaining good results often required careful selection of model architectures, hyperparameters, exploration strategies, etc.""",1
Exogenous state variables and rewards can slow down reinforcement learning by injecting uncontrolled variation into the reward signal. We formalize exogenous state variables and rewards and identify conditions under which an MDP with exogenous state can be decomposed into an exogenous Markov Reward Process involving only the exogenous state+reward and an endogenous Markov Decision Process defined with respect to only the endogenous rewards. We also derive a variance-covariance condition under which Monte Carlo policy evaluation on the endogenous MDP is accelerated compared to using the full MDP. Similar speedups are likely to carry over to all RL algorithms. We develop two algorithms for discovering the exogenous variables and test them on several MDPs. Results show that the algorithms are practical and can significantly speed up reinforcement learning.,0
"This paper presents methods to discover state variables that should be removed from reinforcement learning domains and rewards designed by humans that should be either modified or eliminated. We describe how these exogenous factors can have significant influence over agent behavior, leading to suboptimal solutions on real world tasks. Our work includes case studies on MuJoCo locomotion problems where we demonstrate improved performance after modifying human reward functions. Additionally, through a systematic search method across Atari games, we uncover several exogeneous factors that were previously unknown and show their impacts on task performance. Finally, our analysis reveals connections between different sources of noise and informativeness levels in RL environments. Overall, we highlight the importance of understanding and addressing unwanted external influences in RL research and provide tools and techniques for doing so in practice.",1
"Recent developments have established the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning to policy manipulation attacks via intentionally perturbed inputs, known as adversarial examples. In this work, we propose a technique for mitigation of such attacks based on addition of noise to the parameter space of deep reinforcement learners during training. We experimentally verify the effect of parameter-space noise in reducing the transferability of adversarial examples, and demonstrate the promising performance of this technique in mitigating the impact of whitebox and blackbox attacks at both test and training times.",0
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising techniques for training autonomous agents to make decisions in complex, uncertain environments. At the heart of many DRL algorithms lies the deep Q-network (DQN), which learns a mapping from states to expected long-term future reward through trial-and-error interaction with the environment. However, this learning process makes DQNs vulnerable to policy manipulation attacks, where an adversary intentionally perturbs the state space to deceive the agent into choosing suboptimal actions. This paper investigates whether adding noise to the parameters of a DQN can reduce the susceptibility of policy manipulation attacks while maintaining the same level of performance compared to original non-noised version of the network. Experiments show that parameter-space noise mitigates the effectiveness of simple policy manipulations by randomizing their impact across multiple time steps and episodes, making them harder to learn and exploit. Overall, these results provide insights into improving the robustness of DQNs without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy.",1
"While current deep learning systems excel at tasks such as object classification, language processing, and gameplay, few can construct or modify a complex system such as a tower of blocks. We hypothesize that what these systems lack is a ""relational inductive bias"": a capacity for reasoning about inter-object relations and making choices over a structured description of a scene. To test this hypothesis, we focus on a task that involves gluing pairs of blocks together to stabilize a tower, and quantify how well humans perform. We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning agent which uses object- and relation-centric scene and policy representations and apply it to the task. Our results show that these structured representations allow the agent to outperform both humans and more naive approaches, suggesting that relational inductive bias is an important component in solving structured reasoning problems and for building more intelligent, flexible machines.",0
"Humans have had some success at developing robots that can perform complex tasks involving manual dexterity, but these systems tend to require extensive hand engineering, are brittle to changes in their environment, and struggle generalizing beyond the specific domains they were designed for. This suggests that there may be something missing from current approaches - specifically a more flexible and adaptive relational inductive bias than has been used previously. Here we propose a model based on the concept of ""construction kits"" (CKs) - tools that allow users to build other objects by combining elements according to simple rules. We focus on providing CKs directly to the robot arms themselves rather than relying solely on external fixturing, allowing them to synthesize control signals directly from sensor data using learned models. Our results suggest substantial improvements over existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. In particular, we find that our approach allows for rapid adaptation to new environments without requiring additional specialized training; it supports real-time task execution on difficult multi-step manipulation problems while being robust to large amounts of noise in state estimation; it exhibits highly adaptive behavior such as self-calibration following unexpected perturbations during plan execution; and can even lead to emergent problem solving capabilities as the agent incrementally discovers new ways to achieve high quality solutions by exploring the space of potential action sequences conditioned only on feedback from sensory observations. These benefits are a result of integrating three key components: learning to predict physics dynamics in video frames captured by onboard cameras; exploiting those predictions within a probabilis",1
"Our understanding of reinforcement learning (RL) has been shaped by theoretical and empirical results that were obtained decades ago using tabular representations and linear function approximators. These results suggest that RL methods that use temporal differencing (TD) are superior to direct Monte Carlo estimation (MC). How do these results hold up in deep RL, which deals with perceptually complex environments and deep nonlinear models? In this paper, we re-examine the role of TD in modern deep RL, using specially designed environments that control for specific factors that affect performance, such as reward sparsity, reward delay, and the perceptual complexity of the task. When comparing TD with infinite-horizon MC, we are able to reproduce classic results in modern settings. Yet we also find that finite-horizon MC is not inferior to TD, even when rewards are sparse or delayed. This makes MC a viable alternative to TD in deep RL.",0
"This paper examines the role of temporal differencing (TD) in deep reinforcement learning. We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of TD learning and how it has been applied in traditional RL settings. Next, we explore the use of TD methods in the context of modern deep RL algorithms, such as Deep Q Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C). Through empirical evaluation on several benchmark tasks, we demonstrate that incorporating TD can lead to significant improvements in training stability and overall performance. Our results show that TD plays a crucial role in enabling efficient exploration and exploitation in large state spaces, particularly when combined with other techniques like experience replay and randomized networks. Finally, we conclude by discussing potential directions for future research on the intersection of deep RL and TD methods.",1
"The research on deep reinforcement learning which estimates Q-value by deep learning has been attracted the interest of researchers recently.

"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved significant success in solving complex sequential decision making problems. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence due to their reliance on bootstrapping techniques that can lead to high variance policies. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Neural Episodic Control (NEC) that addresses the issue of slow policy improvement by explicitly modeling past experiences within each episode. We introduce a neuro-episodic buffer that stores and updates the learned value function as well as the visited states during training. This allows NEC to leverage both temporal and spatial correlations in experience replay to improve stability and sample efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that NEC outperforms state-of-the-art deep Q-learning methods across multiple domains, including discrete action spaces and continuous control tasks. Additionally, our analysis shows that NEC converges faster than other methods while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the potential of neural episodic models to tackle some of the fundamental challenges facing current RL algorithms.",1
"The deep reinforcement learning method usually requires a large number of training images and executing actions to obtain sufficient results. When it is extended a real-task in the real environment with an actual robot, the method will be required more training images due to complexities or noises of the input images, and executing a lot of actions on the real robot also becomes a serious problem. Therefore, we propose an extended deep reinforcement learning method that is applied a generative model to initialize the network for reducing the number of training trials. In this paper, we used a deep q-network method as the deep reinforcement learning method and a deep auto-encoder as the generative model. We conducted experiments on three different tasks: a cart-pole game, an atari game, and a real-game with an actual robot. The proposed method trained efficiently on all tasks than the previous method, especially 2.5 times faster on a task with real environment images.",0

"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be adept at solving sequential decision processes with high-dimensional state spaces such as in the Atari games. Many reinforcement learning problems, however, involve high-dimensional discrete action spaces as well as high-dimensional state spaces. This paper considers entropy bonus, which is used to encourage exploration in policy gradient. In the case of high-dimensional action spaces, calculating the entropy and its gradient requires enumerating all the actions in the action space and running forward and backpropagation for each action, which may be computationally infeasible. We develop several novel unbiased estimators for the entropy bonus and its gradient. We apply these estimators to several models for the parameterized policies, including Independent Sampling, CommNet, Autoregressive with Modified MDP, and Autoregressive with LSTM. Finally, we test our algorithms on two environments: a multi-hunter multi-rabbit grid game and a multi-agent multi-arm bandit problem. The results show that our entropy estimators substantially improve performance with marginal additional computational cost.",0
"This research focuses on solving the challenge that arises from calculating entropy in policy gradient methods that have a multidimensional action space. Previous studies have used scalarization techniques such as entropy regularization to address this issue; however, these approaches are insufficient when dealing with large state spaces. Our method calculates entropy using a novel approach based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two policies with different temperature parameters. By introducing additional terms to the loss function, we can directly optimize the expected cumulative reward while taking into account the uncertainty associated with selecting actions in high dimensions. We evaluate our method through experiments on various domains, demonstrating improved performance compared to previous methods. These findings contribute to the field of reinforcement learning by providing an efficient solution for estimating entropy in multi-dimensional action spaces, which has numerous potential applications in artificial intelligence.",1
"Episodic memory is a psychology term which refers to the ability to recall specific events from the past. We suggest one advantage of this particular type of memory is the ability to easily assign credit to a specific state when remembered information is found to be useful. Inspired by this idea, and the increasing popularity of external memory mechanisms to handle long-term dependencies in deep learning systems, we propose a novel algorithm which uses a reservoir sampling procedure to maintain an external memory consisting of a fixed number of past states. The algorithm allows a deep reinforcement learning agent to learn online to preferentially remember those states which are found to be useful to recall later on. Critically this method allows for efficient online computation of gradient estimates with respect to the write process of the external memory. Thus unlike most prior mechanisms for external memory it is feasible to use in an online reinforcement learning setting.",0
"This paper presents a method for integrating episodic memory into a reinforcement learning agent through reservoir sampling. We propose that incorporating past experiences can improve the performance of existing RL algorithms by allowing agents to generalize across similar situations and make better informed decisions. Our approach utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) as the memory mechanism, which stores previous episodes as samples in its hidden state. When faced with a new situation, the agent retrieves relevant memories from its past experiences via attention mechanisms, and combines them with current input to formulate a more informed action selection process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing improved performance on a range of benchmark tasks compared to standard RL algorithms without memory integration.",1
"We study active object tracking, where a tracker takes as input the visual observation (i.e., frame sequence) and produces the camera control signal (e.g., move forward, turn left, etc.). Conventional methods tackle the tracking and the camera control separately, which is challenging to tune jointly. It also incurs many human efforts for labeling and many expensive trial-and-errors in realworld. To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an end-to-end solution via deep reinforcement learning, where a ConvNet-LSTM function approximator is adopted for the direct frame-toaction prediction. We further propose an environment augmentation technique and a customized reward function, which are crucial for a successful training. The tracker trained in simulators (ViZDoom, Unreal Engine) shows good generalization in the case of unseen object moving path, unseen object appearance, unseen background, and distracting object. It can restore tracking when occasionally losing the target. With the experiments over the VOT dataset, we also find that the tracking ability, obtained solely from simulators, can potentially transfer to real-world scenarios.",0
"We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for end-to-end active object tracking using deep neural networks (DNNs). Our method jointly optimizes both feature extraction from raw image pixels and policy network parameters that maximize cumulative rewards received during tracking, all within one unified DNN model. For state representation learning we present a modified variant of the actor critic architecture based on multi-scale features extracted from multiple layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are then fused into a single high level representation through feedforward neural networks (FNNs). In the proposed model, the RL agent learns to select actions by mapping the current state representation to an action probability distribution over several predefined actions. For each training episode we simulate multiple frames where the target object moves according to random motion models. At each time step, our reward function provides a measure of how well the generated bounding box around the target object fits the ground truth bounding box, while discouraging large changes in the position of the predicted bounding boxes. By optimizing these two competing goals simultaneously through gradient ascent, the learned DNN policies achieve better accuracy than state-of-the-art trackers and outperform existing methods by significant margins in terms of precision and speed metrics.",1
"Scheduling the transmission of time-sensitive data to multiple users over error-prone communication channels is studied with the goal of minimizing the long-term average age of information (AoI) at the users under a constraint on the average number of transmissions at the source node. After each transmission, the source receives an instantaneous ACK/NACK feedback from the intended receiver and decides on what time and to which user to transmit the next update. The optimal scheduling policy is first studied under different feedback mechanisms when the channel statistics are known; in particular, the standard automatic repeat request (ARQ) and hybrid ARQ (HARQ) protocols are considered. Then a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is introduced, which does not assume any a priori information on the random processes governing the channel states. Different RL methods are verified and compared through numerical simulations.",0
"In multi-user networks, determining the optimal transmission policy for each user is crucial for achieving high performance in terms of throughput and delay. One important metric that has gained significant attention recently is age of information (AoI), which measures how fresh the received updates at the destination are compared to their generation time at the source. This work proposes a reinforcement learning approach to find the optimal transmission policies for users under different system configurations, such as channel conditions and number of users. The proposed algorithm learns from experience by observing the rewards associated with different actions taken by each user based on the observed feedback signals. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of minimizing the global AoI while satisfying quality of service requirements for all users. Overall, the use of reinforcement learning provides a powerful tool for addressing challenges related to network control and optimization in modern communication systems.",1
Self-play is an unsupervised training procedure which enables the reinforcement learning agents to explore the environment without requiring any external rewards. We augment the self-play setting by providing an external memory where the agent can store experience from the previous tasks. This enables the agent to come up with more diverse self-play tasks resulting in faster exploration of the environment. The agent pretrained in the memory augmented self-play setting easily outperforms the agent pretrained in no-memory self-play setting.,0

Memory Augmented Self Play Paper Abstract: This research studies how computer agents can learn from experience by playing games against themselves. By doing so, they improve their decision making skills through trial and error, identifying patterns that help them make better choices over time. Building on prior work in self play algorithms, we introduce memory augmentation. Agents equipped with memories can more effectively identify similarities across experiences, enabling faster learning and stronger generalization. Our experiments test different types of memories on several Atari games, comparing the performance of self played agents before and after augmenting memory. Results show clear improvements in most cases and shed light on which memory modalities perform well for certain tasks. With our findings, we hope to inspire further exploration into combining self play and memory augmentation techniques for enhancing artificial intelligence capabilities.",1
"Most artificial intelligence models have limiting ability to solve new tasks faster, without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The recently emerging paradigm of continual learning aims to solve this issue, in which the model learns various tasks in a sequential fashion. In this work, a novel approach for continual learning is proposed, which searches for the best neural architecture for each coming task via sophisticatedly designed reinforcement learning strategies. We name it as Reinforced Continual Learning. Our method not only has good performance on preventing catastrophic forgetting but also fits new tasks well. The experiments on sequential classification tasks for variants of MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing continual learning alternatives for deep networks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to continual learning called reinforced continual learning (RCL). In RCL, we use policy gradients to maximize future discounted rewards while accounting for previous knowledge accumulated by the agent over time. Unlike traditional methods that rely on experience replay, our method directly updates the model parameters without losing important past experiences through random sampling techniques such as shuffling buffers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using several benchmark tasks including classical control problems, deep reinforcement learning tasks, and transfer learning scenarios across multiple environments. Our results show that RCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves better generalization performance compared to other continual learning algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm can seamlessly integrate into existing deep learning frameworks like PyTorch without any modification. Overall, our work shows the potential benefits of combining policy gradient methods with memory retention mechanisms for efficient continual learning systems.",1
"Much attention has been devoted recently to the development of machine learning algorithms with the goal of improving treatment policies in healthcare. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sub-field within machine learning that is concerned with learning how to make sequences of decisions so as to optimize long-term effects. Already, RL algorithms have been proposed to identify decision-making strategies for mechanical ventilation, sepsis management and treatment of schizophrenia. However, before implementing treatment policies learned by black-box algorithms in high-stakes clinical decision problems, special care must be taken in the evaluation of these policies.   In this document, our goal is to expose some of the subtleties associated with evaluating RL algorithms in healthcare. We aim to provide a conceptual starting point for clinical and computational researchers to ask the right questions when designing and evaluating algorithms for new ways of treating patients. In the following, we describe how choices about how to summarize a history, variance of statistical estimators, and confounders in more ad-hoc measures can result in unreliable, even misleading estimates of the quality of a treatment policy. We also provide suggestions for mitigating these effects---for while there is much promise for mining observational health data to uncover better treatment policies, evaluation must be performed thoughtfully.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex decision-making problems in healthcare. However, evaluating RL algorithms in observational health settings presents unique challenges due to the high dimensionality and uncertainty of the data, as well as the ethical considerations surrounding patient privacy and safety. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art RL algorithms on simulated and real-world observational health datasets, comparing their effectiveness in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. Our results show that while all algorithms performed reasonably well across different metrics, some approaches were better suited for certain types of tasks or data characteristics. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of our analysis and suggest future directions for improving the evaluation of RL algorithms in healthcare. Overall, this work contributes to the growing body of research on using machine learning techniques to improve health outcomes, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges of applying these methods in practice.",1
"We propose a new way of deriving policy gradient updates for reinforcement learning. Our technique, based on Fourier analysis, recasts integrals that arise with expected policy gradients as convolutions and turns them into multiplications. The obtained analytical solutions allow us to capture the low variance benefits of EPG in a broad range of settings. For the critic, we treat trigonometric and radial basis functions, two function families with the universal approximation property. The choice of policy can be almost arbitrary, including mixtures or hybrid continuous-discrete probability distributions. Moreover, we derive a general family of sample-based estimators for stochastic policy gradients, which unifies existing results on sample-based approximation. We believe that this technique has the potential to shape the next generation of policy gradient approaches, powered by analytical results.",0
"Incorporate at least two technical terms from the paper: policy gradients, amortized policy optimization. Limit use of jargon as intended audience is a general scientific community, but should still sound authoritative. Mention broad application areas covered by the paper; e.g., robotics control, machine translation, bioinformatics. Conclude that the approach is efficient and scalable, and promises significant impact on both research and industry practices in these fields. ---  Abstract: Policy gradient methods have become popular due to their ability to learn complex policies directly from raw input data. However, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) sampling based approaches often suffer from high variance and sample complexity which make them computationally expensive and inefficient. This work presents Fourier Policy Gradient, an algorithmic framework which overcomes the limitations of MC-based methods by utilizing amortized policy optimization techniques. The proposed method can efficiently train neural network policies across a wide range of applications such as robotics control, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the art algorithms while requiring fewer samples. Our findings suggest promising implications for future research and industrial practices within these domains.  ---",1
"Deep generative models for graph-structured data offer a new angle on the problem of chemical synthesis: by optimizing differentiable models that directly generate molecular graphs, it is possible to side-step expensive search procedures in the discrete and vast space of chemical structures. We introduce MolGAN, an implicit, likelihood-free generative model for small molecular graphs that circumvents the need for expensive graph matching procedures or node ordering heuristics of previous likelihood-based methods. Our method adapts generative adversarial networks (GANs) to operate directly on graph-structured data. We combine our approach with a reinforcement learning objective to encourage the generation of molecules with specific desired chemical properties. In experiments on the QM9 chemical database, we demonstrate that our model is capable of generating close to 100% valid compounds. MolGAN compares favorably both to recent proposals that use string-based (SMILES) representations of molecules and to a likelihood-based method that directly generates graphs, albeit being susceptible to mode collapse.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can generate molecules with desired properties for use in drug discovery and other fields. One approach to generating molecules is through the use of graph neural networks (GNNs), which have shown promise in representing and generating small molecular graphs. However, most GNNs require explicit node features, which may not always be readily available. To address this limitation, we present a new method called MolGAN, which uses an implicit generative model based on GNNs to generate small molecular graphs without requiring explicit node features. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and outperforms baseline models that rely on explicit node features. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to several challenging tasks, including de novo molecule generation and property prediction. Overall, our results suggest that MolGAN provides a powerful tool for generating small molecular graphs with desirable properties and opens up new possibilities for applications in chemical engineering and related fields.",1
"The question of how to explore, i.e., take actions with uncertain outcomes to learn about possible future rewards, is a key question in reinforcement learning (RL). Here, we show a surprising result: We show that Q-learning with nonlinear Q-function and no explicit exploration (i.e., a purely greedy policy) can learn several standard benchmark tasks, including mountain car, equally well as, or better than, the most commonly-used $\epsilon$-greedy exploration. We carefully examine this result and show that both the depth of the Q-network and the type of nonlinearity are important to induce such deterministic exploration.",0
Increasing depth of neural networks often results in better performance but raises questions regarding interpretability,1
"Despite significant advances in the field of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), today's algorithms still fail to learn human-level policies consistently over a set of diverse tasks such as Atari 2600 games. We identify three key challenges that any algorithm needs to master in order to perform well on all games: processing diverse reward distributions, reasoning over long time horizons, and exploring efficiently. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that addresses each of these challenges and is able to learn human-level policies on nearly all Atari games. A new transformed Bellman operator allows our algorithm to process rewards of varying densities and scales; an auxiliary temporal consistency loss allows us to train stably using a discount factor of $\gamma = 0.999$ (instead of $\gamma = 0.99$) extending the effective planning horizon by an order of magnitude; and we ease the exploration problem by using human demonstrations that guide the agent towards rewarding states. When tested on a set of 42 Atari games, our algorithm exceeds the performance of an average human on 40 games using a common set of hyper parameters. Furthermore, it is the first deep RL algorithm to solve the first level of Montezuma's Revenge.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress in solving complex tasks across diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. However, performance inconsistency still remains one of the major challenges when applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world problems. In particular, performance inconsistencies observed in continuous control tasks can lead to safety risks and unpredictability issues that hinder further advancements in artificial intelligence applications. This research addresses these limitations by investigating factors that contribute to performance consistency in deep reinforcement learning models and presenting methods designed to enhance reliability and stability in decision making under uncertainty. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm named Observe and Look Further (OALF), which integrates model predictive control with ensemble model selection techniques to achieve consistent performance in benchmark Atari games. Our findings demonstrate improved stability and robustness compared to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning approaches, providing new insights into ensuring safe and reliable behavior in artificial agents operating in uncertain environments.",1
"We show that when a third party, the adversary, steps into the two-party setting (agent and operator) of safely interruptible reinforcement learning, a trade-off has to be made between the probability of following the optimal policy in the limit, and the probability of escaping a dangerous situation created by the adversary. So far, the work on safely interruptible agents has assumed a perfect perception of the agent about its environment (no adversary), and therefore implicitly set the second probability to zero, by explicitly seeking a value of one for the first probability. We show that (1) agents can be made both interruptible and adversary-resilient, and (2) the interruptibility can be made safe in the sense that the agent itself will not seek to avoid it. We also solve the problem that arises when the agent does not go completely greedy, i.e. issues with safe exploration in the limit. Resilience to perturbed perception, safe exploration in the limit, and safe interruptibility are the three pillars of what we call \emph{virtuously safe reinforcement learning}.",0
"Title: ""Virtuous Behavior and Ethical Considerations in Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence, enabling machines to learn from experience by maximizing reward signals. However, concerns have been raised regarding the potential negative consequences of RL algorithms that lack appropriate ethical considerations. This study explores the concept of virtuous behavior within the context of RL and proposes methods for ensuring safe and ethically sound decision making in reinforcement learning systems. We investigate how incorporating moral values and virtuous principles into the design and evaluation of RL algorithms can lead to more socially acceptable outcomes. Our results suggest that integrating ethics into RL leads to significantly safer and morally desirable decisions across a variety of scenarios. Overall, our work contributes to the development of trustworthy and responsible artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of considering virtue alongside efficiency and effectiveness in the pursuit of intelligent technology.",1
"In this paper, we propose to combine imitation and reinforcement learning via the idea of reward shaping using an oracle. We study the effectiveness of the near-optimal cost-to-go oracle on the planning horizon and demonstrate that the cost-to-go oracle shortens the learner's planning horizon as function of its accuracy: a globally optimal oracle can shorten the planning horizon to one, leading to a one-step greedy Markov Decision Process which is much easier to optimize, while an oracle that is far away from the optimality requires planning over a longer horizon to achieve near-optimal performance. Hence our new insight bridges the gap and interpolates between imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Motivated by the above mentioned insights, we propose Truncated HORizon Policy Search (THOR), a method that focuses on searching for policies that maximize the total reshaped reward over a finite planning horizon when the oracle is sub-optimal. We experimentally demonstrate that a gradient-based implementation of THOR can achieve superior performance compared to RL baselines and IL baselines even when the oracle is sub-optimal.",0
"This paper proposes a new algorithm called ""Truncated Horizon Policy Search"" (THPS) which combines reinforcement learning and imitation learning in order to efficiently find effective policies that solve complex tasks. THPS works by first training an agent using reinforcement learning techniques on a short horizon of experiences, then fine-tuning the policy through imitation learning from additional demonstrations. By combining these two approaches, THPS is able to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, leading to more efficient and stable results compared to traditional methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of domains including Atari games, robot manipulation tasks, and StarCraft Micromanagement.",1
"We consider the transfer of experience samples (i.e., tuples  s, a, s', r ) in reinforcement learning (RL), collected from a set of source tasks to improve the learning process in a given target task. Most of the related approaches focus on selecting the most relevant source samples for solving the target task, but then all the transferred samples are used without considering anymore the discrepancies between the task models. In this paper, we propose a model-based technique that automatically estimates the relevance (importance weight) of each source sample for solving the target task. In the proposed approach, all the samples are transferred and used by a batch RL algorithm to solve the target task, but their contribution to the learning process is proportional to their importance weight. By extending the results for importance weighting provided in supervised learning literature, we develop a finite-sample analysis of the proposed batch RL algorithm. Furthermore, we empirically compare the proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art approaches, showing that it achieves better learning performance and is very robust to negative transfer, even when some source tasks are significantly different from the target task.",0
"In addition to other contributions from AI researchers studying RL methods, our research examines one specific method that uses weighting factors drawn from analysis of human value judgments about relative importance. This approach addresses one particular challenge faced by prior models: how should an agent assign attention to different available experiences? Our proposed algorithm adjusts each experience according to both sample frequency and some measure of task significance. It then averages these adjusted samples into an estimate of Q-values for guiding subsequent actions. An ablation study shows clear improvement over the baseline model. Extrapolating this work can open up new paths towards building agents that learn more like humans. For example, we can apply insights gained here to improve exploration efficiency via intrinsically motivated behavior or design better imitation learning algorithms modeled on human teacher-student interaction. Improved understanding of transferring experiences across tasks could lead us closer to developing adaptive AIs able to perform creative problem solving under unpredictable circumstances. Finally, this line of inquiry may inform future multiagent systems where coordinated teamwork requires balancing individual contributions based on their varying degrees of impact on overall success.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has proven to be an effective tool for creating general video-game AI. However most current DRL video-game agents learn end-to-end from the video-output of the game, which is superfluous for many applications and creates a number of additional problems. More importantly, directly working on pixel-based raw video data is substantially distinct from what a human player does.In this paper, we present a novel method which enables DRL agents to learn directly from object information. This is obtained via use of an object embedding network (OEN) that compresses a set of object feature vectors of different lengths into a single fixed-length unified feature vector representing the current game-state and fulfills the DRL simultaneously. We evaluate our OEN-based DRL agent by comparing to several state-of-the-art approaches on a selection of games from the GVG-AI Competition. Experimental results suggest that our object-based DRL agent yields performance comparable to that of those approaches used in our comparative study.",0
"This research investigates how artificial intelligence can learn general video game playing skills from scratch using reinforcement learning techniques that leverage large amounts of online data. We train deep neural networks that play games using raw game screenshots as input, and we show significant performance gains over prior methods across a range of Atari 2600 games. Our approach uses a novel object embedding network architecture inspired by computer vision models, which effectively extracts meaningful features directly from pixels without the need for manually designed preprocessing steps or domain knowledge. We demonstrate improved robustness and adaptability compared to existing RL approaches on a suite of games beyond those seen during training, including several previously unsolved challenges. Finally, we provide qualitative analysis suggesting our agent is indeed learning semantically meaningful concepts rather than relying solely on high-level pixel patterns. Overall, these results represent a step towards creating agents capable of tackling more complex tasks in complex environments beyond classical board games or simulation domains.",1
"Imitation learning (IL) consists of a set of tools that leverage expert demonstrations to quickly learn policies. However, if the expert is suboptimal, IL can yield policies with inferior performance compared to reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we aim to provide an algorithm that combines the best aspects of RL and IL. We accomplish this by formulating several popular RL and IL algorithms in a common mirror descent framework, showing that these algorithms can be viewed as a variation on a single approach. We then propose LOKI, a strategy for policy learning that first performs a small but random number of IL iterations before switching to a policy gradient RL method. We show that if the switching time is properly randomized, LOKI can learn to outperform a suboptimal expert and converge faster than running policy gradient from scratch. Finally, we evaluate the performance of LOKI experimentally in several simulated environments.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training agents that can perform complex tasks in high-dimensional continuous state spaces. However, finding effective RL algorithms remains challenging due to issues such as sample inefficiency and instability. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework called ""Fast Policy Learning through Imitation and Reinforcement"" (FPLIR). FPLIR combines imitation learning from demonstrations with model-free policy optimization, allowing agents to learn policies rapidly while leveraging both exploration and exploitation. Our method effectively balances behavior cloning and policy search by introducing an adaptive importance sampling distribution over trajectories generated by either the expert or the agent. This allows our algorithm to achieve more efficient use of data and better stability compared to existing approaches. We validate the performance of FPLIR on several challenging continuous control benchmarks, including classic MuJoCo locomotion tasks, difficult variants of Mountain Car, and the challenging task of controlling a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Results show that FPLIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all domains, achieving higher rewards faster and requiring fewer samples per second to converge. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing robust and efficient methods for training intelligent agents.",1
"We consider reinforcement learning in changing Markov Decision Processes where both the state-transition probabilities and the reward functions may vary over time. For this problem setting, we propose an algorithm using a sliding window approach and provide performance guarantees for the regret evaluated against the optimal non-stationary policy. We also characterize the optimal window size suitable for our algorithm. These results are complemented by a sample complexity bound on the number of sub-optimal steps taken by the algorithm. Finally, we present some experimental results to support our theoretical analysis.",0
"A sliding window algorithm provides approximate solutions to problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently. In the case of dynamic programming problems such as Markov decision processes (MDP), these algorithms allow for efficient computation of optimal policies even when the reward function or transition probabilities change over time. This work presents a new sliding window method for MDPs with arbitrarily changing rewards and transitions. We prove formal guarantees on the quality of the policy produced by our algorithm compared to the true optimum. Our experiments show significant improvements over existing methods in terms of solution accuracy and speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in real-world settings, specifically in model predictive control for buildings’ energy management systems. Overall, our contribution furthers the development of efficient algorithms for solving large scale MDPs under uncertainty.",1
"Policy evaluation with linear function approximation is an important problem in reinforcement learning. When facing high-dimensional feature spaces, such a problem becomes extremely hard considering the computation efficiency and quality of approximations. We propose a new algorithm, LSTD($\lambda$)-RP, which leverages random projection techniques and takes eligibility traces into consideration to tackle the above two challenges. We carry out theoretical analysis of LSTD($\lambda$)-RP, and provide meaningful upper bounds of the estimation error, approximation error and total generalization error. These results demonstrate that LSTD($\lambda$)-RP can benefit from random projection and eligibility traces strategies, and LSTD($\lambda$)-RP can achieve better performances than prior LSTD-RP and LSTD($\lambda$) algorithms.",0
"In recent years, policy gradient methods have emerged as promising tools for solving reinforcement learning problems due to their efficiency and scalability. Among these methods, least squares temporal difference (LSTD) has been widely used because of its simplicity and computational advantage over other policy gradient algorithms such as REINFORCE and TRPO. However, existing finite sample analysis of LSTD assume that either the feature vectors or state-action pairs are fixed or bounded, which may limit their applicability in real-world scenarios where data can be high dimensional and unbounded. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the regret bounds of LSTD with random projections and eligibility traces under finite samples. We provide new regret bounds for both episodic and cumulative settings that account for the randomness introduced by both the features and the number of episodes. Our results show that using random projections together with eligibility traces can effectively reduce the regret even when the dataset is small or noisy. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates how different hyperparameters impact the performance of LSTD, providing insights into selecting appropriate parameters for specific applications. Overall, our work contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of LSTD in practice and enables more accurate comparisons with other policy gradient methods.",1
"We design a new myopic strategy for a wide class of sequential design of experiment (DOE) problems, where the goal is to collect data in order to to fulfil a certain problem specific goal. Our approach, Myopic Posterior Sampling (MPS), is inspired by the classical posterior (Thompson) sampling algorithm for multi-armed bandits and leverages the flexibility of probabilistic programming and approximate Bayesian inference to address a broad set of problems. Empirically, this general-purpose strategy is competitive with more specialised methods in a wide array of DOE tasks, and more importantly, enables addressing complex DOE goals where no existing method seems applicable. On the theoretical side, we leverage ideas from adaptive submodularity and reinforcement learning to derive conditions under which MPS achieves sublinear regret against natural benchmark policies.",0
"In this paper we present novel algorithms for Bayesian design of experiments (DOE) that scale better than existing methods, enable new applications to complex problems, improve results, increase understanding of how designs impact performance measures, offer more flexibility in accounting for uncertainty and variability in prior knowledge, use less computational resources, allow efficient sensitivity analysis and optimization under severe model ignorance scenarios, provide interpretable results without sacrificing accuracy, lead to more efficient data collection, reduce time and costs for design development and implementation, increase experiment yield, and enable quick feedback based on preliminary results. We achieve these advances by constructing myopic sequential designs adapted from posterior samples generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques applied to probabilistic programming languages like PyMC3 or TensorFlow Probability. We demonstrate our methodology’s power across three diverse application areas: pharmaceutical formulation for reducing drug delivery failure rate; space mission design to maximize scientific return at minimal cost; and environmental monitoring of microplastics concentration over location and time. By combining advantages of DOE, probabilistic programming, and deep learning architectures within a unified framework, our work enables effective decision making even in highly uncertain environments while offering transparency into model components and parameter estimation errors. These contributions bridge multiple disciplines, extend research frontiers, and create value for practitioners. We believe our work opens promising directions for future research into large-scale simulation-based decision support under severe model uncertainty",1
"The goal of reinforcement learning algorithms is to estimate and/or optimise the value function. However, unlike supervised learning, no teacher or oracle is available to provide the true value function. Instead, the majority of reinforcement learning algorithms estimate and/or optimise a proxy for the value function. This proxy is typically based on a sampled and bootstrapped approximation to the true value function, known as a return. The particular choice of return is one of the chief components determining the nature of the algorithm: the rate at which future rewards are discounted; when and how values should be bootstrapped; or even the nature of the rewards themselves. It is well-known that these decisions are crucial to the overall success of RL algorithms. We discuss a gradient-based meta-learning algorithm that is able to adapt the nature of the return, online, whilst interacting and learning from the environment. When applied to 57 games on the Atari 2600 environment over 200 million frames, our algorithm achieved a new state-of-the-art performance.",0
In this work we present a new model training methodology called meta-gradient reinforcement learning (meta-GRL). This approach combines meta-learning techniques from the field of machine learning and gradient based model optimization techniques commonly used in deep reinforcement learning models. Our results show that using meta gradient updates significantly improves both speed of convergence as well as final performance on downstream tasks. Additionally we demonstrate significant improvements over traditional gradient based methods in challenging robotics applications such as grasping and quadruped locomotion. Overall these contributions represent important progress towards automating end-to-end training for complex real world robotic systems. We hope our findings inspire further research into combining meta learning techniques with RL to develop more capable models that can learn even faster.,1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) recently emerged as one of the most competitive approaches for learning in sequential decision making problems with fully observable environments, e.g., computer Go. However, very little work has been done in deep RL to handle partially observable environments. We propose a new architecture called Action-specific Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADRQN) to enhance learning performance in partially observable domains. Actions are encoded by a fully connected layer and coupled with a convolutional observation to form an action-observation pair. The time series of action-observation pairs are then integrated by an LSTM layer that learns latent states based on which a fully connected layer computes Q-values as in conventional Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new architecture in several partially observable domains, including flickering Atari games.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence, enabling agents to learn optimal policies through trial and error in complex environments. One important class of RL problems are partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which require maintaining belief states about unobservable aspects of the environment. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved impressive results on many challenging tasks. However, training deep neural networks can still suffer from issues such as instability, vanishing gradients, and lack of interpretability. This paper presents several strategies that address these concerns and improve upon state-of-the-art methods in solving POMDPs using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach integrates insights from both model-free and model-based RL, allowing us to effectively balance exploration and exploitation in highly uncertain domains. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over prior work across a range of benchmark tasks, illustrating the effectiveness and generality of our methodology. By advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning in POMDP settings, we open new opportunities for building intelligent systems capable of operating under uncertainty and making informed decisions based on imperfect information.",1
"A core novelty of Alpha Zero is the interleaving of tree search and deep learning, which has proven very successful in board games like Chess, Shogi and Go. These games have a discrete action space. However, many real-world reinforcement learning domains have continuous action spaces, for example in robotic control, navigation and self-driving cars. This paper presents the necessary theoretical extensions of Alpha Zero to deal with continuous action space. We also provide some preliminary experiments on the Pendulum swing-up task, empirically showing the feasibility of our approach. Thereby, this work provides a first step towards the application of iterated search and learning in domains with a continuous action space.",0

"Dyna-style reinforcement learning is a powerful approach for problems where not much real data is available. The main idea is to supplement real trajectories, or sequences of sampled states over time, with simulated ones sampled from a learned model of the environment. However, in large state spaces, the problem of learning a good generative model of the environment has been open so far. We propose to use deep belief networks to learn an environment model for use in Dyna. We present our approach and validate it empirically on problems where the state observations consist of images. Our results demonstrate that using deep belief networks, which are full generative models, significantly outperforms the use of linear expectation models, proposed in Sutton et al. (2008)",0
"This study proposes a new approach to dynamic planning using feature-based generative models (FBGMs). FBGMs have been shown to effectively model complex, high-dimensional datasets by learning meaningful features that capture underlying patterns and relationships within data points. Inspired by these successes, we apply a similar strategy to dynamic planning problems.  In our framework, a planner first learns a low-dimensional representation of possible states and actions based on observed data from previous interactions with an environment. These learned features serve as a compact approximation of the full state space, enabling efficient search and decision making during planning. We further improve upon traditional FBGM methods through two innovations: (i) structured regularization techniques tailored to the specific demands of planning tasks; and (ii) iteratively updating both the generator and discriminator networks to better align their objectives towards solving planning problems.  We evaluate our method against several benchmark domains, comparing performance to both classical and contemporary approaches to planning under uncertainty. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our FBGM-based planner across diverse problem types and complexity levels. Overall, this work represents a novel application of advanced machine learning principles to automated decision making under uncertainty. Our contributions lay the groundwork for future research into more generalizable and effective solutions to challenging planning problems, with potential impacts in fields ranging from robotics to logistics to healthcare.",1
"We introduce reinforcement learning for heterogeneous teams in which rewards for an agent are additively factored into local costs, stimuli unique to each agent, and global rewards, those shared by all agents in the domain. Motivating domains include coordination of varied robotic platforms, which incur different costs for the same action, but share an overall goal. We present two templates for learning in this setting with factored rewards: a generalization of Perkins' Monte Carlo exploring starts for POMDPs to canonical MPOMDPs, with a single policy mapping joint observations of all agents to joint actions (MCES-MP); and another with each agent individually mapping joint observations to their own action (MCES-FMP). We use probably approximately local optimal (PALO) bounds to analyze sample complexity, instantiating these templates to PALO learning. We promote sample efficiency by including a policy space pruning technique, and evaluate the approaches on three domains of heterogeneous agents demonstrating that MCES-FMP yields improved policies in less samples compared to MCES-MP and a previous benchmark.",0
"In multi-agent systems where each agent has a different role, goal, or action set, reinforcement learning can become challenging due to uncertainty over agents’ actions and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose using PALO bounds that restrict the range of possible policies and allow agents to make more informed decisions based on their own knowledge. We develop an algorithm called HERTA (HETerogeneouS TEams with REinforceThrough Approximation) that uses PALO bounds in tandem with Q-learning to achieve efficient exploration and exploitation in both single and mixed-initiative settings. Our experimental results show that HERTA outperforms existing methods for diverse tasks such as graph coloring and game playing while being robust to changes in team composition. These findings suggest that HERTA is a promising approach for enabling teams of agents with varying capabilities and objectives to learn effective strategies through trial and error. This work extends our previous research by incorporating PALO bounds into reinforcement learning frameworks for heterogeneous teams, paving the way for future applications of RL algorithms across domains involving cooperating agents with unique characteristics.",1
"In e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and TaoBao, ranking items in a search session is a typical multi-step decision-making problem. Learning to rank (LTR) methods have been widely applied to ranking problems. However, such methods often consider different ranking steps in a session to be independent, which conversely may be highly correlated to each other. For better utilizing the correlation between different ranking steps, in this paper, we propose to use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn an optimal ranking policy which maximizes the expected accumulative rewards in a search session. Firstly, we formally define the concept of search session Markov decision process (SSMDP) to formulate the multi-step ranking problem. Secondly, we analyze the property of SSMDP and theoretically prove the necessity of maximizing accumulative rewards. Lastly, we propose a novel policy gradient algorithm for learning an optimal ranking policy, which is able to deal with the problem of high reward variance and unbalanced reward distribution of an SSMDP. Experiments are conducted in simulation and TaoBao search engine. The results demonstrate that our algorithm performs much better than online LTR methods, with more than 40% and 30% growth of total transaction amount in the simulation and the real application, respectively.",0
"Abstract  This paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to optimize search engine rankings in e-commerce platforms. We introduce a novel framework that formalizes RL-based ranking as a Markov decision process, where the goal is to maximize user satisfaction by optimizing product relevance scores.

"Agents trained in simulation may make errors in the real world due to mismatches between training and execution environments. These mistakes can be dangerous and difficult to discover because the agent cannot predict them a priori. We propose using oracle feedback to learn a predictive model of these blind spots to reduce costly errors in real-world applications. We focus on blind spots in reinforcement learning (RL) that occur due to incomplete state representation: The agent does not have the appropriate features to represent the true state of the world and thus cannot distinguish among numerous states. We formalize the problem of discovering blind spots in RL as a noisy supervised learning problem with class imbalance. We learn models to predict blind spots in unseen regions of the state space by combining techniques for label aggregation, calibration, and supervised learning. The models take into consideration noise emerging from different forms of oracle feedback, including demonstrations and corrections. We evaluate our approach on two domains and show that it achieves higher predictive performance than baseline methods, and that the learned model can be used to selectively query an oracle at execution time to prevent errors. We also empirically analyze the biases of various feedback types and how they influence the discovery of blind spots.",0
"This research is focused on identifying blind spots in reinforcement learning (RL). RL has become increasingly popular due to its ability to learn optimal policies without explicit supervision. However, recent studies have shown that RL agents can suffer from catastrophic forgetting, fail to generalize beyond their training data, and struggle with multitasking. To tackle these limitations, we propose using intrinsic motivation and meta learning techniques to encourage exploration and improve transferability across tasks. Our experiments show that our approach leads to better performance compared to baseline methods. We hope that our work contributes towards addressing some of the challenges faced by RL algorithms and helps pave the way for more advanced artificial intelligence systems.",1
"In shared autonomy, user input is combined with semi-autonomous control to achieve a common goal. The goal is often unknown ex-ante, so prior work enables agents to infer the goal from user input and assist with the task. Such methods tend to assume some combination of knowledge of the dynamics of the environment, the user's policy given their goal, and the set of possible goals the user might target, which limits their application to real-world scenarios. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for model-free shared autonomy that lifts these assumptions. We use human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning with neural network function approximation to learn an end-to-end mapping from environmental observation and user input to agent action values, with task reward as the only form of supervision. This approach poses the challenge of following user commands closely enough to provide the user with real-time action feedback and thereby ensure high-quality user input, but also deviating from the user's actions when they are suboptimal. We balance these two needs by discarding actions whose values fall below some threshold, then selecting the remaining action closest to the user's input. Controlled studies with users (n = 12) and synthetic pilots playing a video game, and a pilot study with users (n = 4) flying a real quadrotor, demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to assist users with real-time control tasks in which the agent cannot directly access the user's private information through observations, but receives a reward signal and user input that both depend on the user's intent. The agent learns to assist the user without access to this private information, implicitly inferring it from the user's input. This paper is a proof of concept that illustrates the potential for deep reinforcement learning to enable flexible and practical assistive systems.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing autonomous systems that can work collaboratively with humans. These shared autonomy systems aim to strike a balance between human control and machine decision making, allowing for more flexible and effective interaction between users and technology. One promising approach to achieving shared autonomy is through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL allows agents to learn complex policies by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. By leveraging these principles, we propose a framework for designing shared autonomy systems that can adapt to changing situations and prioritize human goals while ensuring safety and efficiency. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our methodology in several challenging domains, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for enhancing collaboration between humans and machines. Overall, our research contributes new insights into the design and implementation of shared autonomy systems, laying the groundwork for future advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics.",1
"We propose a new algorithm, Mean Actor-Critic (MAC), for discrete-action continuous-state reinforcement learning. MAC is a policy gradient algorithm that uses the agent's explicit representation of all action values to estimate the gradient of the policy, rather than using only the actions that were actually executed. We prove that this approach reduces variance in the policy gradient estimate relative to traditional actor-critic methods. We show empirical results on two control domains and on six Atari games, where MAC is competitive with state-of-the-art policy search algorithms.",0
"Here is an example paper based on my previous input that includes an abstract:  Mean Actor-Critic: Solving Reinforcement Learning Problems through Probabilistic Modeling and Online Optimization ======================================================================================================  This paper introduces mean actor-critic (MAC), a new algorithm for reinforcement learning problems. MAC combines probabilistic modeling techniques with online optimization methods to learn effective policies that maximize expected cumulative rewards.  The core of our approach is a novel critic network architecture that represents the state value function as a mixture distribution over functions, capturing both aleatoric uncertainty due to stochastic transitions and epistemic uncertainty due to limited data. This allows us to reason about both types of uncertainties during policy optimization, leading to more robust and reliable solutions.  We instantiate MAC within a deep deterministic policy gradient framework, where we adaptively balance the use of offline pretrained models and online learned models using a Kalman filter. Our method leverages recent advances in variational inference, Bayesian optimization, and trust region optimization algorithms to achieve efficient learning across diverse domains. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MAC against several benchmark tasks from OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo, outperforming state-of-the-art RL baselines such as SAC and TRPO.  Our results show that MAC achieves superior performance due to better handling of exploration-exploitation tradeoffs and improved robustness under changing environments and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, MAC provides interpretable insights into the estimated distributions over value functions and their implications for decision making in uncertain RL scenarios.  Overall, MAC offers a scalable solution for solving challenging continuous control problems by seamlessly integrating domain knowledge, prioritized experience replay, and adaptive uncertainty quantification. With these benefits, MAC has promising applications in robotics, autonomous driving systems, and other real-world tasks requiring safe and sustainable RL performance.",1
"Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating a program consistent with a specification. Recent years have seen proposal of a number of neural approaches for program synthesis, many of which adopt a sequence generation paradigm similar to neural machine translation, in which sequence-to-sequence models are trained to maximize the likelihood of known reference programs. While achieving impressive results, this strategy has two key limitations. First, it ignores Program Aliasing: the fact that many different programs may satisfy a given specification (especially with incomplete specifications such as a few input-output examples). By maximizing the likelihood of only a single reference program, it penalizes many semantically correct programs, which can adversely affect the synthesizer performance. Second, this strategy overlooks the fact that programs have a strict syntax that can be efficiently checked. To address the first limitation, we perform reinforcement learning on top of a supervised model with an objective that explicitly maximizes the likelihood of generating semantically correct programs. For addressing the second limitation, we introduce a training procedure that directly maximizes the probability of generating syntactically correct programs that fulfill the specification. We show that our contributions lead to improved accuracy of the models, especially in cases where the training data is limited.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress over recent years due largely in part to advancements in deep learning techniques like neural networks. These algorithms have been shown to excel at tasks ranging from image classification and natural language processing to even playing games such as chess and Go. One area where there still exists room for improvement, however, is in program synthesis - the automatic generation of code from natural language specifications. This can be incredibly difficult as programs often contain subtle nuances that are hard for machines alone to fully comprehend. Here we present one approach which utilizes a combination of both classical grammatical structures along with reinforcement learning methods. We show experimentally how our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets across programming domains including scientific computing and data manipulation tasks. Our findings suggest that incorporating grammar within reinforcement learning frameworks can result in improved generalization capabilities and more human-like program outputs. With these positive results, it seems that leveraging linguistics along with advanced machine learning techniques may indeed offer an important step forward toward realizing the goal of truly intelligent automation assistants.  ---  In summary, the authors propose a novel method for program synthesis using a hybrid approach combining classical grammars and reinforcement learning techniques. By doing so, they demonstrate greater performance than prior work on multiple challenging programming tasks spanning different fields such as numerical computing and text processing. Overall, their results highlight the potential benefit of marrying traditional linguistics principles with modern machine learning techniques towards achieving better AI systems for solving complex problems.",1
"We study the inverse optimal control problem in social sciences: we aim at learning a user's true cost function from the observed temporal behavior. In contrast to traditional phenomenological works that aim to learn a generative model to fit the behavioral data, we propose a novel variational principle and treat user as a reinforcement learning algorithm, which acts by optimizing his cost function. We first propose a unified KL framework that generalizes existing maximum entropy inverse optimal control methods. We further propose a two-step Wasserstein inverse optimal control framework. In the first step, we compute the optimal measure with a novel mass transport equation. In the second step, we formulate the learning problem as a generative adversarial network. In two real world experiments - recommender systems and social networks, we show that our framework obtains significant performance gains over both existing inverse optimal control methods and point process based generative models.",0
"Our paper presents a novel approach to deep inverse optimal control (IOC) that leverages ideas from Wasserstein distance and adversarial training to optimize unknown nonlinear dynamical systems more effectively than existing methods. We first formulate IOC as a two-player game between a policy optimization model and a critic network trained using least squares regression, which enables us to cast our problem within the framework of generator versus discriminator GANs. By exploiting properties of the optimal transport map associated with the Wasserstein metric, we construct a differentiable surrogate objective function that is optimized alternately with respect to each player. Experimental results on challenging benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art IOC algorithms across multiple metrics such as cost savings, success rates, and trajectory fidelity. Overall, our work represents a significant advance in computational intelligence research by bridging machine learning, artificial intelligence, and operations research communities towards solving complex real-world problems.",1
"In this paper, we explore using deep reinforcement learning for problems with multiple agents. Most existing methods for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning consider only a small number of agents. When the number of agents increases, the dimensionality of the input and control spaces increase as well, and these methods do not scale well. To address this, we propose casting the multi-agent reinforcement learning problem as a distributed optimization problem. Our algorithm assumes that for multi-agent settings, policies of individual agents in a given population live close to each other in parameter space and can be approximated by a single policy. With this simple assumption, we show our algorithm to be extremely effective for reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness against existing comparable approaches on co-operative and competitive tasks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to deep multi-agent reinforcement learning that leverages policy gradients and centralized training to scale up to large problem sizes.

In addition, we provide insights into how scalability can be achieved through careful design choices and analysis of convergence behavior. Overall, this work represents an important step forward towards enabling researchers to tackle larger and more realistic problems using deep RL.",1
"We introduce a method to disentangle controllable and uncontrollable factors of variation by interacting with the world. Disentanglement leads to good representations and is important when applying deep neural networks (DNNs) in fields where explanations are required. This study attempts to improve an existing reinforcement learning (RL) approach to disentangle controllable and uncontrollable factors of variation, because the method lacks a mechanism to represent uncontrollable obstacles. To address this problem, we train two DNNs simultaneously: one that represents the controllable object and another that represents uncontrollable obstacles. For stable training, we applied a pretraining approach using a model robust against uncontrollable obstacles. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can disentangle independently controllable and uncontrollable factors without annotated data.",0
"""Disentangling controllable from uncontrollable factors of variation."" In this study, we present methods that can automatically disentangle controllable from uncontrollable causes of variation, based on a given dataset of input data. Using our methodology, one could ask questions such as: What would have happened if I had made different choices? How well did my intervention work, compared to leaving everything alone? Our results show that many datasets contain strong signals indicating control. We apply our model to several datasets including Atari games, and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the art baselines across the board. These findings suggest potential applications towards causal reasoning in domains where data has already been collected, but cannot yet account for the fact that certain factors were under deliberate human influence rather than natural randomness (like weather). Additionally, our approach shows how existing models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) might be adapted into more powerful tools for investigating counterfactuals and planning based on real-world data. This work opens up new possibilities in artificial intelligence research and beyond; with promising implications ranging from personalized medicine to education to public policy.",1
"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of learning the preferences of an agent from the observations of its behavior on a task. While this problem has been well investigated, the related problem of {\em online} IRL---where the observations are incrementally accrued, yet the demands of the application often prohibit a full rerun of an IRL method---has received relatively less attention. We introduce the first formal framework for online IRL, called incremental IRL (I2RL), and a new method that advances maximum entropy IRL with hidden variables, to this setting. Our formal analysis shows that the new method has a monotonically improving performance with more demonstration data, as well as probabilistically bounded error, both under full and partial observability. Experiments in a simulated robotic application of penetrating a continuous patrol under occlusion shows the relatively improved performance and speed up of the new method and validates the utility of online IRL.",0
"In this paper we present a novel framework for online inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). IRL is a method that allows us to learn the reward function of an agent by observing its behavior, which can then be used to train new agents to achieve similar goals. Traditional methods of IRL assume full knowledge of the environment and require large amounts of data to make accurate predictions. Our proposed framework addresses these limitations by operating in real-time and using a smaller amount of data, making it more suitable for use in real world applications. We demonstrate our approach on a simulated robotic manipulation task, showing that our method is able to accurately predict the underlying reward function despite limited data availability. Furthermore, we provide analysis on the performance of our algorithm as the quantity of available data increases, illustrating the robustness and versatility of our framework. Overall, our results highlight the potential impact of online IRL in a variety of domains where traditional approaches may struggle due to data scarcity.",1
"The framework of reinforcement learning or optimal control provides a mathematical formalization of intelligent decision making that is powerful and broadly applicable. While the general form of the reinforcement learning problem enables effective reasoning about uncertainty, the connection between reinforcement learning and inference in probabilistic models is not immediately obvious. However, such a connection has considerable value when it comes to algorithm design: formalizing a problem as probabilistic inference in principle allows us to bring to bear a wide array of approximate inference tools, extend the model in flexible and powerful ways, and reason about compositionality and partial observability. In this article, we will discuss how a generalization of the reinforcement learning or optimal control problem, which is sometimes termed maximum entropy reinforcement learning, is equivalent to exact probabilistic inference in the case of deterministic dynamics, and variational inference in the case of stochastic dynamics. We will present a detailed derivation of this framework, overview prior work that has drawn on this and related ideas to propose new reinforcement learning and control algorithms, and describe perspectives on future research.",0
"Abstract: This tutorial reviews recent developments in using probabilistic models and inference algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) and control problems. We focus on methods that treat RL as approximate Bayesian reasoning, whereby agents use prior beliefs about their environment, their own model, and other sources of uncertainty to make decisions. These approaches have many benefits over traditional RL algorithms because they allow agents to learn more efficiently from data, adapt to changing environments, and cope with model misspecification. To illustrate these ideas, we provide examples drawn from both robotics and autonomous vehicles, including experiments run using real robots and simulated environments. Finally, we highlight some open challenges in the field that could benefit from further research. Overall, our aim is to give readers a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic RL and control and inspire new work in these areas.",1
"We present a new technique for deep reinforcement learning that automatically detects moving objects and uses the relevant information for action selection. The detection of moving objects is done in an unsupervised way by exploiting structure from motion. Instead of directly learning a policy from raw images, the agent first learns to detect and segment moving objects by exploiting flow information in video sequences. The learned representation is then used to focus the policy of the agent on the moving objects. Over time, the agent identifies which objects are critical for decision making and gradually builds a policy based on relevant moving objects. This approach, which we call Motion-Oriented REinforcement Learning (MOREL), is demonstrated on a suite of Atari games where the ability to detect moving objects reduces the amount of interaction needed with the environment to obtain a good policy. Furthermore, the resulting policy is more interpretable than policies that directly map images to actions or values with a black box neural network. We can gain insight into the policy by inspecting the segmentation and motion of each object detected by the agent. This allows practitioners to confirm whether a policy is making decisions based on sensible information.",0
"In this paper we propose an unsupervised deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called GAIL for video object segmentation. Our model consists of two agents: one imitates human behavior on a given task using state-action value function, while the other generates object masks through pixel control. During training, both agents interact concurrently and cooperatively improve each other’s performance by minimizing their critic loss. Our key contributions can be summarized as follows: i) a new algorithm that allows us to train RL models on large datasets without any manual annotations; ii) a novel method where pretraining on auxiliary tasks helps improve generalization and robustness. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms existing methods on DAVIS dataset, achieving better performance than several supervised baselines with only unsupervised settings.",1
"Meta-learning approaches have been proposed to tackle the few-shot learning problem.Typically, a meta-learner is trained on a variety of tasks in the hopes of being generalizable to new tasks. However, the generalizability on new tasks of a meta-learner could be fragile when it is over-trained on existing tasks during meta-training phase. In other words, the initial model of a meta-learner could be too biased towards existing tasks to adapt to new tasks, especially when only very few examples are available to update the model. To avoid a biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, we propose a novel paradigm of Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML) algorithms. Specifically, we present an entropy-based approach that meta-learns an unbiased initial model with the largest uncertainty over the output labels by preventing it from over-performing in classification tasks. Alternatively, a more general inequality-minimization TAML is presented for more ubiquitous scenarios by directly minimizing the inequality of initial losses beyond the classification tasks wherever a suitable loss can be defined.Experiments on benchmarked datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform compared meta-learning algorithms in both few-shot classification and reinforcement learning tasks.",0
"In recent years, few-shot learning has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training machine learning models to perform well on new tasks with limited data. However, existing methods often require task-specific fine-tuning, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. To address these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning approach that is agnostic to specific tasks, allowing for more efficient and effective adaptation to new environments. Our method builds upon previous work in gradient descent as a model (GDAM), but extends it by incorporating additional components such as batch normalization and a learnable feature extractor. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, our results show that our task-agnostic meta-learning approach has the potential to enable faster and more accurate few-shot learning across a wide range of domains.",1
"In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, besides optimizing the main objective function, an agent must concurrently avoid violating a number of constraints. In particular, besides optimizing performance it is crucial to guarantee the safety of an agent during training as well as deployment (e.g. a robot should avoid taking actions - exploratory or not - which irrevocably harm its hardware). To incorporate safety in RL, we derive algorithms under the framework of constrained Markov decision problems (CMDPs), an extension of the standard Markov decision problems (MDPs) augmented with constraints on expected cumulative costs. Our approach hinges on a novel \emph{Lyapunov} method. We define and present a method for constructing Lyapunov functions, which provide an effective way to guarantee the global safety of a behavior policy during training via a set of local, linear constraints. Leveraging these theoretical underpinnings, we show how to use the Lyapunov approach to systematically transform dynamic programming (DP) and RL algorithms into their safe counterparts. To illustrate their effectiveness, we evaluate these algorithms in several CMDP planning and decision-making tasks on a safety benchmark domain. Our results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing baselines in balancing constraint satisfaction and performance.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to safe reinforcement learning based on the use of Lyapunov functions. We propose a method that guarantees stability and safety by using a Lyapunov function to upper bound the expected return at each state.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing baselines. Overall, our work contributes towards achieving safe reinforcement learning in complex environments.",1
"Good temporal representations are crucial for video understanding, and the state-of-the-art video recognition framework is based on two-stream networks. In such framework, besides the regular ConvNets responsible for RGB frame inputs, a second network is introduced to handle the temporal representation, usually the optical flow (OF). However, OF or other task-oriented flow is computationally costly, and is thus typically pre-computed. Critically, this prevents the two-stream approach from being applied to reinforcement learning (RL) applications such as video game playing, where the next state depends on current state and action choices. Inspired by the early vision systems of mammals and insects, we propose a fast event-driven representation (EDR) that models several major properties of early retinal circuits: (1) logarithmic input response, (2) multi-timescale temporal smoothing to filter noise, and (3) bipolar (ON/OFF) pathways for primitive event detection[12]. Trading off the directional information for fast speed ( 9000 fps), EDR en-ables fast real-time inference/learning in video applications that require interaction between an agent and the world such as game-playing, virtual robotics, and domain adaptation. In this vein, we use EDR to demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for Atari games, something that has not been possible with pre-computed OF. Moreover, with UCF-101 video action recognition experiments, we show that EDR performs near state-of-the-art in accuracy while achieving a 1,500x speedup in input representation processing, as compared to optical flow.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to event stream processing that enables real-time video recognition and reinforcement learning. Our method uses a retinomorphic event stream (REST) which captures events at their natural timescales without resampling or downsampling. We show how this allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while using significantly fewer parameters than previous methods. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for training deep reinforcement learning agents on challenging tasks such as Atari games. Overall, our work represents an important step towards achieving efficient and accurate event-based recognition and control systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have made huge progress in recent years by leveraging the power of deep neural networks (DNN). Despite the success, deep RL algorithms are known to be sample inefficient, often requiring many rounds of interaction with the environments to obtain satisfactory performance. Recently, episodic memory based RL has attracted attention due to its ability to latch on good actions quickly. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective biologically inspired RL algorithm called Episodic Memory Deep Q-Networks (EMDQN), which leverages episodic memory to supervise an agent during training. Experiments show that our proposed method can lead to better sample efficiency and is more likely to find good policies. It only requires 1/5 of the interactions of DQN to achieve many state-of-the-art performances on Atari games, significantly outperforming regular DQN and other episodic memory based RL algorithms.",0
"This paper introduces a new type of deep reinforcement learning agent called an episodic memory DQN (EMDQN). EMDQN combines two state-of-the-art techniques: episodic memory and deep Q networks. Unlike traditional DQNs which forget old experiences quickly, the episodic memory component allows the agent to store important past experiences and use them to inform future decisions. By combining these components, we have created an agent that can achieve better performance across a range of environments compared to both standard DQNs and other popular state-of-the-art algorithms such as SARSA and double DQN. We evaluate our agent on several benchmark Atari games and show that it outperforms all baseline models in terms of accuracy and stability over time. Our results suggest that incorporating episodic memory into deep reinforcement learning agents has significant potential benefits.",1
"Enabling robots to autonomously navigate complex environments is essential for real-world deployment. Prior methods approach this problem by having the robot maintain an internal map of the world, and then use a localization and planning method to navigate through the internal map. However, these approaches often include a variety of assumptions, are computationally intensive, and do not learn from failures. In contrast, learning-based methods improve as the robot acts in the environment, but are difficult to deploy in the real-world due to their high sample complexity. To address the need to learn complex policies with few samples, we propose a generalized computation graph that subsumes value-based model-free methods and model-based methods, with specific instantiations interpolating between model-free and model-based. We then instantiate this graph to form a navigation model that learns from raw images and is sample efficient. Our simulated car experiments explore the design decisions of our navigation model, and show our approach outperforms single-step and $N$-step double Q-learning. We also evaluate our approach on a real-world RC car and show it can learn to navigate through a complex indoor environment with a few hours of fully autonomous, self-supervised training. Videos of the experiments and code can be found at github.com/gkahn13/gcg",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has been applied to robot navigation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in several environments. However, these methods typically require large amounts of manually collected data and human expertise, which can limit their application in real-world scenarios where labelled training data may be difficult to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose using self-supervision as a means to learn complex behaviors without explicit reward shaping or manual labelling. Our approach leverages generalized computation graphs (GCGs) to enable more flexible representation learning and improved generalization across diverse environments. We evaluate our method on two challenging benchmarks, showing that it significantly outperforms prior self-supervised approaches while being competitive with supervised baselines that require full access to ground truth information. This work paves the way towards enabling robots to autonomously acquire and refine navigation skills through interaction with novel environments.",1
"To improve the quality of computation experience for mobile devices, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a promising paradigm by providing computing capabilities in close proximity within a sliced radio access network (RAN), which supports both traditional communication and MEC services. Nevertheless, the design of computation offloading policies for a virtual MEC system remains challenging. Specifically, whether to execute a computation task at the mobile device or to offload it for MEC server execution should adapt to the time-varying network dynamics. In this paper, we consider MEC for a representative mobile user in an ultra-dense sliced RAN, where multiple base stations (BSs) are available to be selected for computation offloading. The problem of solving an optimal computation offloading policy is modelled as a Markov decision process, where our objective is to maximize the long-term utility performance whereby an offloading decision is made based on the task queue state, the energy queue state as well as the channel qualities between MU and BSs. To break the curse of high dimensionality in state space, we first propose a double deep Q-network (DQN) based strategic computation offloading algorithm to learn the optimal policy without knowing a priori knowledge of network dynamics. Then motivated by the additive structure of the utility function, a Q-function decomposition technique is combined with the double DQN, which leads to novel learning algorithm for the solving of stochastic computation offloading. Numerical experiments show that our proposed learning algorithms achieve a significant improvement in computation offloading performance compared with the baseline policies.",0
"In recent years, virtual edge computing (VEC) has emerged as a promising approach to address the limitations of cloud computing, particularly in terms of latency, bandwidth, cost, and reliability. VEC allows computation tasks to be offloaded from mobile devices to nearby edge servers, reducing latency and improving user experience. However, optimizing computation offloading performance in VEC systems remains challenging due to factors such as network conditions, task characteristics, and server status.  To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an optimized computation offloading framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By using DRL, our proposed framework can learn an optimal decision policy that maximizes computation offloading performance while considering different system parameters and constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through extensive simulations under realistic scenarios, comparing it against state-of-the-art offloading algorithms.  The results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics including execution time, energy consumption, and reliability. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive insights into how DRL behaves under varying environment settings, exploring its strengths and weaknesses in achieving high-quality decisions. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of applying advanced machine learning techniques like DRL to enhance VEC performance and pave the way for future research directions in this field.",1
"We formulate the problem of sampling and recovering clustered graph signal as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. This formulation lends naturally to learning sampling strategies using the well-known gradient MAB algorithm. In particular, the sampling strategy is represented as a probability distribution over the individual arms of the MAB and optimized using gradient ascent. Some illustrative numerical experiments indicate that the sampling strategies based on the gradient MAB algorithm outperform existing sampling methods.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to graph signal sampling using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the problem as a sequential decision making process where the agent selects one node at each time step to sample based on the current state of the graph and its past observations. Our model uses a deep neural network to learn the value function that estimates the expected reward obtained by selecting each node under different states. By optimizing the value function through RL algorithms, our method can efficiently explore and identify important nodes in a large graph, leading to high-quality samplings tailored to specific applications. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional uniform and randomized methods across several domains such as image processing and social network analysis. This work advances the understanding of graph signal sampling and has promising implications in related fields like data mining and pattern recognition.",1
"A common problem in Machine Learning and statistics consists in detecting whether the current sample in a stream of data belongs to the same distribution as previous ones, is an isolated outlier or inaugurates a new distribution of data. We present a hierarchical Bayesian algorithm that aims at learning a time-specific approximate posterior distribution of the parameters describing the distribution of the data observed. We derive the update equations of the variational parameters of the approximate posterior at each time step for models from the exponential family, and show that these updates find interesting correspondents in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this perspective, our model can be seen as a hierarchical RL algorithm that learns a posterior distribution according to a certain stability confidence that is, in turn, learned according to its own stability confidence. Finally, we show some applications of our generic model, first in a RL context, next with an adaptive Bayesian Autoregressive model, and finally in the context of Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm called Hierarchical Adaptive Forgetting Variational Filter (HAFV) which can handle high dimensionality datasets effectively. We demonstrate HAFV’s performance on several image reconstruction tasks. Firstly we compare the results of HAFV against state of the art methods, such as DDNet. Secondly we apply HAFV in low resolution situations where no previous method has been able to compete with real world imaging techniques like MRI machines. Last but not least we take advantage of HAFV’s ability to quickly produce images and train another model directly from these generated samples without any further processing. Overall our work shows that by utilizing the strengths of hierarchical representation and adaptive forgetting while keeping computational complexity at bay ,we have developed an algorithm superior to all current alternatives. The Hierarchical Adaptive Forgetting Variational Filter (HAFV) is a novel algorithm designed to tackle the challenge posed by high dimensionality datasets in image reconstruction tasks. In comparison studies across several benchmark datasets, HAFV outperformed existing approaches including the widely used DDNet method, particularly in low resolution scenarios where traditional imaging technology falls short. Furthermore, HAFV's efficiency allows for rapid generation of synthetic training data that can be leveraged to enhance downstream models, demonstrating the versatility of this innovative approach.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) agents performing complex tasks must be able to remember observations and actions across sizable time intervals. This is especially true during the initial learning stages, when exploratory behaviour can increase the delay between specific actions and their effects. Many new or popular approaches for learning these distant correlations employ backpropagation through time (BPTT), but this technique requires storing observation traces long enough to span the interval between cause and effect. Besides memory demands, learning dynamics like vanishing gradients and slow convergence due to infrequent weight updates can reduce BPTT's practicality; meanwhile, although online recurrent network learning is a developing topic, most approaches are not efficient enough to use as replacements. We propose a simple, effective memory strategy that can extend the window over which BPTT can learn without requiring longer traces. We explore this approach empirically on a few tasks and discuss its implications.",0
"This research examines how low-pass recurrent neural networks can enhance our ability to discover connections across multiple orders of magnitude. By combining both short-term and long-term perspectives on data, we show that these models enable us to better understand complex relationships within seemingly unrelated domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments on challenging real-world datasets from climate science and human language processing tasks. Our findings highlight their potential as a general tool for discovering hidden structures in temporal data, thus paving the way towards new scientific breakthroughs across diverse fields.",1
"Learning locomotion skills is a challenging problem. To generate realistic and smooth locomotion, existing methods use motion capture, finite state machines or morphology-specific knowledge to guide the motion generation algorithms. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for the automatic creation of locomotion control. Indeed, a standard benchmark for DRL is to automatically create a running controller for a biped character from a simple reward function. Although several different DRL algorithms can successfully create a running controller, the resulting motions usually look nothing like a real runner. This paper takes a minimalist learning approach to the locomotion problem, without the use of motion examples, finite state machines, or morphology-specific knowledge. We introduce two modifications to the DRL approach that, when used together, produce locomotion behaviors that are symmetric, low-energy, and much closer to that of a real person. First, we introduce a new term to the loss function (not the reward function) that encourages symmetric actions. Second, we introduce a new curriculum learning method that provides modulated physical assistance to help the character with left/right balance and forward movement. The algorithm automatically computes appropriate assistance to the character and gradually relaxes this assistance, so that eventually the character learns to move entirely without help. Because our method does not make use of motion capture data, it can be applied to a variety of character morphologies. We demonstrate locomotion controllers for the lower half of a biped, a full humanoid, a quadruped, and a hexapod. Our results show that learned policies are able to produce symmetric, low-energy gaits. In addition, speed-appropriate gait patterns emerge without any guidance from motion examples or contact planning.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning symmetric and low-energy locomotion using deep reinforcement learning. We define two new reward functions that respectively encourage symmetry and reduce energy consumption during training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Compared to previous methods, our approach requires significantly fewer interactions between the agent and environment, enabling faster convergence times. Additionally, we provide ablation studies comparing traditional RL objectives against the proposed ones in order to demonstrate their efficacy. In summary, our work demonstrates how to learn more efficient motions by simultaneously minimizing energy usage while improving motion quality through symmetrical joint rotations.",1
"In recent years, attention has been focused on the relationship between black-box optimiza- tion problem and reinforcement learning problem. In this research, we propose the Mirror Descent Search (MDS) algorithm which is applicable both for black box optimization prob- lems and reinforcement learning problems. Our method is based on the mirror descent method, which is a general optimization algorithm. The contribution of this research is roughly twofold. We propose two essential algorithms, called MDS and Accelerated Mirror Descent Search (AMDS), and two more approximate algorithms: Gaussian Mirror Descent Search (G-MDS) and Gaussian Accelerated Mirror Descent Search (G-AMDS). This re- search shows that the advanced methods developed in the context of the mirror descent research can be applied to reinforcement learning problem. We also clarify the relationship between an existing reinforcement learning algorithm and our method. With two evaluation experiments, we show our proposed algorithms converge faster than some state-of-the-art methods.",0
"The algorithm we describe here applies to both problems on fixed graphs where the regularizer K may depend on x_i^k only through the coordinates f(x_i) (we shall use mirror descent search to refer to such algorithms), as well as to problems involving randomization described above. Furthermore, one can replace the gradient step by other update rules which approximately minimize the function g_k(z). In particular, our methods apply to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its accelerations.",1
"We explore building generative neural network models of popular reinforcement learning environments. Our world model can be trained quickly in an unsupervised manner to learn a compressed spatial and temporal representation of the environment. By using features extracted from the world model as inputs to an agent, we can train a very compact and simple policy that can solve the required task. We can even train our agent entirely inside of its own hallucinated dream generated by its world model, and transfer this policy back into the actual environment.

"""World Models"" discusses the concept of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) research, particularly how they have evolved over time and their role in current AI systems. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using world models as a way to represent knowledge and perceptions of the environment, allowing machines to reason about objects, actions, and events in the physical world. This approach has shown promising results in several areas, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, building accurate and flexible world models remains challenging due to factors such as uncertainty and complexity inherent in real-world environments.  The paper first provides an overview of early work on world modeling that led to modern approaches. Then, it highlights some key advances in world models, including deep learning techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs), probabilistic programming, and hierarchical Bayesian inference. Next, it examines potential applications of world models, focusing on robotics, conversational agents, and autonomous vehicles, among others. Finally, the paper identifies future directions and open challenges in world modeling research, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation methods, improved theoretical foundations, and better integration with human cognition. Overall, the aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in world models and stimulate further progress in this exciting field at the intersection of AI and cognitive science.",1
"Teaching plays a very important role in our society, by spreading human knowledge and educating our next generations. A good teacher will select appropriate teaching materials, impact suitable methodologies, and set up targeted examinations, according to the learning behaviors of the students. In the field of artificial intelligence, however, one has not fully explored the role of teaching, and pays most attention to machine \emph{learning}. In this paper, we argue that equal attention, if not more, should be paid to teaching, and furthermore, an optimization framework (instead of heuristics) should be used to obtain good teaching strategies. We call this approach `learning to teach'. In the approach, two intelligent agents interact with each other: a student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional machine learning algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate data, loss function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to optimize its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an example, and show that by using the learning to teach techniques, we are able to use much less training data and fewer iterations to achieve almost the same accuracy for different kinds of DNN models (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) under various machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification and text understanding).",0
"""Learning to teach"" refers to the process by which individuals acquire knowledge and skills related to teaching and educational instruction. This paper explores the different approaches that can be used to learn how to teach effectively and efficiently, as well as some of the key factors that influence learning outcomes. Additionally, we discuss the importance of reflective practice, feedback, and continuous improvement in developing strong teaching abilities. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research directions on this topic.  Teaching is a complex task that requires significant expertise and experience. Effective teachers possess both content knowledge and pedagogical skill, allowing them to engage students and promote academic growth. To become proficient at teaching, educators need to develop their understanding of subject matter, instructional methods, and classroom management strategies. Several approaches exist for acquiring these capabilities, including formal education programs, mentorship opportunities, peer observation, self-reflection, and professional development activities.  In this study, we examine several relevant literature sources and identify some common themes associated with successful teacher preparation experiences. These themes include a focus on authentic tasks and contexts, collaborative relationships with peers, personalized support from instructors, attention to diversity issues, and sustained reflection on practice. We propose that by incorporating these elements into pre-service training programs and continuing professional development initiatives, educators may enhance their ability to facilitate student learning.  Feedback is another important factor in teacher learning processes. Feedback from colleagues, administrators, parents, and students can serve as valuable resources for improving instructional effectiveness. However, providing constructive feedback requires careful consideration of timing, tone, specificity, and prioritization of concerns. Giving frequent, accurate, actionable suggestions can encourage teacher pr",1
"Multi-shot pedestrian re-identification problem is at the core of surveillance video analysis. It matches two tracks of pedestrians from different cameras. In contrary to existing works that aggregate single frames features by time series model such as recurrent neural network, in this paper, we propose an interpretable reinforcement learning based approach to this problem. Particularly, we train an agent to verify a pair of images at each time. The agent could choose to output the result (same or different) or request another pair of images to verify (unsure). By this way, our model implicitly learns the difficulty of image pairs, and postpone the decision when the model does not accumulate enough evidence. Moreover, by adjusting the reward for unsure action, we can easily trade off between speed and accuracy. In three open benchmarks, our method are competitive with the state-of-the-art methods while only using 3% to 6% images. These promising results demonstrate that our method is favorable in both efficiency and performance.",0
"In recent years, pedestrian re-identification has emerged as a key research area in computer vision, aimed at identifying individuals across multiple cameras installed in different locations. While numerous approaches have been proposed, few have focused on integrating high-level reasoning and decision making into the process. This paper introduces a new framework that incorporates sequential decision making principles, enabling multi-shot person re-identification by iteratively selecting informative views and capturing images to minimize errors. Our approach leverages deep reinforcement learning techniques to model the environment and determine optimal viewpoints under constraints such as visibility and camera placements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.",1
"Current reinforcement learning (RL) methods can successfully learn single tasks but often generalize poorly to modest perturbations in task domain or training procedure. In this work, we present a decoupled learning strategy for RL that creates a shared representation space where knowledge can be robustly transferred. We separate learning the task representation, the forward dynamics, the inverse dynamics and the reward function of the domain, and show that this decoupling improves performance within the task, transfers well to changes in dynamics and reward, and can be effectively used for online planning. Empirical results show good performance in both continuous and discrete RL domains.",0
"Title: ""Decoupled Learning for Efficient Domain Adaptation""  Domain adaptation aims to enable deep learning models trained on source domains to generalize better to new target domains.

In this work, we present a novel approach that decouples dynamics and reward functions during policy transfer. By doing so, our method provides improved sample efficiency and enables effective adaptations across diverse environments. Our results demonstrate the potential of decoupled learning for robust and efficient domain adaptation in reinforcement learning tasks.",1
"How would you search for a unique, fashionable shoe that a friend wore and you want to buy, but you didn't take a picture? Existing approaches propose interactive image search as a promising venue. However, they either entrust the user with taking the initiative to provide informative feedback, or give all control to the system which determines informative questions to ask. Instead, we propose a mixed-initiative framework where both the user and system can be active participants, depending on whose initiative will be more beneficial for obtaining high-quality search results. We develop a reinforcement learning approach which dynamically decides which of three interaction opportunities to give to the user: drawing a sketch, providing free-form attribute feedback, or answering attribute-based questions. By allowing these three options, our system optimizes both the informativeness and exploration capabilities allowing faster image retrieval. We outperform three baselines on three datasets and extensive experimental settings.",0
"Title: ""Improving Image Retrieval with Mixed Initiative and Multimodal Feedback""  Abstract: This research aims to enhance image retrieval systems by incorporating mixed initiative search techniques and multimodal feedback mechanisms. Traditional image retrieval approaches rely on single modalities such as text queries or visual features, which can limit their effectiveness in complex search tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach that integrates multiple modalities (text, images, audio) into a unified framework, enabling users to interactively refine their searches through both manual input and automated recommendations. Our system utilizes deep learning algorithms to automatically generate semantic representations from user inputs and provide contextually relevant suggestions based on both content similarity and metadata correlation. Evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly improves retrieval accuracy compared to baseline models, reducing error rates up to 67% for ambiguous queries. Furthermore, experimental analysis shows that users highly prefer our interface design and appreciate the flexibility provided by multi-modality interactions. Ultimately, our work contributes to developing more intuitive and effective ways for users to retrieve desired images using diverse sources of information.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) recently emerged as one of the most competitive approaches for learning in sequential decision making problems with fully observable environments, e.g., computer Go. However, very little work has been done in deep RL to handle partially observable environments. We propose a new architecture called Action-specific Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADRQN) to enhance learning performance in partially observable domains. Actions are encoded by a fully connected layer and coupled with a convolutional observation to form an action-observation pair. The time series of action-observation pairs are then integrated by an LSTM layer that learns latent states based on which a fully connected layer computes Q-values as in conventional Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new architecture in several partially observable domains, including flickering Atari games.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to solving complex decision making problems under uncertainty, such as those encountered in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). However, training deep neural networks to solve these tasks remains challenging due to the high dimensionality of state spaces and the difficulty of exploring large action spaces efficiently. This work presents a new method that addresses these issues by using proximal policy optimization to improve both the accuracy and stability of learned policies. Our approach combines temporal difference learning with Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the underlying value function, allowing us to optimize policy parameters directly without relying on policy gradient methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through experiments on several benchmark domains, showing significant improvements over previous methods in terms of both sample efficiency and final performance. These results have important implications for developing intelligent agents capable of operating autonomously in real world environments.",1
"For many applications with limited computation, communication, storage and energy resources, there is an imperative need of computer vision methods that could select an informative subset of the input video for efficient processing at or near real time. In the literature, there are two relevant groups of approaches: generating a trailer for a video or fast-forwarding while watching/processing the video. The first group is supported by video summarization techniques, which require processing of the entire video to select an important subset for showing to users. In the second group, current fast-forwarding methods depend on either manual control or automatic adaptation of playback speed, which often do not present an accurate representation and may still require processing of every frame. In this paper, we introduce FastForwardNet (FFNet), a reinforcement learning agent that gets inspiration from video summarization and does fast-forwarding differently. It is an online framework that automatically fast-forwards a video and presents a representative subset of frames to users on the fly. It does not require processing the entire video, but just the portion that is selected by the fast-forward agent, which makes the process very computationally efficient. The online nature of our proposed method also enables the users to begin fast-forwarding at any point of the video. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can provide better representation of the input video with much less processing requirement.",0
"This paper presents FFNet (Video Fast-Forwarding via Reinforcement Learning), which is a new method for efficient fast forwarding through videos by utilizing reinforcement learning. With the ability to speed up video playback without audio distortion, FFNet provides users with increased control over their viewing experience while preserving video quality. By leveraging deep neural networks trained using reinforcement learning techniques, we demonstrate that our approach can effectively learn the optimal fast forwarding speeds for different types of content, allowing users to quickly navigate through videos they have already watched or to scan unfamiliar ones. We evaluate our model on several datasets including instructional videos, movies, and TV shows and show that FFNet achieves significantly better results compared to state-of-the-art methods such as frame skipping and variable playback rate. Our contributions in this work provide significant improvements in user satisfaction through enhanced video navigation capabilities, ultimately leading towards more productive and enjoyable viewing experiences.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has shown its success in game playing. However, 2.5D fighting games would be a challenging task to handle due to ambiguity in visual appearances like height or depth of the characters. Moreover, actions in such games typically involve particular sequential action orders, which also makes the network design very difficult. Based on the network of Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), we create an OpenAI-gym-like gaming environment with the game of Little Fighter 2 (LF2), and present a novel A3C+ network for learning RL agents. The introduced model includes a Recurrent Info network, which utilizes game-related info features with recurrent layers to observe combo skills for fighting. In the experiments, we consider LF2 in different settings, which successfully demonstrates the use of our proposed model for learning 2.5D fighting games.",0
"In this work we propose an RL algorithm capable of playing classic 2D fighting games played on an arcade cabinet with an LCD screen overlay which can display additional graphics and animations. Previous efforts were limited by their inability to accurately model spatio-temporal game state representations of the game screen, leading us to develop a novel method called SAC2DRL that combines spatial modulation modules with asynchronous actor updates for efficient data parallelism across multiple GPUs. We use Asymmetric Montezuma’s Revenge (a recently released benchmark) as our main evaluation environment but report results on popular open source games like PunchOut!! (as trained by OpenAI), and demonstrate strong single agent performance compared against human expert play on a real arcade machine under tournament rules. Our contributions extend beyond 2.5D video games as they inform future progress toward General Video Game Level agents; the lessons learned here form a foundation for future development into richer multiplayer domains where high level strategic reasoning is necessary for success alongside basic action selection competence.

"In reinforcement learning, temporal difference (TD) is the most direct algorithm to learn the value function of a policy. For large or infinite state spaces, exact representations of the value function are usually not available, and it must be approximated by a function in some parametric family.   However, with \emph{nonlinear} parametric approximations (such as neural networks), TD is not guaranteed to converge to a good approximation of the true value function within the family, and is known to diverge even in relatively simple cases. TD lacks an interpretation as a stochastic gradient descent of an error between the true and approximate value functions, which would provide such guarantees.   We prove that approximate TD is a gradient descent provided the current policy is \emph{reversible}. This holds even with nonlinear approximations.   A policy with transition probabilities $P(s,s')$ between states is reversible if there exists a function $\mu$ over states such that $\frac{P(s,s')}{P(s',s)}=\frac{\mu(s')}{\mu(s)}$. In particular, every move can be undone with some probability. This condition is restrictive; it is satisfied, for instance, for a navigation problem in any unoriented graph.   In this case, approximate TD is exactly a gradient descent of the \emph{Dirichlet norm}, the norm of the difference of \emph{gradients} between the true and approximate value functions. The Dirichlet norm also controls the bias of approximate policy gradient. These results hold even with no decay factor ($\gamma=1$) and do not rely on contractivity of the Bellman operator, thus proving stability of TD even with $\gamma=1$ for reversible policies.",0
"In order to approximate temporal difference learning (TDL) using gradient descent (GD), we begin by showing that TDL can be formulated as maximizing the expected value function for all states under our current policy. We then proceed by approximating this objective with respect to our policy parameters, which leads us to derive a natural update rule analogous to GD. Our approach, called Approximate Temporal Difference Learning (ATDL), allows for more flexibility than traditional TDL in terms of choice of target functions. This makes it particularly well suited for use cases where the desired behavior requires reversible policies, such as those used in game playing and robotics. Through extensive experimental evaluations, ATDL has been shown to outperform other popular approximation methods, including Q-learning, SARSA, and actor-critic models.",1
"Multimodal wearable sensor data classification plays an important role in ubiquitous computing and has a wide range of applications in scenarios from healthcare to entertainment. However, most existing work in this field employs domain-specific approaches and is thus ineffective in complex sit- uations where multi-modality sensor data are col- lected. Moreover, the wearable sensor data are less informative than the conventional data such as texts or images. In this paper, to improve the adapt- ability of such classification methods across differ- ent application domains, we turn this classification task into a game and apply a deep reinforcement learning scheme to deal with complex situations dynamically. Additionally, we introduce a selective attention mechanism into the reinforcement learn- ing scheme to focus on the crucial dimensions of the data. This mechanism helps to capture extra information from the signal and thus it is able to significantly improve the discriminative power of the classifier. We carry out several experiments on three wearable sensor datasets and demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed approach compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.",0

"Recently experience replay is widely used in various deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, in this paper we rethink the utility of experience replay. It introduces a new hyper-parameter, the memory buffer size, which needs carefully tuning. However unfortunately the importance of this new hyper-parameter has been underestimated in the community for a long time. In this paper we did a systematic empirical study of experience replay under various function representations. We showcase that a large replay buffer can significantly hurt the performance. Moreover, we propose a simple O(1) method to remedy the negative influence of a large replay buffer. We showcase its utility in both simple grid world and challenging domains like Atari games.",0
"In the paper we discuss how experience replay can significantly improve performance on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tasks by providing a form of delayed, selective feedback. We analyze several algorithms that utilize experience replay in a DQN framework, as well as investigate the impact of different hyperparameters such as batch size and randomness on overall performance. Additionally, we compare two commonly used memory schedules: uniform sampling from the whole buffer and prioritized replay based on TD error. Our experiments demonstrate that using experience replay improves performance compared to models without replay across multiple benchmark Atari games. Furthermore, our study shows that both memory schedules provide equivalent results, but prioritizing high priority experiences leads to more stable convergence and better final scores on certain Atari games. Overall, our work provides insights into ways to optimize experience replay usage in DRL agents.",1
"We propose a metalearning approach for learning gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The idea is to evolve a differentiable loss function, such that an agent, which optimizes its policy to minimize this loss, will achieve high rewards. The loss is parametrized via temporal convolutions over the agent's experience. Because this loss is highly flexible in its ability to take into account the agent's history, it enables fast task learning. Empirical results show that our evolved policy gradient algorithm (EPG) achieves faster learning on several randomized environments compared to an off-the-shelf policy gradient method. We also demonstrate that EPG's learned loss can generalize to out-of-distribution test time tasks, and exhibits qualitatively different behavior from other popular metalearning algorithms.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has become increasingly popular as a means of training agents that can perform complex tasks in uncertain and dynamic environments. One key challenge in using deep reinforcement learning is the tendency for policies learned by gradient ascent on objective functions to suffer from problems such as poor interpretability, brittleness to perturbations, and instability during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a new method called ""Evolved Policy Gradients"" (EPG) which combines elements of evolutionary computation with policy gradients.  In EPG, we first use gradient ascent to initialize a population of candidate policies, and then apply genetic operators like mutation and crossover to generate a set of new policies that explore the search space more thoroughly. We evaluate each policy in the population based on how well it performs in the environment, and select the fittest individuals to form the next generation. By doing so, we encourage exploration of diverse solutions and discourage overfitting to noisy reward signals.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of EPG on several challenging continuous control benchmarks and show that our approach leads to significantly better performance than vanilla policy gradients, especially in cases where strong baselines fail to converge. Moreover, we analyze the resulting policies and find that they often exhibit desirable properties such as robustness and compositional structure.  Overall, EPG offers a novel way to combine the advantages of model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, and could potentially open up new opportunities for designing algorithms that learn intelligent behavior through interaction with their environments.",1
"Standard model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms sample a new initial state for each trial, allowing them to optimize policies that can perform well even in highly stochastic environments. However, problems that exhibit considerable initial state variation typically produce high-variance gradient estimates for model-free RL, making direct policy or value function optimization challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that instead partitions the initial state space into ""slices"", and optimizes an ensemble of policies, each on a different slice. The ensemble is gradually unified into a single policy that can succeed on the whole state space. This approach, which we term divide-and-conquer RL, is able to solve complex tasks where conventional deep RL methods are ineffective. Our results show that divide-and-conquer RL greatly outperforms conventional policy gradient methods on challenging grasping, manipulation, and locomotion tasks, and exceeds the performance of a variety of prior methods. Videos of policies learned by our algorithm can be viewed at http://bit.ly/dnc-rl",0
"Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence due to its ability to learn optimal policies directly from raw data without relying on domain knowledge or hand-engineered features. However, many RL algorithms suffer from high sample complexity, i.e., they need millions or even billions of interactions with their environments to achieve reasonable performance. In order to overcome these issues, we propose a new method called ""Divide-and-Conquer"" which breaks down large Markov decision processes into smaller subproblems that can be solved using offline value iteration. We show through extensive experiments on benchmark control tasks that our algorithm converges significantly faster than state-of-the art RL methods while achieving comparable or better performance. Our results indicate that divide-and-conquer RL could lead to more efficient exploration strategies in complex real-world domains where sample efficiency is crucial. Keywords: reinforcement learning, sample complexity, explore vs exploit tradeoff, dividing and combining operators This paper proposes a new approach to reinforcement learning based on the divide-and-conquer principle. The main challenge addressed by the authors is the high sample complexity of current RL algorithms, which can require millions or even billions of interactions with the environment before converging to good solutions. To address this issue, the proposed method splits large Markov decision processes into smaller subproblems, which are then solved using traditional offline value iteration techniques. Through experimental evaluation on several benchmark control tasks, the authors demonstrate that their approach converges faster and performs at least as well as state-ofthe-art RL methods. Overall, this work represents an important step towards more effective exploration strategies in complex real-world domains where sample efficiency is critical. Further research may investigate whether similar principles can be applied to other types of machine learning problems or optimize the specific division and combination operations used in this work.",1
"In deep reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, an efficient exploration mechanism should be able to encourage an agent to take actions that lead to less frequent states which may yield higher accumulative future return. However, both knowing about the future and evaluating the frequentness of states are non-trivial tasks, especially for deep RL domains, where a state is represented by high-dimensional image frames. In this paper, we propose a novel informed exploration framework for deep RL, where we build the capability for an RL agent to predict over the future transitions and evaluate the frequentness for the predicted future frames in a meaningful manner. To this end, we train a deep prediction model to predict future frames given a state-action pair, and a convolutional autoencoder model to hash over the seen frames. In addition, to utilize the counts derived from the seen frames to evaluate the frequentness for the predicted frames, we tackle the challenge of matching the predicted future frames and their corresponding seen frames at the latent feature level. In this way, we derive a reliable metric for evaluating the novelty of the future direction pointed by each action, and hence inform the agent to explore the least frequent one.",0
"Our paper addresses the challenge of designing deep reinforcement learning agents that can make informed decisions based on predictions about future outcomes. We propose a novel approach called ""hashing over predicted future frames"" (HPFF), which leverages recent advances in computer vision and natural language processing to preprocess high-dimensional state representations into lower-dimensional discrete descriptors. These descriptors capture key features of the environment and allow the agent to rapidly explore and evaluate different actions. Our experiments show that HPFF significantly improves the performance of several benchmark RL algorithms across a range of tasks, including Atari games and text-based navigation. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of using semantic hash functions to enhance exploration strategies in deep RL, paving the way for more efficient and informed decision making by artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Approximate linear programming (ALP) represents one of the major algorithmic families to solve large-scale Markov decision processes (MDP). In this work, we study a primal-dual formulation of the ALP, and develop a scalable, model-free algorithm called bilinear $\pi$ learning for reinforcement learning when a sampling oracle is provided. This algorithm enjoys a number of advantages. First, it adopts (bi)linear models to represent the high-dimensional value function and state-action distributions, using given state and action features. Its run-time complexity depends on the number of features, not the size of the underlying MDPs. Second, it operates in a fully online fashion without having to store any sample, thus having minimal memory footprint. Third, we prove that it is sample-efficient, solving for the optimal policy to high precision with a sample complexity linear in the dimension of the parameter space.",0
"This research proposes a new approach for efficient bilinear learning in reinforcement learning algorithms called ""Scalable Bilinear $\pi$ Learning using State and Action Features."" Our method addresses the computational challenge of calculating and storing large amounts of bilinear features by leveraging state and action feature mappings that can reduce both computation time and memory usage while improving policy quality. To achieve this, we first decompose the problem into two separate problems: one which models only changes in the state space and another which models only actions. We then apply these decomposed solutions back together and use them as input to our neural network based RL algorithm. Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements over current state-of-the art methods on several benchmark tasks.",1
Policy gradient methods are widely used in reinforcement learning algorithms to search for better policies in the parameterized policy space. They do gradient search in the policy space and are known to converge very slowly. Nesterov developed an accelerated gradient search algorithm for convex optimization problems. This has been recently extended for non-convex and also stochastic optimization. We use Nesterov's acceleration for policy gradient search in the well-known actor-critic algorithm and show the convergence using ODE method. We tested this algorithm on a scheduling problem. Here an incoming job is scheduled into one of the four queues based on the queue lengths. We see from experimental results that algorithm using Nesterov's acceleration has significantly better performance compared to algorithm which do not use acceleration. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time Nesterov's acceleration has been used with actor-critic algorithm.,0

Gotcha involves creating random maps from simple rules, making generalization hard due to unseen combinations, which traditional metrics like average episodic reward cannot capture. Our results show that state-of-the-art agents fail even at low levels of complexity, while algorithms incorporating equivariant features perform better, but still have limitations. Thus we motivate further research into achieving robust generalization under adversarial mapping conditions for more realistic scenarios where prior knowledge may not apply. In conclusion, we demonstrate the importance of considering diverse aspects of problem structure in studying generalization, suggesting multiple perspectives should be considered to fully comprehend how well RL can excel in open worlds. ----- Please critique and edit so I can submit this paper!",1
"Projective simulation (PS) is a model for intelligent agents with a deliberation capacity that is based on episodic memory. The model has been shown to provide a flexible framework for constructing reinforcement-learning agents, and it allows for quantum mechanical generalization, which leads to a speed-up in deliberation time. PS agents have been applied successfully in the context of complex skill learning in robotics, and in the design of state-of-the-art quantum experiments. In this paper, we study the performance of projective simulation in two benchmarking problems in navigation, namely the grid world and the mountain car problem. The performance of PS is compared to standard tabular reinforcement learning approaches, Q-learning and SARSA. Our comparison demonstrates that the performance of PS and standard learning approaches are qualitatively and quantitatively similar, while it is much easier to choose optimal model parameters in case of projective simulation, with a reduced computational effort of one to two orders of magnitude. Our results show that the projective simulation model stands out for its simplicity in terms of the number of model parameters, which makes it simple to set up the learning agent in unknown task environments.",0
"This study benchmarks the performance of projective simulation as a planning method for navigation tasks. We compare results obtained using a state-of-the-art real-time Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner against those obtained using projective simulation on six standard domains from the OpenAI Gym environment. Our experiments show that projective simulation consistently outperforms MCTS across all six domains, both in terms of raw scores achieved and speed of convergence. These findings suggest that projective simulation may offer a promising alternative to traditional planning methods for many navigation tasks.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL) has made several breakthroughs in recent years in applications ranging from complex control tasks in unmanned vehicles to game playing. Despite their success, deep RL still lacks several important capacities of human intelligence, such as transfer learning, abstraction and interpretability. Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning (DSRL) seeks to incorporate such capacities to deep Q-networks (DQN) by learning a relevant symbolic representation prior to using Q-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of DSRL, which we call Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense (SRL+CS), offering a better balance between generalization and specialization, inspired by principles of common sense when assigning rewards and aggregating Q-values. Experiments reported in this paper show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a deterministic environment and tested in a random environment, SRL+CS achieves nearly 100% average accuracy compared to DSRL's 70% and DQN's 50% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of near perfect zero-shot transfer learning using Reinforcement Learning.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful approach to artificial intelligence, allowing machines to learn from trial and error by maximizing reward signals. However, traditional RL approaches lack access to commonsense knowledge, which can greatly limit their performance on real-world tasks. This paper proposes a new framework called symbolic RL that incorporates common sense reasoning into RL algorithms, enabling agents to make more informed decisions based on rich representations of their environment. By combining symbolic reasoning methods such as logical deduction and rule inheritance with deep neural networks used in modern RL models, we aim to build agents that exhibit human-like understanding and decision making abilities. Our proposed methodology includes designing a special architecture to integrate symbolic knowledge into existing deep reinforcement learning models and developing training procedures suitable for learning both from explicit rules and raw sensorimotor data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple domains, showing improved performance over state-of-the-art baseline methods. Overall, this work represents an important step towards building intelligent agents capable of general problem solving under uncertain conditions and opens up exciting opportunities for future research at the intersection of RL and formal reasoning.",1
"A critical and challenging problem in reinforcement learning is how to learn the state-action value function from the experience replay buffer and simultaneously keep sample efficiency and faster convergence to a high quality solution. In prior works, transitions are uniformly sampled at random from the replay buffer or sampled based on their priority measured by temporal-difference (TD) error. However, these approaches do not fully take into consideration the intrinsic characteristics of transition distribution in the state space and could result in redundant and unnecessary TD updates, slowing down the convergence of the learning procedure. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel state distribution-aware sampling method to balance the replay times for transitions with skew distribution, which takes into account both the occurrence frequencies of transitions and the uncertainty of state-action values. Consequently, our approach could reduce the unnecessary TD updates and increase the TD updates for state-action value with more uncertainty, making the experience replay more effective and efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted on both classic control tasks and Atari 2600 games based on OpenAI gym platform and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the standard DQN approach.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been studying how to make use of deep learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL). One key challenge faced by DRL algorithms is that they require large amounts of data from which to learn. As a result, sampling has become an important topic within the field. In State Distribution-aware Sampling for Deep Q-learning, we introduce a new methodology for generating samples using distribution-awareness in order to improve the performance of DQNs. We demonstrate through experiments on six Atari games that our proposed algorithm can provide significant improvements over traditional uniform random sampling. Our work shows promise for further improving sample efficiency in the future by more intelligent use of samples in training deep neural networks like DQNs. We believe that our approach could potentially benefit other applications beyond just Atari game playing as well.",1
"This work adopts the very successful distributional perspective on reinforcement learning and adapts it to the continuous control setting. We combine this within a distributed framework for off-policy learning in order to develop what we call the Distributed Distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm, D4PG. We also combine this technique with a number of additional, simple improvements such as the use of $N$-step returns and prioritized experience replay. Experimentally we examine the contribution of each of these individual components, and show how they interact, as well as their combined contributions. Our results show that across a wide variety of simple control tasks, difficult manipulation tasks, and a set of hard obstacle-based locomotion tasks the D4PG algorithm achieves state of the art performance.",0
"One of the key challenges faced by artificial intelligence (AI) agents operating in complex environments is how to efficiently explore their surroundings and learn from their experiences. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to perform well in simple domains, but they often struggle in more realistic settings that require large amounts of time and computational resources to solve. In recent years, several methods have emerged that attempt to address these issues by balancing exploration and exploitation of existing knowledge, such as distributional deterministic policy gradients (DDPG). However, these approaches still suffer from several limitations related to scalability and stability. To tackle these problems, we propose a new algorithm called distributed distributional determi...

"We consider the problem of representing collective behavior of large populations and predicting the evolution of a population distribution over a discrete state space. A discrete time mean field game (MFG) is motivated as an interpretable model founded on game theory for understanding the aggregate effect of individual actions and predicting the temporal evolution of population distributions. We achieve a synthesis of MFG and Markov decision processes (MDP) by showing that a special MFG is reducible to an MDP. This enables us to broaden the scope of mean field game theory and infer MFG models of large real-world systems via deep inverse reinforcement learning. Our method learns both the reward function and forward dynamics of an MFG from real data, and we report the first empirical test of a mean field game model of a real-world social media population.",0
"In order to model large populations we must develop techniques that capture both the individual level interactions as well as the population wide dynamics. One popular approach to achieve this goal has been mean field games (MFGs) which use a system of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, solving MFGs can become computationally expensive due to their size and nonlinearity. We propose using deep learning methods to solve them approximately. To accomplish this we consider approximating solutions of the PDEs by neural networks parameterized by deep learning architectures. Our experiments on traffic flow control demonstrate that our method produces competitive results compared to standard finite difference and spectral solvers and significantly reduces computational cost, making it suitable for real time applications at scale.",1
"One of the most significant bottleneck in training large scale machine learning models on parameter server (PS) is the communication overhead, because it needs to frequently exchange the model gradients between the workers and servers during the training iterations. Gradient quantization has been proposed as an effective approach to reducing the communication volume. One key issue in gradient quantization is setting the number of bits for quantizing the gradients. Small number of bits can significantly reduce the communication overhead while hurts the gradient accuracies, and vise versa. An ideal quantization method would dynamically balance the communication overhead and model accuracy, through adjusting the number bits according to the knowledge learned from the immediate past training iterations. Existing methods, however, quantize the gradients either with fixed number of bits, or with predefined heuristic rules. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive quantization method within the framework of reinforcement learning. The method, referred to as MQGrad, formalizes the selection of quantization bits as actions in a Markov decision process (MDP) where the MDP states records the information collected from the past optimization iterations (e.g., the sequence of the loss function values). During the training iterations of a machine learning algorithm, MQGrad continuously updates the MDP state according to the changes of the loss function. Based on the information, MDP learns to select the optimal actions (number of bits) to quantize the gradients. Experimental results based on a benchmark dataset showed that MQGrad can accelerate the learning of a large scale deep neural network while keeping its prediction accuracies.",0
"""Reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective at optimizing complex systems, but one challenge it faces is dealing with large datasets, particularly those stored on servers. One solution to this problem is gradient quantization, which reduces the precision required to represent gradients during training. In our work, we present MQGrad, a reinforcement learning framework that utilizes gradient quantization in parameter server environments. Our approach involves using a neural network to learn the optimal amount of precision required for each layer in the model, allowing us to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results show that MQGrad outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speedup and test loss, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.""",1
"Recent years have witnessed significant progresses in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Empowered with large scale neural networks, carefully designed architectures, novel training algorithms and massively parallel computing devices, researchers are able to attack many challenging RL problems. However, in machine learning, more training power comes with a potential risk of more overfitting. As deep RL techniques are being applied to critical problems such as healthcare and finance, it is important to understand the generalization behaviors of the trained agents. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of standard RL agents and find that they could overfit in various ways. Moreover, overfitting could happen ""robustly"": commonly used techniques in RL that add stochasticity do not necessarily prevent or detect overfitting. In particular, the same agents and learning algorithms could have drastically different test performance, even when all of them achieve optimal rewards during training. The observations call for more principled and careful evaluation protocols in RL. We conclude with a general discussion on overfitting in RL and a study of the generalization behaviors from the perspective of inductive bias.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex decision making problems ranging from game playing to robotics to finance. Despite their successes, DRL algorithms can suffer from overfitting which results in poor generalization performance. In this study, we investigate sources of overfitting in deep Q-networks (Q-Learning with neural networks), one of the most popular DRL algorithms used today. We identify several factors that contribute to overfitting including: i) random initialization of parameters; ii) limited capacity of neural network architectures; iii) small datasets relative to large model capacities; iv) high noise-to-signal ratio in the dataset due to the sparsity of rewards and stochasticity of transition dynamics. To mitigate overfitting, we propose various techniques such as regularization methods, architecture modifications, transfer learning, prioritized experience replay, ensemble learning and active exploration strategies. Our empirical evaluations across multiple benchmark tasks show the effectiveness of these approaches. By shedding light on the problem of overfitting in DRL, our work contributes to a better understanding of how to train reliable models under different conditions.",1
"Image segmentation needs both local boundary position information and global object context information. The performance of the recent state-of-the-art method, fully convolutional networks, reaches a bottleneck due to the neural network limit after balancing between the two types of information simultaneously in an end-to-end training style. To overcome this problem, we divide the semantic image segmentation into temporal subtasks. First, we find a possible pixel position of some object boundary; then trace the boundary at steps within a limited length until the whole object is outlined. We present the first deep reinforcement learning approach to semantic image segmentation, called DeepOutline, which outperforms other algorithms in Coco detection leaderboard in the middle and large size person category in Coco val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, it provides an insight into a divide and conquer way by reinforcement learning on computer vision problems.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents work that has been done on developing an agent capable of learning how to segment objects from images using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We have trained a DNN to predict an object outline based on the pixel values provided. Our system uses a policy gradient method called proximal policy optimization (PPO) which iteratively trains our model by maximizing a cumulative reward signal while minimizing the distance between predictions and ground truth labels. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve competitive performance compared to traditional methods such as FCN and CRF. Additionally, we have shown that our method is able to generalize across datasets and outperform previous works on certain benchmarks like PASCAL VOC dataset. These promising results demonstrate the potential applicability of our approach to real world image processing tasks where accurate object detection is important. Keywords: deep reinforcement learning, policy gradient, object segmentation, PASCAL VOC dataset.",1
"In real world systems, the predictions of deployed Machine Learned models affect the training data available to build subsequent models. This introduces a bias in the training data that needs to be addressed. Existing solutions to this problem attempt to resolve the problem by either casting this in the reinforcement learning framework or by quantifying the bias and re-weighting the loss functions. In this work, we develop a novel Adversarial Neural Network (ANN) model, an alternative approach which creates a representation of the data that is invariant to the bias. We take the Paid Search auction as our working example and ad display position features as the confounding features for this setting. We show the success of this approach empirically on both synthetic data as well as real world paid search auction data from a major search engine.",0

Our results show significant improvements over baseline models and prior art methods.""",1
"Very recently proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms have been proposed as first-order optimization methods for effective reinforcement learning. While PPO is inspired by the same learning theory that justifies trust region policy optimization (TRPO), PPO substantially simplifies algorithm design and improves data efficiency by performing multiple epochs of \emph{clipped policy optimization} from sampled data. Although clipping in PPO stands for an important new mechanism for efficient and reliable policy update, it may fail to adaptively improve learning performance in accordance with the importance of each sampled state. To address this issue, a new surrogate learning objective featuring an adaptive clipping mechanism is proposed in this paper, enabling us to develop a new algorithm, known as PPO-$\lambda$. PPO-$\lambda$ optimizes policies repeatedly based on a theoretical target for adaptive policy improvement. Meanwhile, destructively large policy update can be effectively prevented through both clipping and adaptive control of a hyperparameter $\lambda$ in PPO-$\lambda$, ensuring high learning reliability. PPO-$\lambda$ enjoys the same simple and efficient design as PPO. Empirically on several Atari game playing tasks and benchmark control tasks, PPO-$\lambda$ also achieved clearly better performance than PPO.",0
"Automatically tuning neural network hyperparameters such as learning rate can improve final results from reinforcement learning (RL) models like deep Q networks (DQNs), especially during training with large batches. We present two adaptations within proximal policy optimization (PPO) that enable efficient exploration into larger parameter spaces without requiring more computational resources: increasing the batch size or reducing learning rates. First, our ""Soft Clip"" adaptation limits how extreme gradients become by using gradient clipping only on some parameters randomly drawn per update rather than all at once. Second, we introduced three new ""Adaptive Clipping"" approaches including ""Average Normalized"", ""Boundary Bound"", and ""Ablation Search"". These methods dynamically choose which parameters require clipping based on their current magnitudes relative to other updated parameters or external thresholds. Our evaluations across five OpenAI Gym continuous control benchmark tasks show performance gains with each improvement.",1
"Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are an important concept in random matrix theory and combinatorics. They have also recently attracted interest in the study of numerical methods for machine learning, as they offer an elegant ""missing link"" between independent Monte Carlo sampling and deterministic evaluation on regular grids, applicable to a general set of spaces. This is helpful whenever an algorithm explores to reduce uncertainty, such as in active learning, Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, and marginalization in graphical models. To draw samples from a DPP in practice, existing literature focuses on approximate schemes of low cost, or comparably inefficient exact algorithms like rejection sampling. We point out that, for many settings of relevance to machine learning, it is also possible to draw exact samples from DPPs on continuous domains. We start from an intuitive example on the real line, which is then generalized to multivariate real vector spaces. We also compare to previously studied approximations, showing that exact sampling, despite higher cost, can be preferable where precision is needed.",0

"Learning-based color enhancement approaches typically learn to map from input images to retouched images. Most of existing methods require expensive pairs of input-retouched images or produce results in a non-interpretable way. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method for color enhancement to explicitly model the step-wise nature of human retouching process. We cast a color enhancement process as a Markov Decision Process where actions are defined as global color adjustment operations. Then we train our agent to learn the optimal global enhancement sequence of the actions. In addition, we present a 'distort-and-recover' training scheme which only requires high-quality reference images for training instead of input and retouched image pairs. Given high-quality reference images, we distort the images' color distribution and form distorted-reference image pairs for training. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method produces decent enhancement results and our DRL approach is more suitable for the 'distort-and-recover' training scheme than previous supervised approaches.

"The recent popularity of deep neural networks (DNNs) has generated a lot of research interest in performing DNN-related computation efficiently. However, the primary focus is usually very narrow and limited to (i) inference -- i.e. how to efficiently execute already trained models and (ii) image classification networks as the primary benchmark for evaluation.   Our primary goal in this work is to break this myopic view by (i) proposing a new benchmark for DNN training, called TBD (TBD is short for Training Benchmark for DNNs), that uses a representative set of DNN models that cover a wide range of machine learning applications: image classification, machine translation, speech recognition, object detection, adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and (ii) by performing an extensive performance analysis of training these different applications on three major deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, MXNet, CNTK) across different hardware configurations (single-GPU, multi-GPU, and multi-machine). TBD currently covers six major application domains and eight different state-of-the-art models.

"We propose expected policy gradients (EPG), which unify stochastic policy gradients (SPG) and deterministic policy gradients (DPG) for reinforcement learning. Inspired by expected sarsa, EPG integrates across the action when estimating the gradient, instead of relying only on the action in the sampled trajectory. We establish a new general policy gradient theorem, of which the stochastic and deterministic policy gradient theorems are special cases. We also prove that EPG reduces the variance of the gradient estimates without requiring deterministic policies and, for the Gaussian case, with no computational overhead. Finally, we show that it is optimal in a certain sense to explore with a Gaussian policy such that the covariance is proportional to the exponential of the scaled Hessian of the critic with respect to the actions. We present empirical results confirming that this new form of exploration substantially outperforms DPG with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck heuristic in four challenging MuJoCo domains.",0

"Human free-hand sketches have been studied in various contexts including sketch recognition, synthesis and fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR). A fundamental challenge for sketch analysis is to deal with drastically different human drawing styles, particularly in terms of abstraction level.

Concretely, we train a model for abstract sketch generation through reinforcement learning of a stroke removal policy that learns to predict which strokes can be safely removed without affecting recognizability. We show that our abstraction model can be used for various sketch analysis tasks including: (1) modeling stroke saliency and understanding the decision of sketch recognition models, (2) synthesizing sketches of variable abstraction for a given category, or reference object instance in a photo, and (3) training a FG-SBIR model with photos only, bypassing the expensive photo-sketch pair collection step.",0

We propose $E$-values, a generalization of counters that can be used to evaluate the propagating exploratory value over state-action trajectories. We compare our approach to commonly used RL techniques, and show that using $E$-values improves learning and performance over traditional counters.

We formulate a step-wise reward function proportional to how well the image is restored at each step to learn the action policy. We also devise a joint learning scheme to train the agent and tools for better performance in handling uncertainty. In comparison to conventional human-designed networks, RL-Restore is capable of restoring images corrupted with complex and unknown distortions in a more parameter-efficient manner using the dynamically formed toolchain.",0

"Teaching an agent to navigate in an unseen 3D environment is a challenging task, even in the event of simulated environments. To generalize to unseen environments, an agent needs to be robust to low-level variations (e.g. color, texture, object changes), and also high-level variations (e.g. layout changes of the environment). To improve overall generalization, all types of variations in the environment have to be taken under consideration via different level of data augmentation steps. To this end, we propose House3D, a rich, extensible and efficient environment that contains 45,622 human-designed 3D scenes of visually realistic houses, ranging from single-room studios to multi-storied houses, equipped with a diverse set of fully labeled 3D objects, textures and scene layouts, based on the SUNCG dataset (Song et.al.). The diversity in House3D opens the door towards scene-level augmentation, while the label-rich nature of House3D enables us to inject pixel- & task-level augmentations such as domain randomization (Toubin et. al.) and multi-task training. Using a subset of houses in House3D, we show that reinforcement learning agents trained with an enhancement of different levels of augmentations perform much better in unseen environments than our baselines with raw RGB input by over 8% in terms of navigation success rate. House3D is publicly available at http://github.com/facebookresearch/House3D.",0

"Hierarchical Modular Reinforcement Learning (HMRL), consists of 2 layered learning where Profit Sharing works to plan a prey position in the higher layer and Q-learning method trains the state-actions to the target in the lower layer. In this paper, we expanded HMRL to multi-target problem to take the distance between targets to the consideration. The function, called `AT field', can estimate the interests for an agent according to the distance between 2 agents and the advantage/disadvantage of the other agent. Moreover, the knowledge related to state-action rules is extracted by C4.5. The action under the situation is decided by using the acquired knowledge. To verify the effectiveness of proposed method, some experimental results are reported.",0
"A hierarchical modular reinforcement learning method can improve knowledge acquisition by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, simpler subtasks that are easier to learn and solve. This approach allows agents to efficiently explore different solutions and find optimal policies faster than traditional methods. By using state-action rules to represent states and actions as hierarchies, agents can organize their learned experiences and facilitate transfer learning between similar problems. To further enhance the effectiveness of these methods, we present a new algorithm based on multi-objective optimization techniques. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing approaches, achieving high accuracy and stability in solving difficult real-world multi-target tasks. Overall, our work provides valuable insights and practical tools for improving hierarchical modular RL algorithms and applying them in a variety of domains.",1
"Dialogue assistants are rapidly becoming an indispensable daily aid. To avoid the significant effort needed to hand-craft the required dialogue flow, the Dialogue Management (DM) module can be cast as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and trained through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Several RL models have been investigated over recent years. However, the lack of a common benchmarking framework makes it difficult to perform a fair comparison between different models and their capability to generalise to different environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of challenging simulated environments for dialogue model development and evaluation. To provide some baselines, we investigate a number of representative parametric algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning algorithms - DQN, A2C and Natural Actor-Critic and compare them to a non-parametric model, GP-SARSA. Both the environments and policy models are implemented using the publicly available PyDial toolkit and released on-line, in order to establish a testbed framework for further experiments and to facilitate experimental reproducibility.",0
"One significant challenge in task oriented dialogue management research is evaluating the performance of different algorithms and techniques, as there is no widely accepted benchmark dataset or evaluation protocol. In order to address this gap, we propose a new benchmarking environment that includes both simulation and real world data collection and testing, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning based approaches in a comprehensive manner. By providing datasets and tools that facilitate comparison across multiple domains and tasks, we aim to enable further development and progress in the field of task oriented dialogue management. Additionally, our work contributes towards advancing the state-of-the-art in conversational AI by promoting transparency, reproducibility, and open accessibility. Ultimately, our goal is to foster innovation and accelerate scientific discovery through collaboration within the academic community and beyond.",1
"A robot that can carry out a natural-language instruction has been a dream since before the Jetsons cartoon series imagined a life of leisure mediated by a fleet of attentive robot helpers. It is a dream that remains stubbornly distant. However, recent advances in vision and language methods have made incredible progress in closely related areas. This is significant because a robot interpreting a natural-language navigation instruction on the basis of what it sees is carrying out a vision and language process that is similar to Visual Question Answering. Both tasks can be interpreted as visually grounded sequence-to-sequence translation problems, and many of the same methods are applicable. To enable and encourage the application of vision and language methods to the problem of interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions, we present the Matterport3D Simulator -- a large-scale reinforcement learning environment based on real imagery. Using this simulator, which can in future support a range of embodied vision and language tasks, we provide the first benchmark dataset for visually-grounded natural language navigation in real buildings -- the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to vision-based language understanding, which enables robots to interpret visual scenes and follow complex spoken commands in natural human environments. We propose a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), allowing the robot to effectively integrate both short-term and long-term spatial reasoning. Our method takes raw visual input from onboard cameras and processes it through a sequence of deep learning models, each responsible for encoding different levels of abstraction, such as object detection, scene recognition, and semantic segmentation.  At the core of our system lies a novel instruction parser module that analyzes incoming textual guidance using a combination of rule-based heuristics and machine learning techniques. We cast the problem of navigating a robot by natural language as a hierarchical decision making process, where lower level decisions correspond to individual actions such as turning left or moving forward, while high-level plans capture more strategic goals like reaching specific locations within a building or finding objects based on their appearance. In order to implement these policies in reality, we have developed a modular behavior library containing customizable motion primitives capable of executing complex maneuvers in real time, given only raw image data and high-level action recommendations from our planning algorithm.  To validate our design choices and demonstrate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments involving both simulated robots and physical quadcopters equipped with off-the-shelf cameras flying through obstacle courses or following instructions provided by human operators. Results show that our integrated framework outperforms simpler baselines relying exclusively on either classic computer vision pipelines or state-of-the-art RL algorithms without human feedback, achieving substantial improvements in terms of success rate, speed, and robustness against noise or partial failures. With its strong focus on usability and versatility, our research opens up exciting opportunities for further development of intelligent systems that can seamlessly interact with humans in everyday contexts through a common medium of human languages and shared perceptu",1
"In 2015, Google's DeepMind announced an advancement in creating an autonomous agent based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that could beat a professional player in a series of 49 Atari games. However, the current manifestation of DRL is still immature, and has significant drawbacks. One of DRL's imperfections is its lack of ""exploration"" during the training process, especially when working with high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy approach that mimics behaviors of human when interacting with environment, and create a ""thinking"" agent that allows for more efficient exploration in the DRL training process. The simulation results based on the Breakout game show that our scheme achieves a higher probability of obtaining a maximum score than does the baseline DRL algorithm, i.e., the asynchronous advantage actor-critic method. The proposed scheme therefore can be applied effectively to solving a complicated task in a real-world application.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful technique for training agents to perform complex tasks in uncertain environments. However, many DRL algorithms struggle to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this challenge, we propose a human mixed strategy approach to DRL that incorporates domain knowledge and expert feedback into the decision-making process. Our framework allows for efficient use of computational resources while providing more control over agent behavior compared to existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark problems such as CartPole, Acrobot, MountainCar, and LunarLander. Results show that our approach leads to better overall performance than state-of-the-art DRL algorithms across different domains.",1
"A key challenge in complex visuomotor control is learning abstract representations that are effective for specifying goals, planning, and generalization. To this end, we introduce universal planning networks (UPN). UPNs embed differentiable planning within a goal-directed policy. This planning computation unrolls a forward model in a latent space and infers an optimal action plan through gradient descent trajectory optimization. The plan-by-gradient-descent process and its underlying representations are learned end-to-end to directly optimize a supervised imitation learning objective. We find that the representations learned are not only effective for goal-directed visual imitation via gradient-based trajectory optimization, but can also provide a metric for specifying goals using images. The learned representations can be leveraged to specify distance-based rewards to reach new target states for model-free reinforcement learning, resulting in substantially more effective learning when solving new tasks described via image-based goals. We were able to achieve successful transfer of visuomotor planning strategies across robots with significantly different morphologies and actuation capabilities.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning methods have shown great successes in a variety of artificial intelligence tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and control problems. However, few researchers have attempted to develop end-to-end deep learning approaches that can solve complex planning problems like those posed by classical planners. Here we present Universal Planning Network (UPN), which learns from human demonstrations to generate plans and behaviors for goal-directed agents operating in partially observable environments. Our approach uses a deep neural network architecture based on reinforcement learning principles to learn the mapping from observations to actions directly from raw state data. We evaluate UPN against several standard benchmark domains and show competitive performance compared to specialized planners and other learning baselines. Our results suggest that learning planners capable of solving real world problems may be feasible and could open up new perspectives for designing autonomous intelligent systems. Keywords: Planning; Deep Learning; Reinforcement Learning; Autonomous Agents.",1
"To ensure stability of learning, state-of-the-art generalized policy iteration algorithms augment the policy improvement step with a trust region constraint bounding the information loss. The size of the trust region is commonly determined by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which not only captures the notion of distance well but also yields closed-form solutions. In this paper, we consider a more general class of f-divergences and derive the corresponding policy update rules. The generic solution is expressed through the derivative of the convex conjugate function to f and includes the KL solution as a special case. Within the class of f-divergences, we further focus on a one-parameter family of $\alpha$-divergences to study effects of the choice of divergence on policy improvement. Previously known as well as new policy updates emerge for different values of $\alpha$. We show that every type of policy update comes with a compatible policy evaluation resulting from the chosen f-divergence. Interestingly, the mean-squared Bellman error minimization is closely related to policy evaluation with the Pearson $\chi^2$-divergence penalty, while the KL divergence results in the soft-max policy update and a log-sum-exp critic. We carry out asymptotic analysis of the solutions for different values of $\alpha$ and demonstrate the effects of using different divergence functions on a multi-armed bandit problem and on common standard reinforcement learning problems.",0
"In many reinforcement learning problems, we want our agent’s actions to satisfy some constraints. For example, if the agent is driving a car, we may wish to ensure that it stays within its lane; if it is controlling a robot arm, we might require that it move slowly to avoid breaking things. We can think of these constraints as placing restrictions on which probability distributions over actions are valid choices for the agent. One popular approach to incorporating such constraints into the training process is CPO (Convex Proper Orthant), a model-free algorithm that finds a locally optimal solution by minimizing a divergence measure subject to simple constraints expressed using polyhedra. While effective at finding solutions satisfying convex sets of linear inequality constraints, CPO struggles with nonconvex constraint sets. Nonetheless, we observe experimentally that a variant of CPO called PETS outperforms other methods when faced with difficult environments containing hard nonconvex constraints. Motivated to understand why PETS works well despite its reliance on local optimization and restrictive assumptions about constraint types, we investigate alternative algorithms that directly optimize policies while explicitly addressing challenges posed by more complex constraints. Our method is based on a general framework for solving constrained Markov decision processes via gradient-based iterative scaling. This involves alternately projecting gradients onto constraints and applying a line search along each descent direction, yielding an improvement step that satisfies both value-based Bellman equations and a relaxation of the original constraint set. Unlike previous work on projection methods for policy improvement with constraints, we derive a novel adaptive choice rule determining step sizes that maintain convergence guarantees. Empirically, we demonstrate substantial improvements ove",1
"All reinforcement learning algorithms must handle the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Many state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods use noise in the action selection, such as Gaussian noise in policy gradient methods or $\epsilon$-greedy in Q-learning. While these methods are appealing due to their simplicity, they do not explore the state space in a methodical manner. We present an approach that uses a model to derive reward bonuses as a means of intrinsic motivation to improve model-free reinforcement learning. A key insight of our approach is that this dynamics model can be learned in the latent feature space of a value function, representing the dynamics of the agent and the environment. This method is both theoretically grounded and computationally advantageous, permitting the efficient use of Bayesian information-theoretic methods in high-dimensional state spaces. We evaluate our method on several continuous control tasks, focusing on improving exploration.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for modeling latent dynamics in sequential decision making problems where the agent must actively search for relevant features that maximize expected cumulative rewards over time. Our method uses a latent space representation to infer hidden states corresponding to underlying physical processes such as movement patterns or object properties. We show how these latent representations can be used to optimize exploration policies using techniques from Bayesian Optimization. Through extensive simulation experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods on both deterministic and stochastic domains. Finally, we provide empirical evidence for the validity of our approach through real world applications including active perception tasks such as environmental monitoring and surveillance systems.",1
"Advances in deep generative networks have led to impressive results in recent years. Nevertheless, such models can often waste their capacity on the minutiae of datasets, presumably due to weak inductive biases in their decoders. This is where graphics engines may come in handy since they abstract away low-level details and represent images as high-level programs. Current methods that combine deep learning and renderers are limited by hand-crafted likelihood or distance functions, a need for large amounts of supervision, or difficulties in scaling their inference algorithms to richer datasets. To mitigate these issues, we present SPIRAL, an adversarially trained agent that generates a program which is executed by a graphics engine to interpret and sample images. The goal of this agent is to fool a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and rendered data, trained with a distributed reinforcement learning setup without any supervision. A surprising finding is that using the discriminator's output as a reward signal is the key to allow the agent to make meaningful progress at matching the desired output rendering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an end-to-end, unsupervised and adversarial inverse graphics agent on challenging real world (MNIST, Omniglot, CelebA) and synthetic 3D datasets.",0
"In recent years, generative models have achieved significant success in generating images based on textual descriptions. Despite their impressive performance, these methods often require large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them difficult to deploy in practice. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called reinforced adversarial learning (RAL) that efficiently synthesizes programs for image generation.  Our approach uses a program generator that produces simple code snippets which, when executed, produce diverse output images relevant to a given prompt. We train our model through a reward mechanism inspired by human feedback to optimize its behavior towards efficient code search and valid output images. By leveraging recent advances in RL algorithms for discrete actions spaces, we reduce the reliance on strong supervision signals such as dense pixelwise rewards commonly used in GANs. This enables us to scale up the size of our agent without sacrificing stability during training.  Empirical evaluation shows that RAL significantly outperforms prior work both qualitatively and quantitatively on several benchmark datasets, including CelebAHQ, ImageNet, and COCO, even though our generator is trained exclusively on unlabeled raw pixels from those sets. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can generate high quality and diverse results at reduced time complexity compared to state-of-the art alternatives, providing evidence that our framework is suitable for real world deployment scenarios where fast inference times are essential. Finally, subjective user studies further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method over competitive baselines. \end{abstract}",1
"In this paper, we present an online reinforcement learning algorithm, called Renewal Monte Carlo (RMC), for infinite horizon Markov decision processes with a designated start state. RMC is a Monte Carlo algorithm and retains the advantages of Monte Carlo methods including low bias, simplicity, and ease of implementation while, at the same time, circumvents their key drawbacks of high variance and delayed (end of episode) updates. The key ideas behind RMC are as follows. First, under any reasonable policy, the reward process is ergodic. So, by renewal theory, the performance of a policy is equal to the ratio of expected discounted reward to the expected discounted time over a regenerative cycle. Second, by carefully examining the expression for performance gradient, we propose a stochastic approximation algorithm that only requires estimates of the expected discounted reward and discounted time over a regenerative cycle and their gradients. We propose two unbiased estimators for evaluating performance gradients---a likelihood ratio based estimator and a simultaneous perturbation based estimator---and show that for both estimators, RMC converges to a locally optimal policy. We generalize the RMC algorithm to post-decision state models and also present a variant that converges faster to an approximately optimal policy. We conclude by presenting numerical experiments on a randomly generated MDP, event-triggered communication, and inventory management.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using renewal theory as a framework for studying decision making under uncertainty. While traditional methods have focused on Markov decision processes (MDPs), Renewal Monte Carlo (RMC) provides a new perspective that leverages renewals to improve performance and efficiency. This approach can be used in conjunction with reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing agents to learn optimal policies faster than those relying exclusively on MDP techniques. RMC offers significant benefits over standard approaches by modeling stochasticity through renewals, which enables better estimates of value functions and policy updates. By applying RMC in combination with modern reinforcement learning techniques, this work demonstrates improved results on challenging problems such as gridworld navigation tasks. Overall, our findings showcase the potential of RMC as a powerful tool for addressing decision making problems with uncertain elements. Further research into the use of renewal theory within machine learning may lead to exciting breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.",1
"Stochastic neural net weights are used in a variety of contexts, including regularization, Bayesian neural nets, exploration in reinforcement learning, and evolution strategies. Unfortunately, due to the large number of weights, all the examples in a mini-batch typically share the same weight perturbation, thereby limiting the variance reduction effect of large mini-batches. We introduce flipout, an efficient method for decorrelating the gradients within a mini-batch by implicitly sampling pseudo-independent weight perturbations for each example. Empirically, flipout achieves the ideal linear variance reduction for fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and RNNs. We find significant speedups in training neural networks with multiplicative Gaussian perturbations. We show that flipout is effective at regularizing LSTMs, and outperforms previous methods. Flipout also enables us to vectorize evolution strategies: in our experiments, a single GPU with flipout can handle the same throughput as at least 40 CPU cores using existing methods, equivalent to a factor-of-4 cost reduction on Amazon Web Services.",0
"""Efficient Pseudo-Independent Weight Perturbations on Mini-Batches"" presents a new approach to improving pseudo-independent weight perturbation techniques used in machine learning models.

By leveraging existing hardware capabilities, our technique outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency and model accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches, making this an ideal solution for high performance deep learning tasks where computational resources are limited. In summary, we present a novel, efficient, and effective method for generating robust weight perturbations that improve both speed and accuracy in machine learning models.",1
"The problem of object localization and recognition on autonomous mobile robots is still an active topic. In this context, we tackle the problem of learning a model of visual saliency directly on a robot. This model, learned and improved on-the-fly during the robot's exploration provides an efficient tool for localizing relevant objects within their environment. The proposed approach includes two intertwined components. On the one hand, we describe a method for learning and incrementally updating a model of visual saliency from a depth-based object detector. This model of saliency can also be exploited to produce bounding box proposals around objects of interest. On the other hand, we investigate an autonomous exploration technique to efficiently learn such a saliency model. The proposed exploration, called Reinforcement Learning-Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (RL-IAC) is able to drive the robot's exploration so that samples selected by the robot are likely to improve the current model of saliency. We then demonstrate that such a saliency model learned directly on a robot outperforms several state-of-the-art saliency techniques, and that RL-IAC can drastically decrease the required time for learning a reliable saliency model.",0
"Visual saliency, or the ability to identify visually distinctive objects from their surroundings, plays a crucial role in many real-world applications such as robotics, image classification, object recognition, and video surveillance.

In this paper, we present a new reinforcement learning algorithm (RL) combined with an incremental attention model (IAC), which enables our system to explore its environment to improve its performance on a given task over time. Our method builds upon state-of-the art techniques like policy gradients and actor-critic methods by using these algorithms within an IAC framework. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

"Learning probability distributions on the weights of neural networks (NNs) has recently proven beneficial in many applications. Bayesian methods, such as Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), offer an elegant framework to reason about NN model uncertainty. However, by assuming independent Gaussian priors for the individual NN weights (as often applied), SVGD does not impose prior knowledge that there is often structural information (dependence) among weights. We propose efficient posterior learning of structural weight uncertainty, within an SVGD framework, by employing matrix variate Gaussian priors on NN parameters. We further investigate the learned structural uncertainty in sequential decision-making problems, including contextual bandits and reinforcement learning. Experiments on several synthetic and real datasets indicate the superiority of our model, compared with state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a new method for modeling structural uncertainty in sequential decision making problems.

Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to methods that assume a fixed model structure, showing improved performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. Additionally, we show how our method can be combined with existing planning algorithms to produce more effective policies.

"This paper proposes that adapting existing RL methods to handle complex neuromuscular environments requires new approaches to address three key challenges: controlling exploration without causing damage; efficiently sampling physically realistic behaviors from high dimensional spaces; and transferring knowledge gained on simulated systems into the real world. To meet these needs we present three novel techniques and integrate them within the state-of-the-art MuJoCo Control Suite (MC2) framework. In experiments across six continuous control tasks—including Acrobot Walk, Hopper Hop, Ant Swimmer, Reacher Easy, HalfCheetah Medium, and Humanoid Stand Up—we show MC2 enables agents to learn better policies than previous model-free deep RL approaches while using fewer environment interactions or computation. By providing an open-source toolkit enabling users to easily switch among policy evaluation and execution backends, our work helps advance both research and application opportunities at the intersection of machine learning and robotics. --- ABSTRACT: This paper presents solutions to three key challenges faced by existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods when applied to complex neuromuscular environments, such as those encountered in robotic platforms like Acrobot Walk, Hopper Hop, Ant Swimmer, Reacher Easy, HalfCheetah Medium, and Humanoid Stand Up.

"Recent advances in policy gradient methods and deep learning have demonstrated their applicability for complex reinforcement learning problems. However, the variance of the performance gradient estimates obtained from the simulation is often excessive, leading to poor sample efficiency. In this paper, we apply the stochastic variance reduced gradient descent (SVRG) to model-free policy gradient to significantly improve the sample-efficiency. The SVRG estimation is incorporated into a trust-region Newton conjugate gradient framework for the policy optimization. On several Mujoco tasks, our method achieves significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art model-free policy gradient methods in robotic continuous control such as trust region policy optimization (TRPO)",0

"Existing inefficient traffic light control causes numerous problems, such as long delay and waste of energy. To improve efficiency, taking real-time traffic information as an input and dynamically adjusting the traffic light duration accordingly is a must. In terms of how to dynamically adjust traffic signals' duration, existing works either split the traffic signal into equal duration or extract limited traffic information from the real data. In this paper, we study how to decide the traffic signals' duration based on the collected data from different sensors and vehicular networks. We propose a deep reinforcement learning model to control the traffic light. In the model, we quantify the complex traffic scenario as states by collecting data and dividing the whole intersection into small grids. The timing changes of a traffic light are the actions, which are modeled as a high-dimension Markov decision process. The reward is the cumulative waiting time difference between two cycles. To solve the model, a convolutional neural network is employed to map the states to rewards. The proposed model is composed of several components to improve the performance, such as dueling network, target network, double Q-learning network, and prioritized experience replay. We evaluate our model via simulation in the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) in a vehicular network, and the simulation results show the efficiency of our model in controlling traffic lights.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology to improve traffic light control systems in urban areas. One approach that shows great promise is deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL algorithms can learn optimal control policies directly from raw sensory input without the need for human supervision, making them well suited for complex real-world applications such as traffic management. This paper presents a comprehensive study on using DRL for traffic light control in vehicular networks. We consider both single intersection and multiple intersections scenarios, and compare several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms including Q-Learning, Sarsa, Policy Gradient, Proximal Policy Optimization, and Soft Actor Critic. Our results show that all the evaluated DRL algorithms significantly outperform traditional rule-based schemes, achieving up to 47% reduction in average waiting time and 8% increase in total throughput. Furthermore, we conduct detailed analysis on how different design choices affect the performance of each algorithm.

"Video captioning is the task of automatically generating a textual description of the actions in a video. Although previous work (e.g. sequence-to-sequence model) has shown promising results in abstracting a coarse description of a short video, it is still very challenging to caption a video containing multiple fine-grained actions with a detailed description. This paper aims to address the challenge by proposing a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for video captioning, where a high-level Manager module learns to design sub-goals and a low-level Worker module recognizes the primitive actions to fulfill the sub-goal. With this compositional framework to reinforce video captioning at different levels, our approach significantly outperforms all the baseline methods on a newly introduced large-scale dataset for fine-grained video captioning. Furthermore, our non-ensemble model has already achieved the state-of-the-art results on the widely-used MSR-VTT dataset.",0
"In order to make videos accessible to everyone and enable new search functionalities like video browsing through text queries, automatic video captioning has become more relevant than ever before. State-of-the-art systems rely on complex recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that need to process large amounts of data to generate high quality results. However, these models have two main drawbacks: they require huge computational resources and time which makes them hard to deploy in real-time applications, and they suffer from poor scalability to unseen domains due to overfitting problems related to their strong reliance on large datasets during training. To address these issues, we propose an innovative hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for video captioning based on deep neural network architectures. Our system learns to predict meaningful phrases, called macros, which can then be combined into full captions using appropriate heuristics. This allows our model to significantly reduce computation requirements while still achieving competitive performance compared to RNN-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing it against state-of-the-art approaches across several benchmark datasets and showcasing its capability to handle diverse domains including unseen scenarios without any additional fine- tuning. We hope that our research paves the way towards efficient and adaptive solutions for video description generation, enabling wide spread adoption of this important technology beyond academic research settings.",1
"Animals execute goal-directed behaviours despite the limited range and scope of their sensors. To cope, they explore environments and store memories maintaining estimates of important information that is not presently available. Recently, progress has been made with artificial intelligence (AI) agents that learn to perform tasks from sensory input, even at a human level, by merging reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with deep neural networks, and the excitement surrounding these results has led to the pursuit of related ideas as explanations of non-human animal learning. However, we demonstrate that contemporary RL algorithms struggle to solve simple tasks when enough information is concealed from the sensors of the agent, a property called ""partial observability"". An obvious requirement for handling partially observed tasks is access to extensive memory, but we show memory is not enough; it is critical that the right information be stored in the right format. We develop a model, the Memory, RL, and Inference Network (MERLIN), in which memory formation is guided by a process of predictive modeling. MERLIN facilitates the solution of tasks in 3D virtual reality environments for which partial observability is severe and memories must be maintained over long durations. Our model demonstrates a single learning agent architecture that can solve canonical behavioural tasks in psychology and neurobiology without strong simplifying assumptions about the dimensionality of sensory input or the duration of experiences.",0
"This study examines unsupervised predictive memory (PM) in goal-directed agents, exploring how this cognitive function can enable adaptive behavior through forward simulation of future events.

Furthermore, our results suggest that the integration of PM leads to greater efficiency and generalization capabilities within RL agents. These findings have important implications for developing intelligent systems capable of complex problem solving and effective decision making under uncertainty. Overall, our work highlights the potential value of integrating PM mechanisms into artificial intelligence architectures to promote more advanced cognition and action selection abilities in goal-driven environments.",1
"We introduce a generic framework that reduces the computational cost of object detection while retaining accuracy for scenarios where objects with varied sizes appear in high resolution images. Detection progresses in a coarse-to-fine manner, first on a down-sampled version of the image and then on a sequence of higher resolution regions identified as likely to improve the detection accuracy. Built upon reinforcement learning, our approach consists of a model (R-net) that uses coarse detection results to predict the potential accuracy gain for analyzing a region at a higher resolution and another model (Q-net) that sequentially selects regions to zoom in. Experiments on the Caltech Pedestrians dataset show that our approach reduces the number of processed pixels by over 50% without a drop in detection accuracy. The merits of our approach become more significant on a high resolution test set collected from YFCC100M dataset, where our approach maintains high detection performance while reducing the number of processed pixels by about 70% and the detection time by over 50%.",0
"In this work, we propose a novel approach for object detection in large images using dynamic zooming. We develop a network architecture that dynamically selects regions of interest within the image based on their relevance to object detection, allowing us to focus computational resources where they are most needed. Our method uses two stages: first, a deep neural network predicts pixelwise probabilities of containing objects across the entire input image. These predictions are then used by a second stage to select subregions of varying sizes, which are passed through a lightweight detector that outputs bounding boxes for detected objects.  We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets for object detection, including PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, achieving state-of-the-art performance at reduced computational cost compared to previous methods. We show that our approach can effectively detect objects in high resolution images while reducing computation time and improving accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our dynamic zooming strategy for handling different scales and aspect ratios of objects present in real world scenes. Finally, we provide qualitative evaluations showing improved object localization over traditional object detection techniques. Our results suggest that dynamic zoom-in networks have great potential for applications such as autonomous driving and security surveillance, where real-time object detection is critical.",1
"Unfair pricing policies have been shown to be one of the most negative perceptions customers can have concerning pricing, and may result in long-term losses for a company. Despite the fact that dynamic pricing models help companies maximize revenue, fairness and equality should be taken into account in order to avoid unfair price differences between groups of customers. This paper shows how to solve dynamic pricing by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques so that prices are maximized while keeping a balance between revenue and fairness. We demonstrate that RL provides two main features to support fairness in dynamic pricing: on the one hand, RL is able to learn from recent experience, adapting the pricing policy to complex market environments; on the other hand, it provides a trade-off between short and long-term objectives, hence integrating fairness into the model's core. Considering these two features, we propose the application of RL for revenue optimization, with the additional integration of fairness as part of the learning procedure by using Jain's index as a metric. Results in a simulated environment show a significant improvement in fairness while at the same time maintaining optimisation of revenue.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for fair dynamic pricing that takes into account both consumer behavior and market dynamics. We model the problem as a multi-agent system where consumers make decisions based on their own utility functions, while firms use dynamic pricing strategies to maximize revenue. Our approach incorporates social welfare considerations into firm objectives by introducing a novel utilitarian value function that balances profitability and fairness. Through simulation experiments, we show that our method achieves better overall economic performance than traditional static pricing methods and leads to more equitable outcomes across different subgroups of consumers. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm adapts effectively to changing market conditions over time, making it well suited for real-world applications. By providing insights into how artificial intelligence can support efficient and socially responsible decision-making, our work contributes to important debates in economics, business strategy, and public policy. Keywords: reinforcement learning, dynamic pricing, fairness, multi-agent systems, utilitarianism.",1
"Goals for reinforcement learning problems are typically defined through hand-specified rewards. To design such problems, developers of learning algorithms must inherently be aware of what the task goals are, yet we often require agents to discover them on their own without any supervision beyond these sparse rewards. While much of the power of reinforcement learning derives from the concept that agents can learn with little guidance, this requirement greatly burdens the training process. If we relax this one restriction and endow the agent with knowledge of the reward function, and in particular of the goal, we can leverage backwards induction to accelerate training. To achieve this, we propose training a model to learn to take imagined reversal steps from known goal states. Rather than training an agent exclusively to determine how to reach a goal while moving forwards in time, our approach travels backwards to jointly predict how we got there. We evaluate our work in Gridworld and Towers of Hanoi and empirically demonstrate that it yields better performance than standard DDQN.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL), which combines elements of both forward and backward passes from deep neural networks into one unified framework. The proposed method, called Forward-Backward RL, leverages both temporal directions of the data distribution to better learn meaningful representations and improve performance on challenging control tasks. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional algorithms across several benchmark domains, including Atari games and continuous control problems. Our results suggest that combining forward and backward processing can greatly enhance RL performance and open up opportunities for novel architectures and training schemes in deep learning.",1
"Manually labeling datasets with object masks is extremely time consuming. In this work, we follow the idea of Polygon-RNN to produce polygonal annotations of objects interactively using humans-in-the-loop. We introduce several important improvements to the model: 1) we design a new CNN encoder architecture, 2) show how to effectively train the model with Reinforcement Learning, and 3) significantly increase the output resolution using a Graph Neural Network, allowing the model to accurately annotate high-resolution objects in images. Extensive evaluation on the Cityscapes dataset shows that our model, which we refer to as Polygon-RNN++, significantly outperforms the original model in both automatic (10% absolute and 16% relative improvement in mean IoU) and interactive modes (requiring 50% fewer clicks by annotators). We further analyze the cross-domain scenario in which our model is trained on one dataset, and used out of the box on datasets from varying domains. The results show that Polygon-RNN++ exhibits powerful generalization capabilities, achieving significant improvements over existing pixel-wise methods. Using simple online fine-tuning we further achieve a high reduction in annotation time for new datasets, moving a step closer towards an interactive annotation tool to be used in practice.",0

Our approach leverages advances in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to create polygon annotations that closely match the underlying image data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several challenging benchmark datasets and compare favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide an interactive annotation interface that allows users to quickly refine and validate the generated annotations. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in automated semantic segmentation and has important applications across many domains including computer vision, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.",1
"Active Reinforcement Learning (ARL) is a twist on RL where the agent observes reward information only if it pays a cost. This subtle change makes exploration substantially more challenging. Powerful principles in RL like optimism, Thompson sampling, and random exploration do not help with ARL. We relate ARL in tabular environments to Bayes-Adaptive MDPs. We provide an ARL algorithm using Monte-Carlo Tree Search that is asymptotically Bayes optimal. Experimentally, this algorithm is near-optimal on small Bandit problems and MDPs. On larger MDPs it outperforms a Q-learner augmented with specialised heuristics for ARL. By analysing exploration behaviour in detail, we uncover obstacles to scaling up simulation-based algorithms for ARL.",0
"This paper presents an approach to active reinforcement learning that uses Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to guide the agent towards making better decisions. We propose using MCTS to evaluate and improve the policy exploration process by selecting actions to maximize expected cumulative reward over time. Our method is based on two key components: (i) using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate future rewards under different policies, and (ii) optimizing parameters via gradient ascent to find better policies faster. Through experiments on several benchmark problems, we demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Overall, our results suggest that combining MCTS with reinforcement learning can lead to more intelligent agents capable of solving complex realworld tasks.",1
"The performance of off-policy learning, including deep Q-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), critically depends on the choice of the exploration policy. Existing exploration methods are mostly based on adding noise to the on-going actor policy and can only explore \emph{local} regions close to what the actor policy dictates. In this work, we develop a simple meta-policy gradient algorithm that allows us to adaptively learn the exploration policy in DDPG. Our algorithm allows us to train flexible exploration behaviors that are independent of the actor policy, yielding a \emph{global exploration} that significantly speeds up the learning process. With an extensive study, we show that our method significantly improves the sample-efficiency of DDPG on a variety of reinforcement learning tasks.",0
"As machine learning models become increasingly complex, finding effective exploration strategies that balance exploitation and novelty-seeking has emerged as a crucial challenge. In recent years, meta-learning methods have been applied to improve model performance by training on multiple tasks. However, these approaches still face challenges in maintaining diversity during evaluation. To address these issues, we propose a new algorithm called ""Meta-policy gradient"" (MPG) that effectively balances between exploiting existing knowledge and exploring new territory. MPG is based on deep reinforcement learning from human preferences, allowing the agent to learn which actions lead to more diverse evaluations over time. This approach enables the agent to continuously update its policy in real-time, leading to improved performance compared to traditional static policies or even other state-of-the-art meta-learning techniques. Our extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG in achieving high accuracy while encouraging exploratory behavior. These results suggest that MPG may serve as a valuable tool for improving data efficiency in artificial intelligence applications.",1
"Inspired by the seminal work on Stein Variational Inference and Stein Variational Policy Gradient, we derived a method to generate samples from the posterior variational parameter distribution by \textit{explicitly} minimizing the KL divergence to match the target distribution in an amortize fashion.

We introduce a variational inference framework that allows us to efficiently approximate the policy distribution by making use of latent variables and a flexible prior over policies. Our method enables efficient exploration and exploitation of the policy space, resulting in better solutions than existing approaches. By enabling efficient computation of expectations related to the policy, our approach improves upon previous work that relied on Monte Carlo sampling techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on challenging control tasks, where we achieve state-of-the-art results. Overall, this paper represents a significant advancement in the field of reinforcement learning and has important implications for real-world applications.",1
"Here we propose using the successor representation (SR) to accelerate learning in a constructive knowledge system based on general value functions (GVFs). In real-world settings like robotics for unstructured and dynamic environments, it is infeasible to model all meaningful aspects of a system and its environment by hand due to both complexity and size. Instead, robots must be capable of learning and adapting to changes in their environment and task, incrementally constructing models from their own experience. GVFs, taken from the field of reinforcement learning (RL), are a way of modeling the world as predictive questions. One approach to such models proposes a massive network of interconnected and interdependent GVFs, which are incrementally added over time. It is reasonable to expect that new, incrementally added predictions can be learned more swiftly if the learning process leverages knowledge gained from past experience. The SR provides such a means of separating the dynamics of the world from the prediction targets and thus capturing regularities that can be reused across multiple GVFs. As a primary contribution of this work, we show that using SR-based predictions can improve sample efficiency and learning speed in a continual learning setting where new predictions are incrementally added and learned over time. We analyze our approach in a grid-world and then demonstrate its potential on data from a physical robot arm.",0
"This paper explores how the successor representation can accelerate learning in constructive predictive frameworks by reducing the computational cost of inference and model training. By using a successor representation, we show that it is possible to increase efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. We also demonstrate through experiments on real-world datasets that the use of a successor representation leads to faster convergence and better overall performance compared to traditional methods. Finally, we provide insights into why the successor representation works and how it can improve understanding of the decision making process in complex models. Overall, our work has important implications for both theory and practice, as it provides a new perspective on efficient machine learning algorithms that could potentially impact many applications areas including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.",1
"RANSAC is an important algorithm in robust optimization and a central building block for many computer vision applications. In recent years, traditionally hand-crafted pipelines have been replaced by deep learning pipelines, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. However, RANSAC has so far not been used as part of such deep learning pipelines, because its hypothesis selection procedure is non-differentiable. In this work, we present two different ways to overcome this limitation. The most promising approach is inspired by reinforcement learning, namely to replace the deterministic hypothesis selection by a probabilistic selection for which we can derive the expected loss w.r.t. to all learnable parameters. We call this approach DSAC, the differentiable counterpart of RANSAC. We apply DSAC to the problem of camera localization, where deep learning has so far failed to improve on traditional approaches. We demonstrate that by directly minimizing the expected loss of the output camera poses, robustly estimated by RANSAC, we achieve an increase in accuracy. In the future, any deep learning pipeline can use DSAC as a robust optimization component.",0

"Policy gradient methods have enjoyed great success in deep reinforcement learning but suffer from high variance of gradient estimates. The high variance problem is particularly exasperated in problems with long horizons or high-dimensional action spaces. To mitigate this issue, we derive a bias-free action-dependent baseline for variance reduction which fully exploits the structural form of the stochastic policy itself and does not make any additional assumptions about the MDP. We demonstrate and quantify the benefit of the action-dependent baseline through both theoretical analysis as well as numerical results, including an analysis of the suboptimality of the optimal state-dependent baseline. The result is a computationally efficient policy gradient algorithm, which scales to high-dimensional control problems, as demonstrated by a synthetic 2000-dimensional target matching task. Our experimental results indicate that action-dependent baselines allow for faster learning on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks and high-dimensional hand manipulation and synthetic tasks. Finally, we show that the general idea of including additional information in baselines for improved variance reduction can be extended to partially observed and multi-agent tasks.",0
"This paper presents a new method for reducing variance in policy gradient algorithms, specifically focusing on action-dependent factorized baselines. By incorporating recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning, we propose a novel approach that effectively mitigates the high variability observed in traditional policy gradients methods. Our proposed method combines both model-free and model-based techniques, resulting in increased stability and improved sample efficiency. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluation across several benchmark tasks that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art variance reduction methods by achieving higher returns while requiring fewer samples per iteration. Furthermore, our method can be applied to any actor-critic architecture, making it easily adoptable within existing frameworks. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward in addressing one of the key challenges facing policy gradient approaches today: reducing variance during training.",1
"We propose a self-supervised approach for learning representations and robotic behaviors entirely from unlabeled videos recorded from multiple viewpoints, and study how this representation can be used in two robotic imitation settings: imitating object interactions from videos of humans, and imitating human poses. Imitation of human behavior requires a viewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between end-effectors (hands or robot grippers) and the environment, object attributes, and body pose. We train our representations using a metric learning loss, where multiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the embedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often visually similar but functionally different. In other words, the model simultaneously learns to recognize what is common between different-looking images, and what is different between similar-looking images. This signal causes our model to discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint, but do change across time, while ignoring nuisance variables such as occlusions, motion blur, lighting and background. We demonstrate that this representation can be used by a robot to directly mimic human poses without an explicit correspondence, and that it can be used as a reward function within a reinforcement learning algorithm. While representations are learned from an unlabeled collection of task-related videos, robot behaviors such as pouring are learned by watching a single 3rd-person demonstration by a human. Reward functions obtained by following the human demonstrations under the learned representation enable efficient reinforcement learning that is practical for real-world robotic systems.

"Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to developing hard-to-engineer adaptive solutions for complex and diverse robotic tasks. However, learning with real-world robots is often unreliable and difficult, which resulted in their low adoption in reinforcement learning research. This difficulty is worsened by the lack of guidelines for setting up learning tasks with robots. In this work, we develop a learning task with a UR5 robotic arm to bring to light some key elements of a task setup and study their contributions to the challenges with robots. We find that learning performance can be highly sensitive to the setup, and thus oversights and omissions in setup details can make effective learning, reproducibility, and fair comparison hard. Our study suggests some mitigating steps to help future experimenters avoid difficulties and pitfalls. We show that highly reliable and repeatable experiments can be performed in our setup, indicating the possibility of reinforcement learning research extensively based on real-world robots.",0
"This paper describes how we set up a reinforcement learning (RL) task for a real-world robot. RL algorithms have proven to be effective at solving complex problems, but they can be difficult to apply to physical robots due to the challenges involved in setting up a suitable environment and collecting data efficiently. To address these issues, we propose a method that uses simulation as a tool for pretraining the agent before deploying it on the actual robot. By doing so, we are able to significantly speed up the training process while maintaining high performance. We demonstrate our approach using a six degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator arm, where the objective is to reach random targets while minimizing collision forces. Our results show that agents trained with our proposed method outperform existing methods in terms of both success rate and efficiency.",1
"A common belief in model-free reinforcement learning is that methods based on random search in the parameter space of policies exhibit significantly worse sample complexity than those that explore the space of actions. We dispel such beliefs by introducing a random search method for training static, linear policies for continuous control problems, matching state-of-the-art sample efficiency on the benchmark MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our method also finds a nearly optimal controller for a challenging instance of the Linear Quadratic Regulator, a classical problem in control theory, when the dynamics are not known. Computationally, our random search algorithm is at least 15 times more efficient than the fastest competing model-free methods on these benchmarks. We take advantage of this computational efficiency to evaluate the performance of our method over hundreds of random seeds and many different hyperparameter configurations for each benchmark task. Our simulations highlight a high variability in performance in these benchmark tasks, suggesting that commonly used estimations of sample efficiency do not adequately evaluate the performance of RL algorithms.",0
"In this article we show that simple random search can provide results comparable to traditional Q-learning methods on several benchmark problems.

"An online reinforcement learning algorithm is anytime if it does not need to know in advance the horizon T of the experiment. A well-known technique to obtain an anytime algorithm from any non-anytime algorithm is the ""Doubling Trick"". In the context of adversarial or stochastic multi-armed bandits, the performance of an algorithm is measured by its regret, and we study two families of sequences of growing horizons (geometric and exponential) to generalize previously known results that certain doubling tricks can be used to conserve certain regret bounds. In a broad setting, we prove that a geometric doubling trick can be used to conserve (minimax) bounds in $R\_T = O(\sqrt{T})$ but cannot conserve (distribution-dependent) bounds in $R\_T = O(\log T)$. We give insights as to why exponential doubling tricks may be better, as they conserve bounds in $R\_T = O(\log T)$, and are close to conserving bounds in $R\_T = O(\sqrt{T})$.",0

In particular, we consider how these techniques can be adapted and extended to enable more effective learning across complex search spaces. Our analysis shows that careful application of doubling tricks can greatly improve the efficiency of such algorithms by reducing the number of iterations required to find acceptable solutions. We provide examples to illustrate our approach and demonstrate the benefits on both synthetic datasets as well as real world applications. Finally, we discuss future directions for researchers interested in applying doubling trick methods in practice. What are your thoughts?",1
"Model-free deep reinforcement learning has been shown to exhibit good performance in domains ranging from video games to simulated robotic manipulation and locomotion. However, model-free methods are known to perform poorly when the interaction time with the environment is limited, as is the case for most real-world robotic tasks. In this paper, we study how maximum entropy policies trained using soft Q-learning can be applied to real-world robotic manipulation. The application of this method to real-world manipulation is facilitated by two important features of soft Q-learning. First, soft Q-learning can learn multimodal exploration strategies by learning policies represented by expressive energy-based models. Second, we show that policies learned with soft Q-learning can be composed to create new policies, and that the optimality of the resulting policy can be bounded in terms of the divergence between the composed policies. This compositionality provides an especially valuable tool for real-world manipulation, where constructing new policies by composing existing skills can provide a large gain in efficiency over training from scratch. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that soft Q-learning is substantially more sample efficient than prior model-free deep reinforcement learning methods, and that compositionality can be performed for both simulated and real-world tasks.",0

"In recent years, visual question answering (VQA) has become topical. The premise of VQA's significance as a benchmark in AI, is that both the image and textual question need to be well understood and mutually grounded in order to infer the correct answer. However, current VQA models perhaps `understand' less than initially hoped, and instead master the easier task of exploiting cues given away in the question and biases in the answer distribution. In this paper we propose the inverse problem of VQA (iVQA). The iVQA task is to generate a question that corresponds to a given image and answer pair. We propose a variational iVQA model that can generate diverse, grammatically correct and content correlated questions that match the given answer. Based on this model, we show that iVQA is an interesting benchmark for visuo-linguistic understanding, and a more challenging alternative to VQA because an iVQA model needs to understand the image better to be successful. As a second contribution, we show how to use iVQA in a novel reinforcement learning framework to diagnose any existing VQA model by way of exposing its belief set: the set of question-answer pairs that the VQA model would predict true for a given image. This provides a completely new window into what VQA models `believe' about images. We show that existing VQA models have more erroneous beliefs than previously thought, revealing their intrinsic weaknesses. Suggestions are then made on how to address these weaknesses going forward.",0
"Title: Inverse Visual Question Answering: Developing a New Benchmark and VQA Diagnostic Tool  Abstract: In recent years, visual question answering (VQA) has become a popular research area in computer vision, aimed at developing models that can accurately respond to natural language queries about images. However, creating high-quality VQA datasets remains a challenge, as manually generating questions and answers requires significant human effort and expertise. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called ""inverse VQA"" that involves automatically generating VQA pairs by manipulating real-world images and their corresponding questions and answers. Our method leverages existing image editing tools to modify objects within an image while preserving overall scene context. We then use GPT-based language models to generate alternative question/answer pairs based on these modified images.  We demonstrate that our inverse VQA approach can effectively create diverse, challenging, and informative VQA benchmarks with high variability across different metrics such as difficulty level, similarity, and topic. Furthermore, we introduce a diagnostic tool built upon our inverse pipeline, which can analyze VQA model failures and provide insights into how different components contribute to the correctness or incorrectness of each response. This tool enables users to gain deeper understanding into how individual aspects of a question or object recognition affect the final output of a VQA model.  Our work represents a step towards more effective and efficient VQA dataset generation, enabling future development of improved models and evaluation methods in this important field. With its potential applications in areas like assistive technologies, education, and entertainment, the advancements made possible through inverse VQA have promising implications for the broader artificial intelligence community.

"The existing image captioning approaches typically train a one-stage sentence decoder, which is difficult to generate rich fine-grained descriptions. On the other hand, multi-stage image caption model is hard to train due to the vanishing gradient problem. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine multi-stage prediction framework for image captioning, composed of multiple decoders each of which operates on the output of the previous stage, producing increasingly refined image descriptions. Our proposed learning approach addresses the difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervisions. Particularly, we optimize our model with a reinforcement learning approach which utilizes the output of each intermediate decoder's test-time inference algorithm as well as the output of its preceding decoder to normalize the rewards, which simultaneously solves the well-known exposure bias problem and the loss-evaluation mismatch problem. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach on MSCOCO and show that our approach can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.",0
"A new method for image captioning called ""Stack-captioning"" has been developed that leverages coarse-to-fine learning techniques to improve the quality and accuracy of generated descriptions. This approach involves first generating a rough caption for each image using deep neural networks and then refining these initial captions through several rounds of iterations. Each iteration uses a different model architecture, trained on high-quality human annotations, to progressively enhance the descriptive details and coherence of the final output. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art models across multiple evaluation metrics, including F1 scores, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and SPICE. These findings suggest that the proposed stack-captioning framework could have important applications in areas such as content generation, automated video summarization, and computer vision-based assistive technologies.",1
"Many practical environments contain catastrophic states that an optimal agent would visit infrequently or never. Even on toy problems, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents tend to periodically revisit these states upon forgetting their existence under a new policy. We introduce intrinsic fear (IF), a learned reward shaping that guards DRL agents against periodic catastrophes. IF agents possess a fear model trained to predict the probability of imminent catastrophe. This score is then used to penalize the Q-learning objective. Our theoretical analysis bounds the reduction in average return due to learning on the perturbed objective. We also prove robustness to classification errors. As a bonus, IF models tend to learn faster, owing to reward shaping. Experiments demonstrate that intrinsic-fear DQNs solve otherwise pathological environments and improve on several Atari games.",0
"Title: ""Overcoming the Challenges of Reinforcement Learning through Intrinsic Motivation""  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful tool for training agents to perform complex tasks in domains ranging from robotics to video games. However, RL algorithms face several challenges that can make training difficult and unreliable, including the well-known ""Sisyphean curse,"" where an agent may become stuck in an infinite loop of trial and error without making any meaningful progress towards its goal. This paper presents a novel approach to addressing these issues by incorporating intrinsic motivation into the RL algorithm.  We propose using fear as an intrinsic motivator for guiding the agent towards exploration and problem solving. By modeling fear as a negative reward signal, we can encourage the agent to take risks and explore new strategies while minimizing catastrophic failures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark problems, showing that our method consistently outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of speed, stability, and overall performance. Our results suggest that adding intrinsic motivation to reinforcement learning algorithms can significantly improve their ability to learn complex skills efficiently.  Our work contributes to the broader field of artificial intelligence by introducing a simple yet effective mechanism for improving the robustness and reliability of RL algorithms. With further development, we believe our approach could have important implications for fields such as autonomous vehicles, manufacturing automation, and game design. Overall, this research shows promise for advancing the state of the art in reinforcement learning and pushing the boundaries of what machines are capable of achieving.",1
"In this work, we provide theoretical guarantees for reward decomposition in deterministic MDPs. Reward decomposition is a special case of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, that allows one to learn many policies in parallel and combine them into a composite solution. Our approach builds on mapping this problem into a Reward Discounted Traveling Salesman Problem, and then deriving approximate solutions for it. In particular, we focus on approximate solutions that are local, i.e., solutions that only observe information about the current state. Local policies are easy to implement and do not require substantial computational resources as they do not perform planning. While local deterministic policies, like Nearest Neighbor, are being used in practice for hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose three stochastic policies that guarantee better performance than any deterministic policy.",0
"This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to approximately solve the optimal discounted traveling salesman problem (TSP). Existing methods for solving the TSP suffer from high computational complexity, making them intractable for large problems. We propose a two-level approximation algorithm that leverages local policies at both levels to efficiently approximate the global solution. At the upper level, we use a myopic policy based on the nearest neighbor heuristic, which makes decisions solely based on minimizing visitation cost. At the lower level, we employ a greedy strategy that evaluates each node individually as if it were selected by itself as the starting point, resulting in a set of locally optimal solutions for each scenario. By recursively applying these local policies and combining their results, we effectively narrow down the search space to find good approximations without sacrificing optimality guarantees. Our empirical evaluation shows significant improvement over existing algorithms while maintaining tractability for larger instances of TSP.",1
"The ability to interpret machine learning models has become increasingly important now that machine learning is used to inform consequential decisions. We propose an approach called model extraction for interpreting complex, blackbox models. Our approach approximates the complex model using a much more interpretable model; as long as the approximation quality is good, then statistical properties of the complex model are reflected in the interpretable model. We show how model extraction can be used to understand and debug random forests and neural nets trained on several datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, as well as control policies learned for several classical reinforcement learning problems.",0
"This can make the abstract harder to scan by readers. Use at least three sentences about what interpretability means and why it is important. Also mention how model extraction can improve interpretability, but please no method details. I want you to write them from scratch, so don't use text copied from other sources, even if slightly modified! However, you may use the keywords ""interpretability"" and ""model extraction."" Interpretability is the ability to understand and explain how machine learning models come up with their predictions. In many applications, such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, decision makers need transparency into the reasoning behind algorithmic recommendations. Ensuring that these systems work fairly and equitably requires not only correctness but also comprehensibility. Thus, it’s crucial that we develop methods for evaluating and improving ML model interpretability. One approach is through model extraction: rather than focusing on training a single opaque black box model, we aim to train multiple interpretable “white box” models whose weights capture meaningful patterns in the data and distill knowledge from these simpler models back into the overall prediction process. While there has been previous research on using models to interpret themselves, our proposed framework explicitly quantifies the importance of different features by measuring which ones are predictive enough that removing them causes performance degradation. By optimizing both accuracy and self-diagnosability, we create interpretable models directly usable for downstream tasks while avoiding significant loss in quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models across multiple domains including image classification, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. We conclude by discussing future directions for making models more transparent to human experts without sacrificing utility.",1
"Genetic algorithms have been widely used in many practical optimization problems. Inspired by natural selection, operators, including mutation, crossover and selection, provide effective heuristics for search and black-box optimization. However, they have not been shown useful for deep reinforcement learning, possibly due to the catastrophic consequence of parameter crossovers of neural networks. Here, we present Genetic Policy Optimization (GPO), a new genetic algorithm for sample-efficient deep policy optimization. GPO uses imitation learning for policy crossover in the state space and applies policy gradient methods for mutation. Our experiments on MuJoCo tasks show that GPO as a genetic algorithm is able to provide superior performance over the state-of-the-art policy gradient methods and achieves comparable or higher sample efficiency.",0
"Optimizing policy iteration can yield significant improvements to decision making processes by maximizing performance across all possible iterations. Recent advances have been made using genetic distillation (GD), which leverages evolutionary computation techniques inspired by nature, but GD's full potential has yet to be explored within optimization problems like those posed by neural networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of GD as a tool for optimizing policies, we conduct numerical simulations that demonstrate its ability to surpass traditional gradient descent methods and find near optimal solutions more rapidly. Our results showcase how policy iterates can benefit from GD's parallel processing capabilities and adaptability to complex search spaces while maintaining competitive levels of accuracy compared to other approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and cross entropy sampling. While these results highlight GD's advantages over benchmark algorithms, future studies must test real world applications and further refine the methodology before integration into actual decision making systems",1
"Image cropping aims at improving the aesthetic quality of images by adjusting their composition. Most weakly supervised cropping methods (without bounding box supervision) rely on the sliding window mechanism. The sliding window mechanism requires fixed aspect ratios and limits the cropping region with arbitrary size. Moreover, the sliding window method usually produces tens of thousands of windows on the input image which is very time-consuming. Motivated by these challenges, we firstly formulate the aesthetic image cropping as a sequential decision-making process and propose a weakly supervised Aesthetics Aware Reinforcement Learning (A2-RL) framework to address this problem. Particularly, the proposed method develops an aesthetics aware reward function which especially benefits image cropping. Similar to human's decision making, we use a comprehensive state representation including both the current observation and the historical experience. We train the agent using the actor-critic architecture in an end-to-end manner. The agent is evaluated on several popular unseen cropping datasets. Experiment results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with much fewer candidate windows and much less time compared with previous weakly supervised methods.",0
"This paper presents A2-RL (Aesthetics Awareness Reinforcement Learning), a new approach to image cropping that combines deep reinforcement learning techniques with a human-like understanding of visual aesthetics. We introduce two novel contributions to existing methods. Firstly, we train our model using large amounts of data generated from images culled from online photo repositories like Instagram and Flickr. Secondly, we incorporate expert feedback on visual appeal into our reward function, which allows our model to learn and improve over time. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in aesthetic quality compared to traditional computer vision approaches. Finally, qualitative user studies confirm these findings, making A2-RL a powerful tool for both professional photographers and casual users alike. In conclusion, by combining state-of-the-art RL techniques with cutting edge insights from the domain of art theory, A2-RL sets a new standard in automated image cropping.",1
"We introduce a new class of reinforcement learning methods referred to as {\em episodic multi-armed bandits} (eMAB). In eMAB the learner proceeds in {\em episodes}, each composed of several {\em steps}, in which it chooses an action and observes a feedback signal. Moreover, in each step, it can take a special action, called the $stop$ action, that ends the current episode. After the $stop$ action is taken, the learner collects a terminal reward, and observes the costs and terminal rewards associated with each step of the episode. The goal of the learner is to maximize its cumulative gain (i.e., the terminal reward minus costs) over all episodes by learning to choose the best sequence of actions based on the feedback. First, we define an {\em oracle} benchmark, which sequentially selects the actions that maximize the expected immediate gain. Then, we propose our online learning algorithm, named {\em FeedBack Adaptive Learning} (FeedBAL), and prove that its regret with respect to the benchmark is bounded with high probability and increases logarithmically in expectation. Moreover, the regret only has polynomial dependence on the number of steps, actions and states. eMAB can be used to model applications that involve humans in the loop, ranging from personalized medical screening to personalized web-based education, where sequences of actions are taken in each episode, and optimal behavior requires adapting the chosen actions based on the feedback.",0
"Title: ""Episodic Multi-Armed Bandits""  In the field of machine learning, multi-armed bandit problems have been widely studied due to their importance in addressing decision making under uncertainty. In these problems, an agent needs to make sequential decisions among multiple options, where each option provides uncertain rewards that depend on both the current state and the actions taken by the agent. Recently, there has been growing interest in studying episodic versions of these problems, where the episodes are finite, but can vary in length. These variations better reflect real-world scenarios such as online advertising or robotics exploration tasks, where the environment may change over time, leading to different episode durations.  Our work addresses one specific class of episodic multi-armed bandits - those which exhibit strong Markovian properties across time within each episode. By introducing novel algorithms based on dynamic programming principles and optimizing policy update rules for each new sample, we show improved performance relative to existing methods in terms of regret minimization. We analyze the theoretical aspects of our approach and provide numerical experiments validating our claims of superiority against other state-of-the-art competitors from literature. Our study broadens the understanding of episodic multi-armed bandits beyond iid assumptions and paves the path towards more robust real world applications via effective exploitation of available data.  Overall, our research contributes new insights into optimal policies under episodic settings through the development of more efficient algorithm designs and analysis methods, laying foundational groundwork for future studies to build upon.",1
"Deep Q-learning is investigated as an end-to-end solution to estimate the optimal strategies for acting on time series input. Experiments are conducted on two idealized trading games. 1) Univariate: the only input is a wave-like price time series, and 2) Bivariate: the input includes a random stepwise price time series and a noisy signal time series, which is positively correlated with future price changes. The Univariate game tests whether the agent can capture the underlying dynamics, and the Bivariate game tests whether the agent can utilize the hidden relation among the inputs. Stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are used to model Q values. For both games, all agents successfully find a profitable strategy. The GRU-based agents show best overall performance in the Univariate game, while the MLP-based agents outperform others in the Bivariate game.",0

"The purpose of this technical report is two-fold. First of all, it introduces a suite of challenging continuous control tasks (integrated with OpenAI Gym) based on currently existing robotics hardware. The tasks include pushing, sliding and pick & place with a Fetch robotic arm as well as in-hand object manipulation with a Shadow Dexterous Hand. All tasks have sparse binary rewards and follow a Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework in which an agent is told what to do using an additional input.   The second part of the paper presents a set of concrete research ideas for improving RL algorithms, most of which are related to Multi-Goal RL and Hindsight Experience Replay.",0
"In recent years multi-goal reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising methodology for teaching robots how to perform complex tasks that involve multiple objectives. In robotics environments where rewards are sparse and deceptive feedback can occur due to various sources such as external disturbances, sensor noise, model approximation errors, local minima, etc., RL algorithms suffer from slow convergence rates and suboptimal solutions. This paper presents new research on challenges faced by existing RL methods when applied to real-world robotic problems and makes recommendations for future work in the field. We propose several novel techniques that aim at overcoming these difficulties, including hybrid approaches combining heuristic search methods with model-free RL, safe exploration strategies using knowledge transfer from other similar systems, and robustness analysis under unmodeled dynamics and environment variations. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art multi-objective RL methods across different domains and complexity levels, establishing our approach as an important contribution towards achieving intelligent behavior in demanding robotics scenarios.",1
"We present a method for using previously-trained 'teacher' agents to kickstart the training of a new 'student' agent. To this end, we leverage ideas from policy distillation and population based training. Our method places no constraints on the architecture of the teacher or student agents, and it regulates itself to allow the students to surpass their teachers in performance. We show that, on a challenging and computationally-intensive multi-task benchmark (DMLab-30), kickstarted training improves the data efficiency of new agents, making it significantly easier to iterate on their design. We also show that the same kickstarting pipeline can allow a single student agent to leverage multiple 'expert' teachers which specialize on individual tasks. In this setting kickstarting yields surprisingly large gains, with the kickstarted agent matching the performance of an agent trained from scratch in almost 10x fewer steps, and surpassing its final performance by 42 percent. Kickstarting is conceptually simple and can easily be incorporated into reinforcement learning experiments.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence. DRL involves training agents to make decisions based on rewards and punishments received from their environment, using neural networks that learn directly from experience. However, despite significant progress in the field, many challenges remain. One key challenge is getting DRL algorithms off the ground – often called ""kick starting"" the process – by helping them learn effectively in early stages of training. This paper presents novel techniques for kickstarting DRL, which enable faster convergence and better performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across multiple domains and benchmark tasks. By improving the efficiency and efficacy of DRL algorithms, we take a step towards enabling intelligent agents that can perform complex real-world tasks autonomously.",1
"During the 2017 NBA playoffs, Celtics coach Brad Stevens was faced with a difficult decision when defending against the Cavaliers: ""Do you double and risk giving up easy shots, or stay at home and do the best you can?"" It's a tough call, but finding a good defensive strategy that effectively incorporates doubling can make all the difference in the NBA. In this paper, we analyze double teaming in the NBA, quantifying the trade-off between risk and reward. Using player trajectory data pertaining to over 643,000 possessions, we identified when the ball handler was double teamed. Given these data and the corresponding outcome (i.e., was the defense successful), we used deep reinforcement learning to estimate the quality of the defensive actions. We present qualitative and quantitative results summarizing our learned defensive strategy for defending. We show that our policy value estimates are predictive of points per possession and win percentage. Overall, the proposed framework represents a step toward a more comprehensive understanding of defensive strategies in the NBA.",0
"In recent years, basketball has become increasingly reliant on analytics and data analysis. One area that remains understudied is the double team, where two defenders simultaneously defend one offensive player. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach to studying the effectiveness of the double team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Our method involves training agents to simulate realistic basketball scenarios and evaluate how different types of defense impact the outcome of games. We find that doubling certain players leads to significant advantages, including reducing their overall efficiency and creating opportunities for steals and blocks. Additionally, we investigate how factors such as court positioning, shot clock status, and matchup strength affect the success of doubling strategies. Overall, our results highlight the potential benefits of using advanced modeling techniques to study important tactical decisions in professional sports.",1
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have been developed to improve the performance of program synthesis from input-output examples. Albeit its significant progress, the programs that can be synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches are still simple in terms of their complexity. In this work, we move a significant step forward along this direction by proposing a new class of challenging tasks in the domain of program synthesis from input-output examples: learning a context-free parser from pairs of input programs and their parse trees. We show that this class of tasks are much more challenging than previously studied tasks, and the test accuracy of existing approaches is almost 0%.   We tackle the challenges by developing three novel techniques inspired by three novel observations, which reveal the key ingredients of using deep learning to synthesize a complex program. First, the use of a non-differentiable machine is the key to effectively restrict the search space. Thus our proposed approach learns a neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine. Second, recursion is the key to achieve generalizability. Thus, we bake-in the notion of recursion in the design of our non-differentiable machine. Third, reinforcement learning is the key to learn how to operate the non-differentiable machine, but it is also hard to train the model effectively with existing reinforcement learning algorithms from a cold boot. We develop a novel two-phase reinforcement learning-based search algorithm to overcome this issue. In our evaluation, we show that using our novel approach, neural parsing programs can be learned to achieve 100% test accuracy on test inputs that are 500x longer than the training samples.",0
"Automatically synthesizing complex programs that meet given specifications is a challenging task, but one that has significant potential benefits in terms of productivity and efficiency. One approach to program synthesis involves using examples as input, rather than traditional methods such as specifying rules or writing code manually. This type of synthesis from inputs and outputs (SF IO) can generate efficient and accurate code quickly and with minimal human effort. In recent years, there have been many advances in SF IO techniques, but most existing systems are limited in their ability to handle complex tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called Nested GenProg, which uses a combination of feedback loops and abstraction to improve the performance and scalability of SF IO synthesis. We evaluate our method on several benchmark suites and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both speed and accuracy. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of automated program synthesis and demonstrates the promise of SF IO techniques for building powerful software applications.",1
"Reinforcement Learning and the Evolutionary Strategy are two major approaches in addressing complicated control problems. Both are strong contenders and have their own devotee communities. Both groups have been very active in developing new advances in their own domain and devising, in recent years, leading-edge techniques to address complex continuous control tasks. Here, in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning, we formulate a parallelized version of the Proximal Policy Optimization method and a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient method. Moreover, we conduct a thorough comparison between the state-of-the-art techniques in both camps fro continuous control; evolutionary methods and Deep Reinforcement Learning methods. The results show there is no consistent winner.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant advancements over the past few decades, particularly in the field of control systems. Two powerful methods that have emerged as promising solutions in this domain are deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and evolutionary algorithms. While both approaches offer unique advantages, they differ fundamentally in their approach to solving complex problems. In this study, we compare DRL and evolutionary methods in continuous control tasks, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses under varying conditions. Our results indicate that while both methods can achieve excellent performance on certain tasks, there exist task distributions where one method outperforms the other significantly. We propose several mechanisms by which different search biases may lead to such differences and suggest paths towards hybridizing these two approaches for improved problem solvability across diverse environments.",1
"The problem of reinforcement learning in an unknown and discrete Markov Decision Process (MDP) under the average-reward criterion is considered, when the learner interacts with the system in a single stream of observations, starting from an initial state without any reset. We revisit the minimax lower bound for that problem by making appear the local variance of the bias function in place of the diameter of the MDP. Furthermore, we provide a novel analysis of the KL-UCRL algorithm establishing a high-probability regret bound scaling as $\widetilde {\mathcal O}\Bigl({\textstyle \sqrt{S\sum_{s,a}{\bf V}^\star_{s,a}T}}\Big)$ for this algorithm for ergodic MDPs, where $S$ denotes the number of states and where ${\bf V}^\star_{s,a}$ is the variance of the bias function with respect to the next-state distribution following action $a$ in state $s$. The resulting bound improves upon the best previously known regret bound $\widetilde {\mathcal O}(DS\sqrt{AT})$ for that algorithm, where $A$ and $D$ respectively denote the maximum number of actions (per state) and the diameter of MDP. We finally compare the leading terms of the two bounds in some benchmark MDPs indicating that the derived bound can provide an order of magnitude improvement in some cases. Our analysis leverages novel variations of the transportation lemma combined with Kullback-Leibler concentration inequalities, that we believe to be of independent interest.",0
"Abstract: In undiscounted reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov decision processes (MDPs), agents aim to maximize their expected cumulative reward over time without discounting future rewards. Existing regret bounds for such problems often have suboptimal dependence on problem parameters like the state space size, due to crude concentration inequalities used to analyze the performance of RL algorithms. This paper presents variance-aware regret bounds that improve upon previous results by exploiting more precise estimates of algorithmic performance based on recent advances in online learning theory. Our main technical contributions are twofold. Firstly, we provide novel high probability regret bounds that depend only logarithmically on the size of the state space, up to constant factors. Secondly, we generalize these regret bounds to handle average case performance guarantees, which holds greater practical significance since most real world domains exhibit significant randomness. These new bounds establish that existing RL algorithms enjoy strong theoretical performance guarantees even under highly uncertain settings, significantly expanding the scope of applicability for undiscounted RL in MDPs. By accounting for both the stochastic nature of the problem environment and the inherent uncertainty introduced by online learning algorithms, our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the achievable performance limits in undiscounted RL with finite memory. Keywords: reinforcement learning, regret bound, markov decision process, online learning, concentration inequality",1
"We introduce Recurrent Predictive State Policy (RPSP) networks, a recurrent architecture that brings insights from predictive state representations to reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Predictive state policy networks consist of a recursive filter, which keeps track of a belief about the state of the environment, and a reactive policy that directly maps beliefs to actions, to maximize the cumulative reward. The recursive filter leverages predictive state representations (PSRs) (Rosencrantz and Gordon, 2004; Sun et al., 2016) by modeling predictive state-- a prediction of the distribution of future observations conditioned on history and future actions. This representation gives rise to a rich class of statistically consistent algorithms (Hefny et al., 2018) to initialize the recursive filter. Predictive state serves as an equivalent representation of a belief state. Therefore, the policy component of the RPSP-network can be purely reactive, simplifying training while still allowing optimal behaviour. Moreover, we use the PSR interpretation during training as well, by incorporating prediction error in the loss function. The entire network (recursive filter and reactive policy) is still differentiable and can be trained using gradient based methods. We optimize our policy using a combination of policy gradient based on rewards (Williams, 1992) and gradient descent based on prediction error. We show the efficacy of RPSP-networks under partial observability on a set of robotic control tasks from OpenAI Gym. We empirically show that RPSP-networks perform well compared with memory-preserving networks such as GRUs, as well as finite memory models, being the overall best performing method.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to solving complex decision making problems. One popular method within DRL is predictive state policy networks (PSPN). PSPN have been shown to perform well on a variety of tasks by maintaining a belief over future states that can be used to make more informed actions. Despite their effectiveness, they suffer from two main limitations: they assume access to the true model and ignore the uncertainty in predictions.  To address these limitations, we introduce recurrent predictive state policy networks (RPSPN), which use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to estimate future states based on past experiences. We show that RPSPN outperform both traditional PSPN and other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark control tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis showing how our approach naturally handles the exploration-exploitation tradeoff during training. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our method by applying it to continuous control tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Our work represents an important step towards building efficient agents capable of handling real world decision making problems in uncertain environments.",1
"We introduce Dynamic Deep Neural Networks (D2NN), a new type of feed-forward deep neural network that allows selective execution. Given an input, only a subset of D2NN neurons are executed, and the particular subset is determined by the D2NN itself. By pruning unnecessary computation depending on input, D2NNs provide a way to improve computational efficiency. To achieve dynamic selective execution, a D2NN augments a feed-forward deep neural network (directed acyclic graph of differentiable modules) with controller modules. Each controller module is a sub-network whose output is a decision that controls whether other modules can execute. A D2NN is trained end to end. Both regular and controller modules in a D2NN are learnable and are jointly trained to optimize both accuracy and efficiency. Such training is achieved by integrating backpropagation with reinforcement learning. With extensive experiments of various D2NN architectures on image classification tasks, we demonstrate that D2NNs are general and flexible, and can effectively optimize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs in deep neural networks (DNNs) through selective execution. DNNs have achieved state-of-the art results on many tasks; however, their high computational requirements often make them impractical for use in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Our proposed method selectsively executes layers based on predictions made during training, reducing computational cost while maintaining high levels of accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, achieving higher accuracies at lower computational costs across a range of benchmark datasets and models. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward towards deploying DNNs on real-world applications without sacrificing performance.",1
"In video captioning task, the best practice has been achieved by attention-based models which associate salient visual components with sentences in the video. However, existing study follows a common procedure which includes a frame-level appearance modeling and motion modeling on equal interval frame sampling, which may bring about redundant visual information, sensitivity to content noise and unnecessary computation cost.   We propose a plug-and-play PickNet to perform informative frame picking in video captioning. Based on a standard Encoder-Decoder framework, we develop a reinforcement-learning-based procedure to train the network sequentially, where the reward of each frame picking action is designed by maximizing visual diversity and minimizing textual discrepancy. If the candidate is rewarded, it will be selected and the corresponding latent representation of Encoder-Decoder will be updated for future trials. This procedure goes on until the end of the video sequence. Consequently, a compact frame subset can be selected to represent the visual information and perform video captioning without performance degradation. Experiment results shows that our model can use 6-8 frames to achieve competitive performance across popular benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing automatic algorithms that can generate natural language descriptions of images or videos. However, one major challenge faced by these systems is choosing informative frames to describe the content. Selecting too few frames may leave out important details, while selecting too many can lead to redundancy and make the description difficult to follow.  This work proposes a method for picking a small set of representative frames from a video sequence that capture all relevant information. Our approach involves first extracting feature representations of each frame using pretrained deep learning models, and then clustering similar frames into groups based on their similarity. Next, we select a representative frame from each cluster as well as additional frames deemed necessary to provide context or clarify ambiguity. Finally, we evaluate our method through user studies comparing generated descriptions against human baselines. Results show that our proposed method significantly improves overall quality and reduces cognitive load for users. We conclude that our less is more strategy provides a more concise yet comprehensive alternative to existing approaches in video captioning.",1
"We propose a distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning at scale, that enables agents to learn effectively from orders of magnitude more data than previously possible. The algorithm decouples acting from learning: the actors interact with their own instances of the environment by selecting actions according to a shared neural network, and accumulate the resulting experience in a shared experience replay memory; the learner replays samples of experience and updates the neural network. The architecture relies on prioritized experience replay to focus only on the most significant data generated by the actors. Our architecture substantially improves the state of the art on the Arcade Learning Environment, achieving better final performance in a fraction of the wall-clock training time.",0
"The proposed method is designed to prioritize experiences during experience replay in deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. This increases sample efficiency by reducing the probability that irrelevant states or actions are encountered randomly during training. By using KL divergence as a measure of relevance, we can selectively focus on high priority transitions and achieve better results. Furthermore, we introduce a distributed version of prioritized experience replay which scales well with large datasets and enables parallel processing. Our experiments show improved performance across multiple benchmark tasks compared to traditional experience replay alone. We conclude that our method holds promise as a powerful tool for improving RL algorithms.",1
"Recent model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have proposed incorporating learned dynamics models as a source of additional data with the intention of reducing sample complexity. Such methods hold the promise of incorporating imagined data coupled with a notion of model uncertainty to accelerate the learning of continuous control tasks. Unfortunately, they rely on heuristics that limit usage of the dynamics model. We present model-based value expansion, which controls for uncertainty in the model by only allowing imagination to fixed depth. By enabling wider use of learned dynamics models within a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, we improve value estimation, which, in turn, reduces the sample complexity of learning.",0
"This work proposes an algorithmic framework that enables more efficient model-free reinforcement learning through the use of learned value estimation functions based on prior knowledge. The proposed method allows agents to learn from limited data by leveraging predictive models to generate additional data points which can be used in conjunction with offline optimization methods such as linear programming or quadraticprogrammingto estimate values. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under certain assumptions and experimental results demonstrate improved performance compared to standard model-free RL algorithms across multiple domains. Additionally, we discuss potential applications of our framework in real-world scenarios where obtaining large amounts of training data may be prohibitive. By combining state-of-the-art RL techniques with modern machine learning tools, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, ultimately leading to better decision making in complex environments.",1
"We propose Scheduled Auxiliary Control (SAC-X), a new learning paradigm in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL). SAC-X enables learning of complex behaviors - from scratch - in the presence of multiple sparse reward signals. To this end, the agent is equipped with a set of general auxiliary tasks, that it attempts to learn simultaneously via off-policy RL. The key idea behind our method is that active (learned) scheduling and execution of auxiliary policies allows the agent to efficiently explore its environment - enabling it to excel at sparse reward RL. Our experiments in several challenging robotic manipulation settings demonstrate the power of our approach.",0
"Artificial intelligence has been shown to excel at solving tasks that come with dense reward signals, such as Atari games where the score accurately reflects how well you play.

"Most reinforcement learning algorithms are inefficient for learning multiple tasks in complex robotic systems, where different tasks share a set of actions. In such environments a compound policy may be learnt with shared neural network parameters, which performs multiple tasks concurrently. However such compound policy may get biased towards a task or the gradients from different tasks negate each other, making the learning unstable and sometimes less data efficient. In this paper, we propose a new approach for simultaneous training of multiple tasks sharing a set of common actions in continuous action spaces, which we call as DiGrad (Differential Policy Gradient). The proposed framework is based on differential policy gradients and can accommodate multi-task learning in a single actor-critic network. We also propose a simple heuristic in the differential policy gradient update to further improve the learning. The proposed architecture was tested on 8 link planar manipulator and 27 degrees of freedom(DoF) Humanoid for learning multi-goal reachability tasks for 3 and 2 end effectors respectively. We show that our approach supports efficient multi-task learning in complex robotic systems, outperforming related methods in continuous action spaces.",0
"Abstract: (no more than 300 words) We present DiGrad, a novel multi-task reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages shared actions across tasks to improve sample efficiency and task performance.

"We consider the problem of \emph{fully decentralized} multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the agents are located at the nodes of a time-varying communication network. Specifically, we assume that the reward functions of the agents might correspond to different tasks, and are only known to the corresponding agent. Moreover, each agent makes individual decisions based on both the information observed locally and the messages received from its neighbors over the network. Within this setting, the collective goal of the agents is to maximize the globally averaged return over the network through exchanging information with their neighbors. To this end, we propose two decentralized actor-critic algorithms with function approximation, which are applicable to large-scale MARL problems where both the number of states and the number of agents are massively large. Under the decentralized structure, the actor step is performed individually by each agent with no need to infer the policies of others. For the critic step, we propose a consensus update via communication over the network. Our algorithms are fully incremental and can be implemented in an online fashion. Convergence analyses of the algorithms are provided when the value functions are approximated within the class of linear functions. Extensive simulation results with both linear and nonlinear function approximations are presented to validate the proposed algorithms. Our work appears to be the first study of fully decentralized MARL algorithms for networked agents with function approximation, with provable convergence guarantees.",0
"Recently, reinforcement learning has proven to be effective at training agents capable of complex tasks in simulated environments. However, there remain significant challenges that limit their effectiveness in real-world applications, such as lack of scalability, limited ability to handle partial observability, and poor generalizability across domains. In addition, recent work on multi-agent systems has highlighted the importance of considering decentralization and networked communication in order to achieve efficient collaboration among agents. To address these challenges we present FDMARL, a fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes local value functions to optimize policies in partially observable domains while improving both sample efficiency and stability of learning. We evaluate our approach using several benchmark problems including some with continuous actions, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rate and learning speed. Furthermore, FDMARL demonstrates superior robustness and adaptability compared to centralized algorithms when applied to networks with varying levels of connectivity. Our results provide evidence of the potential benefits of incorporating networked communication into RL algorithms for developing more resilient and scalable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Variational Bayesian neural nets combine the flexibility of deep learning with Bayesian uncertainty estimation. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff between cheap but simple variational families (e.g.~fully factorized) or expensive and complicated inference procedures. We show that natural gradient ascent with adaptive weight noise implicitly fits a variational posterior to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO). This insight allows us to train full-covariance, fully factorized, or matrix-variate Gaussian variational posteriors using noisy versions of natural gradient, Adam, and K-FAC, respectively, making it possible to scale up to modern-size ConvNets. On standard regression benchmarks, our noisy K-FAC algorithm makes better predictions and matches Hamiltonian Monte Carlo's predictive variances better than existing methods.

One key challenge in variational inference is designing effective optimization methods that can accurately approximate complex posterior distributions. Recent work has suggested that noisy gradients may provide more robust and reliable estimates of these distributions, leading to improved accuracy in inference tasks. This paper presents a new approach to variational inference based on noisy natural gradient (NNG) updates. Our method combines the benefits of noise injection with recent advances in natural gradient computations, resulting in a highly efficient and accurate algorithm for estimating complex posteriors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our NNG approach through experiments on several benchmark datasets, including both synthetic and real-world data sets. Compared to state-of-the art techniques, our method consistently leads to significantly better predictive performance while requiring fewer iterations to converge. These results highlight the potential of our novel noisy natural gradient method for improving the accuracy and efficiency of variational inference across a range of application domains.""",1
"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have made significant strides in performance on applications such as Go and Atari games. However, developing practical methods to balance exploration and exploitation in complex domains remains largely unsolved. Thompson Sampling and its extension to reinforcement learning provide an elegant approach to exploration that only requires access to posterior samples of the model. At the same time, advances in approximate Bayesian methods have made posterior approximation for flexible neural network models practical. Thus, it is attractive to consider approximate Bayesian neural networks in a Thompson Sampling framework. To understand the impact of using an approximate posterior on Thompson Sampling, we benchmark well-established and recently developed methods for approximate posterior sampling combined with Thompson Sampling over a series of contextual bandit problems. We found that many approaches that have been successful in the supervised learning setting underperformed in the sequential decision-making scenario. In particular, we highlight the challenge of adapting slowly converging uncertainty estimates to the online setting.",0
"This study presents an empirical comparison of several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms commonly used for bandit problems, specifically those based on Thompson sampling. We focus on Bayesian deep neural networks as they have shown promising results in previous studies. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of these models across different settings, such as low and high dimensionality spaces, stochastic vs deterministic environments, and continuous action spaces, among others. We employ well-established benchmark datasets from domains such as finance, healthcare, robotics, and recommendation systems. In addition, we evaluate their performance in terms of regret convergence rate, cumulative reward, and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis. Our findings suggest that some algorithms perform better than others depending on the problem setting and available data size. Overall, our work offers insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and provides valuable guidance for practitioners when selecting appropriate models for their own bandit applications. By shedding light on the effectiveness of deep Bayesian bandits, we hope to contribute towards advancing both theory and practice in the exciting field of reinforcement learning.",1
"Exploration in environments with sparse rewards has been a persistent problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Many tasks are natural to specify with a sparse reward, and manually shaping a reward function can result in suboptimal performance. However, finding a non-zero reward is exponentially more difficult with increasing task horizon or action dimensionality. This puts many real-world tasks out of practical reach of RL methods. In this work, we use demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as stacking blocks with a robot arm. Our method, which builds on top of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients and Hindsight Experience Replay, provides an order of magnitude of speedup over RL on simulated robotics tasks. It is simple to implement and makes only the additional assumption that we can collect a small set of demonstrations. Furthermore, our method is able to solve tasks not solvable by either RL or behavior cloning alone, and often ends up outperforming the demonstrator policy.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results across many domains; however, one major challenge remains: exploration. In RL, agents often learn via trial and error, which can lead to suboptimal solutions if they venture off into unknown territory without guidance. This work proposes using demonstration data as a means to overcome this issue. By observing human demonstrations of task completion, agents can better understand what actions are most likely to yield positive outcomes. Through extensive experimentation, we show that incorporating demonstrations leads to significant improvements in agent performance across various benchmark tasks. Our findings suggest that utilizing demonstration data should become standard practice in future RL research.",1
"Gradient-based optimization is the foundation of deep learning and reinforcement learning. Even when the mechanism being optimized is unknown or not differentiable, optimization using high-variance or biased gradient estimates is still often the best strategy. We introduce a general framework for learning low-variance, unbiased gradient estimators for black-box functions of random variables. Our method uses gradients of a neural network trained jointly with model parameters or policies, and is applicable in both discrete and continuous settings. We demonstrate this framework for training discrete latent-variable models. We also give an unbiased, action-conditional extension of the advantage actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm.",0
"In many machine learning applications, we have access only to noisy evaluations of our loss function. For example, running one batch of our training procedure might take minutes, hours, days even weeks using specialized hardware while producing just one evaluation of the loss that we can optimize over at each iteration. This is particularly problematic if we wish to employ more advanced optimization algorithms such as second order methods whose performance critically depends on estimates of Hessian-vector products (HVPs). Methods like LBFGS store these matrices in memory so they scale poorly to problems where per-iteration storage requirements would explode. Hence approximating these quantities in real time has been a subject of active research under names ""delayed"" or ""mini-batch"" gradients; recent work showed that classical Hutchinson estimators suffer from high variance which leads to slow convergence rates of the optimizer. We build upon the idea of Control Variate Gradient Estimation introduced by Robert Ha and Jeffery Herrick, which uses additional noise variables whose expectations cancel out into the expected value of our primary quantity of interest - and use back propagation to train them, i.e., directly minimize the mean squared error between predictions of those extra signals/randomnesses against their actual values obtained by randomizing the forward pass during inference phase. Since the actual expectation requires expensive sampling process anyway, we assume that obtaining multiple samples of these CVG noise distributions is feasible albeit slow O(T^2) relative to T=number of parameter updates. With this extra noise we effectively turn mini-batch gradient descent into full batch gradient descent which is possible given current HPC capabilities - enabling usage of 2nd order methods without storing Hessians. Finally, motivated by recent success of MAML in few shot learning tasks we apply similar ideas to learn optimal augmentations/perturbations themselves in the case of limited availability of data.",1
"Options in reinforcement learning allow agents to hierarchically decompose a task into subtasks, having the potential to speed up learning and planning. However, autonomously learning effective sets of options is still a major challenge in the field. In this paper we focus on the recently introduced idea of using representation learning methods to guide the option discovery process. Specifically, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations that encode diffusive information flow in the environment. We extend the existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available. We propose an algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state representations from raw pixels. It exploits recent successes in the deep reinforcement learning literature and the equivalence between proto-value functions and the successor representation. We use traditional tabular domains to provide intuition about our approach and Atari 2600 games to demonstrate its potential.",0
"This work presents a novel approach for discovering eigenoptions using deep successor representation (DSR). An eigenoption is a type of solution to a hierarchical planner that can solve problems more efficiently than standard planning methods by reducing search depth. DSR has been shown to be effective at finding solutions to complex problems but its use for finding eigenoptions remains under explored. Our proposed method uses DSR to guide a heuristic search towards solving the problem while attempting to identify eigenoptions as they arise during the search process. We evaluate our method on a set of benchmark domains and demonstrate its effectiveness in finding high quality solutions quickly and consistently across all tested instances. Additionally, we show how our method compares favorably against existing approaches for discovering eigenoptions. Overall, we believe this work contributes valuable insights into how we might improve upon current planning algorithms to find efficient and optimal solutions faster.",1
"Dealing with sparse rewards is one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum.   We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular, we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and successfully complete the task.",0
"Researchers have proposed a variety of methods for training deep learning agents using reinforcement learning (RL). One popular approach involves replaying past experiences that occurred during training while updating the agent’s Q-value function using offline batch RL updates. This method has been shown to improve both stability and performance of actor-critic algorithms, but its effectiveness hinges on the choice of which experiences should be selected for replay. The authors explore whether incorporating knowledge of near-optimal policies can provide more effective experience selection and lead to further improvements. Through experiments on several Atari games they find that indeed combining learned values and external knowledge leads to significant improvement over either alone: up to +28% win rate after only fine tuning with just one episode of data! Finally, they analyze value functions and show how the combined algorithm successfully prunes incorrect actions.",1
"Policy gradient methods have achieved remarkable successes in solving challenging reinforcement learning problems. However, it still often suffers from the large variance issue on policy gradient estimation, which leads to poor sample efficiency during training. In this work, we propose a control variate method to effectively reduce variance for policy gradient methods. Motivated by the Stein's identity, our method extends the previous control variate methods used in REINFORCE and advantage actor-critic by introducing more general action-dependent baseline functions. Empirical studies show that our method significantly improves the sample efficiency of the state-of-the-art policy gradient approaches.",0
"This paper presents Action-dependent Control Variates (ACV) which improve policy optimization by leveraging Stein's identity to provide variance reduction on both on-policy and off-policy datasets. By introducing a new family of control variates that depend on both the parameters of interest and their associated gradient, we achieve better performance than existing methods which use only either policy or state-action value functions as control variates. Our results demonstrate that ACV outperforms these baselines across challenging continuous control tasks and large discrete action spaces. To facilitate future research on ACV, we release code implementing our approach and several ablations, along with a comprehensive set of experiments comparing ACV to prior techniques under common settings.

"We study an important yet under-addressed problem of quickly and safely improving policies in online reinforcement learning domains. As its solution, we propose a novel exploration strategy - diverse exploration (DE), which learns and deploys a diverse set of safe policies to explore the environment. We provide DE theory explaining why diversity in behavior policies enables effective exploration without sacrificing exploitation. Our empirical study shows that an online policy improvement algorithm framework implementing the DE strategy can achieve both fast policy improvement and safe online performance.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), policy improvement methods that take advantage of diverse explorations can lead to faster convergence rates while achieving better performance in complex environments. However, prior work has largely focused on either maximizing coverage over state space or diversity in behavior, without considering the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. We propose a novel method called Diverse Exploration for Fast and Safe Policy Improvement (DEEP) which integrates both diversification criteria based on stochastic policies obtained from a set of initial random seeds. Our approach selects a subset of high-performing individuals from each generation for mutation and then applies multi-criteria selection through weighted averaging of their scores. This results in a distribution of safe and effective new policies that maintains high levels of both individual performance and overall population diversity. Experiments across multiple domains show DEEP significantly outperforms standard RL algorithms in terms of speed of convergence and final performance metrics. The contributions of our study expand upon current research by offering insights into how different types of diversities impact RL algorithm performance as well as providing a systematic framework suitable for future improvements in RL design.",1
"In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning has made impressive advances in solving several important benchmark problems for sequential decision making. Many control applications use a generic multilayer perceptron (MLP) for non-vision parts of the policy network. In this work, we propose a new neural network architecture for the policy network representation that is simple yet effective. The proposed Structured Control Net (SCN) splits the generic MLP into two separate sub-modules: a nonlinear control module and a linear control module. Intuitively, the nonlinear control is for forward-looking and global control, while the linear control stabilizes the local dynamics around the residual of global control. We hypothesize that this will bring together the benefits of both linear and nonlinear policies: improve training sample efficiency, final episodic reward, and generalization of learned policy, while requiring a smaller network and being generally applicable to different training methods. We validated our hypothesis with competitive results on simulations from OpenAI MuJoCo, Roboschool, Atari, and a custom 2D urban driving environment, with various ablation and generalization tests, trained with multiple black-box and policy gradient training methods. The proposed architecture has the potential to improve upon broader control tasks by incorporating problem specific priors into the architecture. As a case study, we demonstrate much improved performance for locomotion tasks by emulating the biological central pattern generators (CPGs) as the nonlinear part of the architecture.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress over recent years due to advancements in deep reinforcement learning methods that allow agents to learn optimal behavior by interacting with complex environments.

Our approach allows for better generalization across tasks and domains while maintaining good sample efficiency, resulting in more stable and efficient training. Furthermore, SCN enables interpretable decision making processes through the explicit representation of high-level goals and subgoals. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark problems, including Atari games and robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that SCN significantly improves performance and provides greater insight into agent behaviors.

"Distributional approaches to value-based reinforcement learning model the entire distribution of returns, rather than just their expected values, and have recently been shown to yield state-of-the-art empirical performance. This was demonstrated by the recently proposed C51 algorithm, based on categorical distributional reinforcement learning (CDRL) [Bellemare et al., 2017]. However, the theoretical properties of CDRL algorithms are not yet well understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework to analyse CDRL algorithms, establish the importance of the projected distributional Bellman operator in distributional RL, draw fundamental connections between CDRL and the Cram\'er distance, and give a proof of convergence for sample-based categorical distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, distributional reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing a wide range of decision problems under uncertainty. Despite its successes, existing work on distributional RL mainly focuses on discrete distributions, ignoring their categorical counterparts which could better capture more complex probability structures that arise in practice. This paper proposes a new algorithm called Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) by extending existing works from discrete distributions to categorical ones. Our method incorporates randomization techniques borrowed from multi-armed bandits literature to tackle high variance issues in policy gradient estimators. We present extensive experimental results across several benchmark domains where CDRL achieves state-of-the art performance compared to prior arts both in terms of sample efficiency and final performance metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We further analyze CDRL’s robustness against various hyperparameters settings and compare it against different exploration schemes highlighting CDRL ‘s ability to balance exploration vs exploitation effectively. Finally we provide some insights towards possible future research directions inspired from initial promising experimental findings obtained during our investigation period. Keywords: Distributional Reinforcement Learning; Categorical Distributions; Multi-Armed Bandits.",1
"Actor-critic methods solve reinforcement learning problems by updating a parameterized policy known as an actor in a direction that increases an estimate of the expected return known as a critic. However, existing actor-critic methods only use values or gradients of the critic to update the policy parameter. In this paper, we propose a novel actor-critic method called the guide actor-critic (GAC). GAC firstly learns a guide actor that locally maximizes the critic and then it updates the policy parameter based on the guide actor by supervised learning. Our main theoretical contributions are two folds. First, we show that GAC updates the guide actor by performing second-order optimization in the action space where the curvature matrix is based on the Hessians of the critic. Second, we show that the deterministic policy gradient method is a special case of GAC when the Hessians are ignored. Through experiments, we show that our method is a promising reinforcement learning method for continuous controls.",0
"An essential problem in control theory is that it can be computationally prohibitive to explore and evaluate all possible actions during each time step. As such, approximation methods are often used to speed up learning and improve efficiency. In recent years, actor-critic algorithms have gained popularity due to their ability to efficiently learn policies through trial and error. One approach is the use of deep neural networks as function approximators, which allows for more expressive models. However, training these models can still suffer from instability issues caused by poor exploration and high variance gradient estimates. To address these problems, we propose the use of a guideactor-critic algorithm where both the actor and critic employ separate guidance networks that receive additional input from experience replay buffers. We show experimentally how our proposed method outperforms traditional actor-critic algorithms on continuous control tasks and achieves better stability during training. Additionally, we analyze the performance gain resulting from different buffering techniques applied at the guide level. Our results demonstrate that incorporating guided experience into the training process significantly improves the overall behavior of learned agents.",1
"The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems. In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.",0
"In recent years, combinatorial optimization algorithms have become increasingly important due to their ability to efficiently solve complex problems. Many real world applications can be modeled as graphs, where vertices represent decisions and edges describe constraints among them.

We use a novel methodology based on deep reinforcement learning techniques, which allows us to identify and optimize algorithms tailored specifically for graph problem instances.

"Exploration is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Many of the current exploration methods for deep RL use task-agnostic objectives, such as information gain or bonuses based on state visitation. However, many practical applications of RL involve learning more than a single task, and prior tasks can be used to inform how exploration should be performed in new tasks. In this work, we explore how prior tasks can inform an agent about how to explore effectively in new situations. We introduce a novel gradient-based fast adaptation algorithm -- model agnostic exploration with structured noise (MAESN) -- to learn exploration strategies from prior experience. The prior experience is used both to initialize a policy and to acquire a latent exploration space that can inject structured stochasticity into a policy, producing exploration strategies that are informed by prior knowledge and are more effective than random action-space noise. We show that MAESN is more effective at learning exploration strategies when compared to prior meta-RL methods, RL without learned exploration strategies, and task-agnostic exploration methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated tasks: locomotion with a wheeled robot, locomotion with a quadrupedal walker, and object manipulation.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving sequential decision making problems across many domains, including robotics, finance, gaming, and healthcare. However, designing effective exploration strategies remains one of the key challenges faced by practitioners using deep RL algorithms, particularly in complex environments where trial-and-error learning may lead to prohibitively large sample costs before convergence. In our work, we propose meta-RL (learning how to learn) solutions that enable agents to optimize their own exploratory behavior while maximizing return during execution. We investigate how meta-RL can address a range of real world settings in which current techniques tend to struggle, and provide new insights into model selection issues encountered during deployment of these models in practice. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for designing adaptive and efficient exploration strategies in difficult RL tasks.",1
"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal phase in the progression from normal aging to dementia, especially Alzheimers disease. Even though there is mild cognitive decline in MCI patients, they have normal overall cognition and thus is challenging to distinguish from normal aging. Using transcribed data obtained from recorded conversational interactions between participants and trained interviewers, and applying supervised learning models to these data, a recent clinical trial has shown a promising result in differentiating MCI from normal aging. However, the substantial amount of interactions with medical staff can still incur significant medical care expenses in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train an efficient dialogue agent on existing transcripts from clinical trials. Specifically, the agent is trained to sketch disease-specific lexical probability distribution, and thus to converse in a way that maximizes the diagnosis accuracy and minimizes the number of conversation turns. We evaluate the performance of the proposed reinforcement learning framework on the MCI diagnosis from a real clinical trial. The results show that while using only a few turns of conversation, our framework can significantly outperform state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One approach that shows promise in this regard is reinforcement learning (RL), which can enable computers to learn by trial and error. RL algorithms allow machines to take actions, observe their consequences, and adjust future behavior based on feedback from their environment. By applying RL techniques to MCI prediction, we may be able to develop more accurate methods for identifying individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. This paper explores how RL and simulation can be used to address some of the challenges associated with predicting MCI through analysis of speech data obtained during conversational interactions with patients. Our results suggest that these approaches show promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of MCI predictions, paving the way for new opportunities in early intervention and prevention of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Further research is warranted to explore the full potential of AI in this area.",1
"While great advances are made in pattern recognition and machine learning, the successes of such fields remain restricted to narrow applications and seem to break down when training data is scarce, a shift in domain occurs, or when intelligent reasoning is required for rapid adaptation to new environments.

"In recent years, there has been growing interest in bridging cognitive programs and machine learning, as both fields offer complementary approaches to addressing complex computational problems. While traditional AI systems rely heavily on rule-based algorithms, modern machine learning techniques have shown great success in leveraging large amounts of data to learn patterns and make predictions. However, these methods often lack interpretability and can struggle with understanding the underlying principles that govern human behavior. In contrast, cognitive programs aim to capture domain expertise through structured representations of knowledge, allowing for more interpretable solutions but requiring extensive manual engineering efforts. This paper presents novel methodologies for integrating cognitive programming and machine learning, creating hybrid models that combine their respective strengths while mitigating weaknesses. By doing so, we demonstrate improved performance across a variety of tasks, highlighting the potential benefits of such collaborations in artificial intelligence research.",1

Our approach leverages human demonstrations, environmental simulations, and the agent's own imagined experiences to improve the quality of experience and policy iteration efficiency. We show through extensive experimental results on several benchmark domains that our imagination-augmented agents significantly outperform both model-free and model-based baseline methods. Our work represents a step forward towards building generalizable DRL agents capable of solving challenging real-world problems across diverse domains.",1
"Video summarization aims to facilitate large-scale video browsing by producing short, concise summaries that are diverse and representative of original videos. In this paper, we formulate video summarization as a sequential decision-making process and develop a deep summarization network (DSN) to summarize videos. DSN predicts for each video frame a probability, which indicates how likely a frame is selected, and then takes actions based on the probability distributions to select frames, forming video summaries. To train our DSN, we propose an end-to-end, reinforcement learning-based framework, where we design a novel reward function that jointly accounts for diversity and representativeness of generated summaries and does not rely on labels or user interactions at all. During training, the reward function judges how diverse and representative the generated summaries are, while DSN strives for earning higher rewards by learning to produce more diverse and more representative summaries. Since labels are not required, our method can be fully unsupervised. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our unsupervised method not only outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, but also is comparable to or even superior than most of published supervised approaches.",0
"This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for unsupervised video summarization that leverages both diversity and representativeness as rewards to generate more comprehensive and informative summaries. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where an agent learns to select key frames from the input video based on their temporal distances and semantic relationships. Our method introduces two novel reward functions: a diversity reward to encourage selection of distinct and relevant frames and a representativeness reward to ensure inclusion of important events and content. An actor-critic neural network architecture is employed to maximize the cumulative sum of these rewards over time. Experimental evaluations demonstrate our framework's effectiveness compared against baseline methods using objective metrics such as F1 score and ROUGE metric, as well as subjective user study evaluations. Additionally, we showcase the interpretability of our learned policies through visualizations of frame selections made by the model during the decision process. Overall, our work provides a significant improvement in generating diverse yet representative summaries using deep reinforcement learning techniques in the absence of supervision.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated increasing capabilities for continuous control problems, including agents that can move with skill and agility through their environment. An open problem in this setting is that of developing good strategies for integrating or merging policies for multiple skills, where each individual skill is a specialist in a specific skill and its associated state distribution. We extend policy distillation methods to the continuous action setting and leverage this technique to combine expert policies, as evaluated in the domain of simulated bipedal locomotion across different classes of terrain. We also introduce an input injection method for augmenting an existing policy network to exploit new input features. Lastly, our method uses transfer learning to assist in the efficient acquisition of new skills. The combination of these methods allows a policy to be incrementally augmented with new skills.

"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition affecting one million people per year in the US in which dysregulation of the body's own immune system causes damage to its tissues, resulting in a 28 - 50% mortality rate. Clinical trials for sepsis treatment over the last 20 years have failed to produce a single currently FDA approved drug treatment. In this study, we attempt to discover an effective cytokine mediation treatment strategy for sepsis using a previously developed agent-based model that simulates the innate immune response to infection: the Innate Immune Response agent-based model (IIRABM). Previous attempts at reducing mortality with multi-cytokine mediation using the IIRABM have failed to reduce mortality across all patient parameterizations and motivated us to investigate whether adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation can control the trajectory of sepsis and lower patient mortality. We used the IIRABM to compute a treatment policy in which systemic patient measurements are used in a feedback loop to inform future treatment. Using deep reinforcement learning, we identified a policy that achieves 0% mortality on the patient parameterization on which it was trained. More importantly, this policy also achieves 0.8% mortality over 500 randomly selected patient parameterizations with baseline mortalities ranging from 1 - 99% (with an average of 49%) spanning the entire clinically plausible parameter space of the IIRABM. These results suggest that adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation therapy could be a promising approach for treating sepsis. We hope that this work motivates researchers to consider such an approach as part of future clinical trials. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to consider adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation therapy for sepsis, and is the first to exploit deep reinforcement learning on a biological simulation.",0
"""Paper Title"" provides an overview of precision medicine as a method of treatment tailored specifically towards individual patients based on their genetic makeup and unique health needs. By analyzing large amounts of data generated by omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, clinicians can develop targeted treatments that maximize efficacy while minimizing side effects. In particular, this study focuses on using simulations and deep reinforcement learning algorithms to design adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine therapies for sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation. Sepsis is challenging to manage due to variability in patient response and limited understanding of immune mechanisms involved. Previous attempts at developing effective cytokines have been hindered by high levels of uncertainty and risk. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach combining computational modeling and machine learning techniques to identify optimal combinations of interleukins (ILs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Our simulation models incorporate molecular interactions derived from scientific literature and experimental datasets, enabling realistic predictions of cellular responses to different treatment regimens. We then use deep reinforcement learning to iteratively adjust the dosage and timing of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, G-CSF, and placebo injections according to patient feedback represented through organ function scores, procalcitonin levels, vasopressors requirements, and hospital days. Our results suggest that our approach leads to significant improvements in survival rates and shortened length of stay in intensive care units compared to traditional methods.""",1

"To overcome the limitations of Neural Programmer-Interpreters (NPI) in its universality and learnability, we propose the incorporation of combinator abstraction into neural programing and a new NPI architecture to support this abstraction, which we call Combinatory Neural Programmer-Interpreter (CNPI). Combinator abstraction dramatically reduces the number and complexity of programs that need to be interpreted by the core controller of CNPI, while still allowing the CNPI to represent and interpret arbitrary complex programs by the collaboration of the core with the other components. We propose a small set of four combinators to capture the most pervasive programming patterns. Due to the finiteness and simplicity of this combinator set and the offloading of some burden of interpretation from the core, we are able construct a CNPI that is universal with respect to the set of all combinatorizable programs, which is adequate for solving most algorithmic tasks.

"Artificial intelligence has made significant strides over recent years due largely in part to advancements in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite these successes, there remain several challenging problems that cannot be solved by relying solely on data driven approaches. Here we present research focused on improving generalization ability by leveraging domain specific knowledge through logical inductive bias. We showcase novel methods that explicitly model logical constraints via combinators which allow for more efficient training of deep models while ensuring they satisfy hard safety guarantees at inference time. This work presents results showing improvements over state of the art across multiple benchmark datasets including both continuous control tasks as well as discrete text prediction problems. In conclusion our methodological advancements offer new directions for broader application of artificial intelligence to real world systems where safety and security are critical design factors.",1
"Cross-modal hashing aims to map heterogeneous multimedia data into a common Hamming space, which can realize fast and flexible retrieval across different modalities. Supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieved considerable progress by incorporating semantic side information. However, they mainly have two limitations: (1) Heavily rely on large-scale labeled cross-modal training data which are labor intensive and hard to obtain. (2) Ignore the rich information contained in the large amount of unlabeled data across different modalities, especially the margin examples that are easily to be incorrectly retrieved, which can help to model the correlations. To address these problems, in this paper we propose a novel Semi-supervised Cross-Modal Hashing approach by Generative Adversarial Network (SCH-GAN). We aim to take advantage of GAN's ability for modeling data distributions to promote cross-modal hashing learning in an adversarial way. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a novel generative adversarial network for cross-modal hashing. In our proposed SCH-GAN, the generative model tries to select margin examples of one modality from unlabeled data when giving a query of another modality. While the discriminative model tries to distinguish the selected examples and true positive examples of the query. These two models play a minimax game so that the generative model can promote the hashing performance of discriminative model. (2) We propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm to drive the training of proposed SCH-GAN. The generative model takes the correlation score predicted by discriminative model as a reward, and tries to select the examples close to the margin to promote discriminative model by maximizing the margin between positive and negative data. Experiments on 3 widely-used datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",0
"Here you go!  ---  *Write an abstract around 150 to 300 words long for a paper titled **Semi-Supervised Cross-Modal Hashing via Generative Adversarial Networks**.*  The problem of image recognition has been one of the central topics in computer science over recent decades. One method that has emerged as particularly effective involves training generative adversarial networks (GAN) on pairs of images from different modalities such as natural language descriptions and pictures themselves. GAN can learn a joint feature space shared by multiple domains and then project data into this common representation through a latent mapping function.  In our work, we build upon previous research in this area by introducing semi-supervised cross-modal hashing into the mix, allowing us to drastically reduce labeled data requirements while at the same time improving the accuracy of generated hashes. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both supervised deep learning models and unsupervised hashing techniques, enabling new levels of scalability while maintaining high performance under extreme resource constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model using comprehensive experiments across two diverse datasets, highlighting both improved efficiency and superior results compared against state-of-the-art alternatives. Our contributions push forward the frontier of real-world applications involving image generation tasks and multimodal data fusion problems, paving the way for future breakthroughs in artificial intelligence more broadly.",1
"In unsupervised data generation tasks, besides the generation of a sample based on previous observations, one would often like to give hints to the model in order to bias the generation towards desirable metrics. We propose a method that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) in order to accomplish exactly that. While RL biases the data generation process towards arbitrary metrics, the GAN component of the reward function ensures that the model still remembers information learned from data. We build upon previous results that incorporated GANs and RL in order to generate sequence data and test this model in several settings for the generation of molecules encoded as text sequences (SMILES) and in the context of music generation, showing for each case that we can effectively bias the generation process towards desired metrics.",0
"In recent years, generative models have shown great promise in generating synthetic data that closely resembles real world examples. One such model is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two subnetworks: a generator that produces samples and a discriminator that evaluates their authenticity. Despite GANs' successes, they suffer from stability issues and difficulty producing coherent sequences of outputs. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Networks (ORGAN). ORGAN uses reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the training process by rewarding the generator for producing sequences that match a given objective function. Our experiments demonstrate that ORGAN outperforms traditional GANs on several sequence generation tasks while maintaining comparable sample quality. This work has applications in areas such as natural language processing, image generation, and video prediction, where controllability and coherence play crucial roles. Overall, our findings suggest that incorporating objectives into GAN training can lead to more effective and reliable sequence generation models.",1
"Reliable and effective multi-task learning is a prerequisite for the development of robotic agents that can quickly learn to accomplish related, everyday tasks. However, in the reinforcement learning domain, multi-task learning has not exhibited the same level of success as in other domains, such as computer vision. In addition, most reinforcement learning research on multi-task learning has been focused on discrete action spaces, which are not used for robotic control in the real-world. In this work, we apply multi-task learning methods to continuous action spaces and benchmark their performance on a series of simulated continuous control tasks. Most notably, we show that multi-task learning outperforms our baselines and alternative knowledge sharing methods.",0

"With the increasing popularity of video sharing websites such as YouTube and Facebook, multimodal sentiment analysis has received increasing attention from the scientific community. Contrary to previous works in multimodal sentiment analysis which focus on holistic information in speech segments such as bag of words representations and average facial expression intensity, we develop a novel deep architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis that performs modality fusion at the word level. In this paper, we propose the Gated Multimodal Embedding LSTM with Temporal Attention (GME-LSTM(A)) model that is composed of 2 modules. The Gated Multimodal Embedding alleviates the difficulties of fusion when there are noisy modalities. The LSTM with Temporal Attention performs word level fusion at a finer fusion resolution between input modalities and attends to the most important time steps. As a result, the GME-LSTM(A) is able to better model the multimodal structure of speech through time and perform better sentiment comprehension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the publicly-available Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis (CMU-MOSI) dataset by achieving state-of-the-art sentiment classification and regression results. Qualitative analysis on our model emphasizes the importance of the Temporal Attention Layer in sentiment prediction because the additional acoustic and visual modalities are noisy. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the Gated Multimodal Embedding in selectively filtering these noisy modalities out. Our results and analysis open new areas in the study of sentiment analysis in human communication and provide new models for multimodal fusion.",0
"Abstract: In this work we present two different approaches for improving multimodal sentiment analysis by leveraging multiple sources of information from both visual and textual modalities, with particular emphasis on fusing these signals at the word level to improve performance. We focus on two specific approaches that can be used as standalone modules for fusion or reinforced learning methods such as deep Q-networks (DQN) that learn directly from raw image data. Our first approach utilizes convolutional neural network architectures pretrained on large scale datasets to extract features from images and video frames which capture high-level semantics that reflect relevant aspects of human emotional state recognition. To achieve effective integration across the varying sources of information we propose several alternative techniques including late fusion and attention mechanisms to selectively weight individual modalities based on their expected contribution. Furthermore, we provide extensive experimentation demonstrating that our method achieves strong results for a range of tasks related to the analysis of audio-visual expressions of emotion including valence and arousal estimation. Our second approach is concerned specifically with modeling interactions between individuals within social settings to obtain more fine-grained insights into collective sentiment that go beyond static single frame predictions. Here, we leverage deep learning architectures that have been designed to take advantage of temporal dependencies inherent within conversational interactions by processing sequences of adjacent frames to learn representations of interpersonal behavioral dynamics. Throughout the course of evaluation we demonstrate through a number of experiments across distinct publicly available benchmarks that our proposed technique yields competitive results that often outperform established alternatives. By combining our expertise in multimodal sentiment analysis wit",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods generally engage in exploratory behavior through noise injection in the action space. An alternative is to add noise directly to the agent's parameters, which can lead to more consistent exploration and a richer set of behaviors. Methods such as evolutionary strategies use parameter perturbations, but discard all temporal structure in the process and require significantly more samples. Combining parameter noise with traditional RL methods allows to combine the best of both worlds. We demonstrate that both off- and on-policy methods benefit from this approach through experimental comparison of DQN, DDPG, and TRPO on high-dimensional discrete action environments as well as continuous control tasks. Our results show that RL with parameter noise learns more efficiently than traditional RL with action space noise and evolutionary strategies individually.",0
"In recent years, computer vision has emerged as one of the most promising fields for artificial intelligence research and development. With the advancements in deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), significant progress has been made towards achieving human-level performance on tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc. However, these state-of-the-art models often require large amounts of data for training which can be expensive, time-consuming and might not always be available. In order to address this issue, a new technique known as parameter space noise was introduced that enables faster convergence without requiring more data. This method adds small perturbations to the model parameters during training which makes them robust to various types of disturbances, resulting in better generalization capabilities. By leveraging insights from psychology and neuroscience, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of how adding random noise to the model weights affects their behavior and improves exploration abilities leading to superior performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods across different datasets, architectures and hyperparameters settings confirming its efficacy. We believe that this novel approach holds great potential to revolutionize the field of Computer Vision by enabling developers to build powerful models even with limited resources while ensuring high accuracy rates.",1
"Localization is the problem of estimating the location of an autonomous agent from an observation and a map of the environment. Traditional methods of localization, which filter the belief based on the observations, are sub-optimal in the number of steps required, as they do not decide the actions taken by the agent. We propose ""Active Neural Localizer"", a fully differentiable neural network that learns to localize accurately and efficiently. The proposed model incorporates ideas of traditional filtering-based localization methods, by using a structured belief of the state with multiplicative interactions to propagate belief, and combines it with a policy model to localize accurately while minimizing the number of steps required for localization. Active Neural Localizer is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning. We use a variety of simulation environments for our experiments which include random 2D mazes, random mazes in the Doom game engine and a photo-realistic environment in the Unreal game engine. The results on the 2D environments show the effectiveness of the learned policy in an idealistic setting while results on the 3D environments demonstrate the model's capability of learning the policy and perceptual model jointly from raw-pixel based RGB observations. We also show that a model trained on random textures in the Doom environment generalizes well to a photo-realistic office space environment in the Unreal engine.",0
"In recent years, robotic localization has become increasingly important as robots have been deployed in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and service robots. Accurate localization is critical for these systems to navigate safely and efficiently through their environments. Traditional methods of localization rely on external sensors, like GPS, which can be unreliable in certain environments. Therefore, there is a need for new approaches that can accurately locate a robot without relying on external signals. This paper proposes a novel method called Active Neural Localization (ANL), which combines neural networks with active sensing to achieve accurate and robust localization. ANL uses deep learning algorithms to learn features from sensor data and estimate the robot's position using those features. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an active sensing mechanism to maximize the amount of relevant information gathered by the sensors. The proposed approach is tested extensively using simulations and experiments, showing significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward in the field of robotic localization and demonstrates the potential benefits of using neural networks combined with active sensing for achieving accurate localization.",1
"The dramatic success of deep neural networks across multiple application areas often relies on experts painstakingly designing a network architecture specific to each task. To simplify this process and make it more accessible, an emerging research effort seeks to automate the design of neural network architectures, using e.g. evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning or simple search in a constrained space of neural modules.   Considering the typical size of the search space (e.g. $10^{10}$ candidates for a $10$-layer network) and the cost of evaluating a single candidate, current architecture search methods are very restricted. They either rely on static pre-built modules to be recombined for the task at hand, or they define a static hand-crafted framework within which they can generate new architectures from the simplest possible operations.   In this paper, we relax these restrictions, by capitalizing on the collective wisdom contained in the plethora of neural networks published in online code repositories. Concretely, we (a) extract and publish GitGraph, a corpus of neural architectures and their descriptions; (b) we create problem-specific neural architecture search spaces, implemented as a textual search mechanism over GitGraph; (c) we propose a method of identifying unique common subgraphs within the architectures solving each problem (e.g., image processing, reinforcement learning), that can then serve as modules in the newly created problem specific neural search space.",0
"This can make it difficult to find and reuse code, as developers often have no idea if their problem has already been solved within another piece of software. One strategy that could potentially solve this issue is to automatically search a codebase and identify subgraphs (fragments of code) related to specific tasks or problems. These subgraphs could then be stored in a database and made easily accessible to future developers working on similar projects. Our proposed method is called “GitGraph”, which mines frequent computational subgraphs from large codebases using natural language processing techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and semantic role labeling. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying GitGraph to four real-world software systems: Android Java Code, Eclipse Plugins, IntelliJ IDEA plugins, and Python Libraries. We compare our results against other state-of-the-art approaches and show that GitGraph achieves better precision and recall than these methods while reducing runtime complexity significantly. Additionally, we perform qualitative analysis to illustrate how GitGraph can be used effectively for architecture recovery and program understanding purposes. Overall, our work contributes towards bridging the gap between automatic code synthesis and human-level understanding by enabling automated identification of frequently occurring code patterns relevant to specific programming tasks and use cases.",1
"Recent work in deep reinforcement learning has allowed algorithms to learn complex tasks such as Atari 2600 games just from the reward provided by the game, but these algorithms presently require millions of training steps in order to learn, making them approximately five orders of magnitude slower than humans. One reason for this is that humans build robust shared representations that are applicable to collections of problems, making it much easier to assimilate new variants. This paper first introduces the idea of automatically-generated game sets to aid in transfer learning research, and then demonstrates the utility of shared representations by showing that models can substantially benefit from the incorporation of relevant architectural priors. This technique affords a remarkable 50x positive transfer on a toy problem-set.",0
"Here’s one possible draft: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress on a wide range of problems, from games to control tasks. However, training these models often requires enormous amounts of data and computational resources. In situations where data collection is difficult or expensive, such as robotics experiments involving real-world interaction or large-scale simulations, reducing sample complexity becomes essential for feasible deployment. In other settings, such as online ad placements or fraud detection systems, low-data regimes may require efficient algorithms due to privacy constraints that limit the amount of interactions we can make. This paper proposes several novel methods designed to address sample efficiency challenges. We introduce a framework for transferring learned knowledge across environments, allowing new agents to leverage prior experience even if their initial state distribution differs substantially from previous ones. Our method uses regularized path consistency loss functions and modular architectures tailored to different agent components to ensure rapid adaptation while constraining overfitting. Extensive evaluation across a variety of continuous and discrete control domains demonstrates our approach leads to dramatic reductions in both sample consumption and wall clock time compared to state-of-the-art baselines, sometimes by orders of magnitude. These results show great promise for applying effective deep RL solutions to resource-constrained domains, enabling exciting future applications beyond current limitations.",1

"Statistical performance bounds for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be critical for high-stakes applications like healthcare. This paper introduces a new framework for theoretically measuring the performance of such algorithms called Uniform-PAC, which is a strengthening of the classical Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. In contrast to the PAC framework, the uniform version may be used to derive high probability regret guarantees and so forms a bridge between the two setups that has been missing in the literature. We demonstrate the benefits of the new framework for finite-state episodic MDPs with a new algorithm that is Uniform-PAC and simultaneously achieves optimal regret and PAC guarantees except for a factor of the horizon.",0
"In this paper we present new uniform regret bounds for episodic reinforcement learning algorithms that achieve provably correct behavior. We provide these bounds by providing tighter analyses for recent works on pseudo-regret and model error correction.

"Deep learning (DL) advances state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL), by incorporating deep neural networks in learning representations from the input to RL. However, the conventional deep neural network architecture is limited in learning representations for multi-task RL (MT-RL), as multiple tasks can refer to different kinds of representations. In this paper, we thus propose a novel deep neural network architecture, namely generalization tower network (GTN), which can achieve MT-RL within a single learned model. Specifically, the architecture of GTN is composed of both horizontal and vertical streams. In our GTN architecture, horizontal streams are used to learn representation shared in similar tasks. In contrast, the vertical streams are introduced to be more suitable for handling diverse tasks, which encodes hierarchical shared knowledge of these tasks. The effectiveness of the introduced vertical stream is validated by experimental results. Experimental results further verify that our GTN architecture is able to advance the state-of-the-art MT-RL, via being tested on 51 Atari games.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in numerous machine learning tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, training DNNs on multiple related tasks simultaneously has proven challenging due to their limited capacity to handle more than one task at a time. To address these limitations, we propose a new architecture called ""Generalization Tower Network"" (GTN), which allows DNNs to learn from multiple tasks concurrently by exploiting task relationships through shared convolutional kernels. GTN comprises two main components: generalization tower modules and multi-task fusion module, both designed to capture task correlations while enabling efficient computation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing architectures across various benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

With promising results, GTN paves the way for future research into developing novel network architectures capable of handling complex high-level cognitive functions required for humanlike intelligence.",1
"Multi-task learning (MTL) with neural networks leverages commonalities in tasks to improve performance, but often suffers from task interference which reduces the benefits of transfer. To address this issue we introduce the routing network paradigm, a novel neural network and training algorithm. A routing network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks. A function block may be any neural network - for example a fully-connected or a convolutional layer. Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function block to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively, terminating when a fixed recursion depth is reached. In this way the routing network dynamically composes different function blocks for each input. We employ a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to jointly train the router and function blocks. We evaluate our model against cross-stitch networks and shared-layer baselines on multi-task settings of the MNIST, mini-imagenet, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, with sharper convergence. In addition, routing networks have nearly constant per-task training cost while cross-stitch networks scale linearly with the number of tasks. On CIFAR-100 (20 tasks) we obtain cross-stitch performance levels with an 85% reduction in training time.",0
"Title: Adaptive selection of non-linear functions for multi-task learning  In many real world applications, multiple related tasks need to be performed simultaneously using limited computational resources. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) provides a framework where multiple tasks can share knowledge, leading to improved performance over traditional single task models. In MTL, each task has a unique loss function that needs to be minimized while sharing common weights across tasks. One popular approach to handle these diverse losses is by adaptively selecting the appropriate activation functions during training based on their gradient information. These activation functions serve as building blocks of neural networks and impact the expressiveness of the learned model significantly. Despite existing methods focusing primarily on linear activations like rectified linear unit (ReLU), polynomial activations have shown promising results due to their flexibility in fitting complex data distributions. However, they suffer from high computation cost and slow convergence rates compared to ReLUs since the Jacobian matrices have less sparsity and larger values. This work proposes two novel non-polynomial activation functions which inherit benefits of both linear and polynomial activations while mitigating their drawbacks. By utilizing these carefully crafted functions in combination with dynamic scheduling techniques, we present three new algorithms for addressing the task routing problem, which determines how often different subsets of tasks should be trained together rather than independently. Experimental evaluation shows improved accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the art competitors, establishing our method as a strong baseline for future research in multi-task learning.",1
"Stochastic composition optimization draws much attention recently and has been successful in many emerging applications of machine learning, statistical analysis, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we focus on the composition problem with nonsmooth regularization penalty. Previous works either have slow convergence rate or do not provide complete convergence analysis for the general problem. In this paper, we tackle these two issues by proposing a new stochastic composition optimization method for composition problem with nonsmooth regularization penalty. In our method, we apply variance reduction technique to accelerate the speed of convergence. To the best of our knowledge, our method admits the fastest convergence rate for stochastic composition optimization: for strongly convex composition problem, our algorithm is proved to admit linear convergence; for general composition problem, our algorithm significantly improves the state-of-the-art convergence rate from $O(T^{-1/2})$ to $O((n_1+n_2)^{{2}/{3}}T^{-1})$. Finally, we apply our proposed algorithm to portfolio management and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. Experimental results verify our theoretical analysis.",0

"Autoregressive generative models consistently achieve the best results in density estimation tasks involving high dimensional data, such as images or audio. They pose density estimation as a sequence modeling task, where a recurrent neural network (RNN) models the conditional distribution over the next element conditioned on all previous elements. In this paradigm, the bottleneck is the extent to which the RNN can model long-range dependencies, and the most successful approaches rely on causal convolutions, which offer better access to earlier parts of the sequence than conventional RNNs. Taking inspiration from recent work in meta reinforcement learning, where dealing with long-range dependencies is also essential, we introduce a new generative model architecture that combines causal convolutions with self attention. In this note, we describe the resulting model and present state-of-the-art log-likelihood results on CIFAR-10 (2.85 bits per dim) and $32 \times 32$ ImageNet (3.80 bits per dim).

"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using machine learning algorithms to generate realistic images from textual descriptions. One popular approach to achieving this task is through autoregressive modeling, where each pixel value in the image is generated one at a time based on the previously generated values. While existing methods have shown promising results, they often suffer from slow inference speeds and limited generation abilities due to their reliance on simple, hand-engineered features such as color palettes or predefined edge maps. This paper presents PixelSNAIL, a novel autoregressive generative model that overcomes these limitations by utilizing deep neural networks to directly predict each pixel value without relying on precomputed heuristics. By training our model on large datasets of natural images, we demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both speed and fidelity compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. We show that PixelSNAIL can generate high quality images comparable to those produced by human artists while maintaining fast inference times. Additionally, our model can handle complex scenes with multiple objects and varying light conditions, making it well suited for a variety of applications including computer vision, virtual reality, and art creation. Our contributions in this work serve as a foundation upon which future research in this area may build towards more advanced generative models capable of creating even more diverse, dynamic, and photorealistic images.",1
"Captioning models are typically trained using the cross-entropy loss. However, their performance is evaluated on other metrics designed to better correlate with human assessments. Recently, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can directly optimize these metrics in tasks such as captioning. However, this is computationally costly and requires specifying a baseline reward at each step to make training converge. We propose a fast approach to optimize one's objective of interest through the REINFORCE algorithm. First we show that, by replacing model samples with ground-truth sentences, RL training can be seen as a form of weighted cross-entropy loss, giving a fast, RL-based pre-training algorithm. Second, we propose to use the consensus among ground-truth captions of the same video as the baseline reward. This can be computed very efficiently. We call the complete proposal Consensus-based Sequence Training (CST). Applied to the MSRVTT video captioning benchmark, our proposals train significantly faster than comparable methods and establish a new state-of-the-art on the task, improving the CIDEr score from 47.3 to 54.2.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in video captioning tasks, which involve generating descriptive text summaries of videos. However, training these models can be challenging due to the lack of annotated data, especially for languages other than English. To address this issue, we propose a consensus-based sequence training (CST) approach that leverages multiple weak annotations from different sources to improve the quality of the generated captions. In our method, we first collect raw labels from non-expert users on crowdsourcing platforms, then apply statistical analysis to identify ambiguous frames and filter out low-quality labels. Next, we use majority voting to create a final set of high-confidence labels, which are used as ground truth during model training. We evaluate our proposed CST framework using several benchmark datasets across multiple languages and demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative experiments and user studies. Our results show that CST significantly improves caption accuracy compared to baseline methods while remaining efficient and scalable. This work represents an important step towards making high-quality video captioning accessible for diverse spoken language communities worldwide.",1
"Two main families of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and policy gradients, have recently been proven to be equivalent when using a softmax relaxation on one part, and an entropic regularization on the other. We relate this result to the well-known convex duality of Shannon entropy and the softmax function. Such a result is also known as the Donsker-Varadhan formula. This provides a short proof of the equivalence. We then interpret this duality further, and use ideas of convex analysis to prove a new policy inequality relative to soft Q-learning.",0
"Title: Variational Proofs and Learning Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence  Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in recent years due to advancements in machine learning algorithms, particularly those based on deep neural networks. These models have been trained using gradient descent methods that optimize objective functions related to accuracy measures such as loss minimization or cross entropy maximization. Policy gradient techniques were introduced as alternatives to these optimization methods, where iterative updates of policies are performed directly rather than by optimizing surrogate objectives. Soft-Q learning represents another variant of policy gradient methods which incorporates more flexibility during training compared to standard policy gradient approaches. In this work, we provide a short variational proof establishing the equivalence between policy gradients and soft-Q learning under specific conditions. This result provides new insights into the relationship between different types of learning algorithms used in modern AI systems and may lead to improved performance of these models through better understanding of their underlying principles. Further research can build upon our findings to develop more advanced AI systems capable of achieving even greater successes in complex tasks and applications beyond current capabilities.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully used to solve many continuous control tasks. Despite its impressive results however, fundamental questions regarding the sample complexity of RL on continuous problems remain open. We study the performance of RL in this setting by considering the behavior of the Least-Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD) estimator on the classic Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem from optimal control. We give the first finite-time analysis of the number of samples needed to estimate the value function for a fixed static state-feedback policy to within $\varepsilon$-relative error. In the process of deriving our result, we give a general characterization for when the minimum eigenvalue of the empirical covariance matrix formed along the sample path of a fast-mixing stochastic process concentrates above zero, extending a result by Koltchinskii and Mendelson in the independent covariates setting. Finally, we provide experimental evidence indicating that our analysis correctly captures the qualitative behavior of LSTD on several LQR instances.",0
"In recent years there has been renewed interest in developing reinforcement learning algorithms that scale well to large, high-dimensional state spaces. One such algorithm that has gained popularity is least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) learning. LSTD differs from other TD methods by using linear regression to approximate value functions and policy gradients, thus reducing computational complexity to O(d^2), where d is the size of the state space. This work examines the use of LSTD in solving continuous-time linear quadratic regulation problems. We show how LSTD can be applied to solve these types of problems under certain assumptions, including invertibility of system matrices and continuity of rewards/costs. Empirical results suggest that our proposed method converges faster than standard actor critic methods while exhibiting comparable performance in terms of solution quality. Our findings have implications for scaling reinforcement learning algorithms to larger, more complex domains.

"It is common to implicitly assume access to intelligently captured inputs (e.g., photos from a human photographer), yet autonomously capturing good observations is itself a major challenge. We address the problem of learning to look around: if a visual agent has the ability to voluntarily acquire new views to observe its environment, how can it learn efficient exploratory behaviors to acquire informative observations? We propose a reinforcement learning solution, where the agent is rewarded for actions that reduce its uncertainty about the unobserved portions of its environment. Based on this principle, we develop a recurrent neural network-based approach to perform active completion of panoramic natural scenes and 3D object shapes. Crucially, the learned policies are not tied to any recognition task nor to the particular semantic content seen during training. As a result, 1) the learned ""look around"" behavior is relevant even for new tasks in unseen environments, and 2) training data acquisition involves no manual labeling. Through tests in diverse settings, we demonstrate that our approach learns useful generic policies that transfer to new unseen tasks and environments.

This work breaks down these seemingly daunting problems into smaller tractable subproblems. To make real progress towards intelligent behavior the algorithms we develop must scale up to solve difficult yet feasible tasks. Our approach shows success at solving challenging tasks despite their difficulty and noise by making use of powerful hardware while also relying only upon basic algorithmic components which may ultimately lead us toward human level artificial intelligence.,1
"Humans are remarkably proficient at controlling their limbs and tools from a wide range of viewpoints and angles, even in the presence of optical distortions. In robotics, this ability is referred to as visual servoing: moving a tool or end-point to a desired location using primarily visual feedback. In this paper, we study how viewpoint-invariant visual servoing skills can be learned automatically in a robotic manipulation scenario. To this end, we train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine which actions move the end-point of a robotic arm to a desired object. The problem that must be solved by this controller is fundamentally ambiguous: under severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the actions in a single feedforward operation. Instead, our visual servoing system must use its memory of past movements to understand how the actions affect the robot motion from the current viewpoint, correcting mistakes and gradually moving closer to the target. This ability is in stark contrast to most visual servoing methods, which either assume known dynamics or require a calibration phase. We show how we can learn this recurrent controller using simulated data and a reinforcement learning objective. We then describe how the resulting model can be transferred to a real-world robot by disentangling perception from control and only adapting the visual layers. The adapted model can servo to previously unseen objects from novel viewpoints on a real-world Kuka IIWA robotic arm.

"An abstract for a paper titled ""Sim2Real View Invariant Visual Servoing by Recurrent Control"" would discuss the main goals and findings presented in the research study. Without access to the full text, I can only provide a general outline: The field of robotics has been focused on improving efficiency and effectiveness in performing tasks using machines. One critical component that needs attention is the alignment between simulation results and real-world performance. This paper presents a novel approach known as recurrent control which addresses the issue of view point variations across simulated environments, providing a solution that enhances translation from simulations to reality.  This research contributes towards enhancing existing techniques of visual servoing, where robots use camera feedback to achieve precise motions while executing tasks. By developing control policies based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained offline, the proposed method allows robots to adapt smoothly to changes in their environment, even when faced with dynamic obstacles or unexpected conditions. Furthermore, the RNN predictive capability enables efficient planning for optimal motion sequences, resulting in improved system stability and precision during execution.  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that recurrent control significantly outperforms traditional methods in several benchmark scenarios. Moreover, we showcase how our framework can handle challenges such as occlusions, illumination differences, or other factors that might disrupt perception. These promising results support the viability of our proposal as a breakthrough strategy in achieving robustness and reliability in robotic systems navigating complex environments. Overall, the paper provides significant insights into the potential benefits of incorporating learning principles in visual servoing and motivates future work on harnessing artificial intelligence for solving open problems at the intersection of computer vision and robotics.",1
"Recognizing multiple labels of images is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision, and remarkable progress has been attained by localizing semantic-aware image regions and predicting their labels with deep convolutional neural networks. The step of hypothesis regions (region proposals) localization in these existing multi-label image recognition pipelines, however, usually takes redundant computation cost, e.g., generating hundreds of meaningless proposals with non-discriminative information and extracting their features, and the spatial contextual dependency modeling among the localized regions are often ignored or over-simplified. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a recurrent attention reinforcement learning framework to iteratively discover a sequence of attentional and informative regions that are related to different semantic objects and further predict label scores conditioned on these regions. Besides, our method explicitly models long-term dependencies among these attentional regions that help to capture semantic label co-occurrence and thus facilitate multi-label recognition. Extensive experiments and comparisons on two large-scale benchmarks (i.e., PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO) show that our model achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency as well as explicitly identifying image-level semantic labels to specific object regions.",0
"Here's a possible abstract for your paper:  In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable successes in image recognition tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on feedforward neural networks that lack the ability to model temporal dynamics and spatial relationships in images. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to capture temporal dependencies effectively but often struggle with handling high-dimensional data like images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called Recurrent Attentional Reinforcement Learning (RARL), which combines RNNs with reinforcement learning and attentive mechanisms to perform multi-label image recognition.  Our method learns a policy that selects relevant regions from an input image and predicts labels based on these selected regions using an attention mechanism. We use REINFORCE, a popular algorithm for training policies in RNNs, to optimize our policy for maximum expected cumulative reward over multiple time steps. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets for multi-label image classification, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to baseline methods without any handcrafted features or preprocessing steps.  Our work highlights the potential benefits of integrating RNNs with attention and reinforcement learning for complex image recognition problems. Our code and models will be made publicly available to facilitate further research in this direction.",1
"Policy gradients methods often achieve better performance when the change in policy is limited to a small Kullback-Leibler divergence. We derive policy gradients where the change in policy is limited to a small Wasserstein distance (or trust region). This is done in the discrete and continuous multi-armed bandit settings with entropy regularisation. We show that in the small steps limit with respect to the Wasserstein distance $W_2$, policy dynamics are governed by the Fokker-Planck (heat) equation, following the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto result. This means that policies undergo diffusion and advection, concentrating near actions with high reward. This helps elucidate the nature of convergence in the probability matching setup, and provides justification for empirical practices such as Gaussian policy priors and additive gradient noise.",0
"Incorporate all four authors (Nahum Shimkin, Shaked Schkolne, Haggai M. Kfir and Shabtai D. Rekosh) Authors: Nahum Shimkin, Shaked Schkolne, Haggai M. Kfir and Shabtai D. Rekosh have recently conducted a study on the topic of reinforcement learning using the Wasserstein distance metric and how it relates to the Fokker-Planck equation. This paper seeks to explore the relationship between these two concepts, specifically looking at how the Wasserstein distance can provide insights into the behavior of systems that typically exhibit stochasticity in their dynamics. The main contribution of this paper lies in its application of the Wasserstein distance as a tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations such as the Fokker-Planck equation. By utilizing both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the authors demonstrate the potential advantages of using the Wasserstein distance over traditional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, they propose several new algorithms based on this framework that are capable of solving problems that were previously considered intractable. Overall, this research presents promising results in advancing our understanding of reinforcement learning methods and their applications in real-world scenarios, paving the way for further developments in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"Bayesian optimisation has been successfully applied to a variety of reinforcement learning problems. However, the traditional approach for learning optimal policies in simulators does not utilise the opportunity to improve learning by adjusting certain environment variables: state features that are unobservable and randomly determined by the environment in a physical setting but are controllable in a simulator. This paper considers the problem of finding a robust policy while taking into account the impact of environment variables. We present Alternating Optimisation and Quadrature (ALOQ), which uses Bayesian optimisation and Bayesian quadrature to address such settings. ALOQ is robust to the presence of significant rare events, which may not be observable under random sampling, but play a substantial role in determining the optimal policy. Experimental results across different domains show that ALOQ can learn more efficiently and robustly than existing methods.",0
"In order to ensure that our control algorithms are robust and reliable we need to take into account both their stability properties and performance metrics. While classical methods relying on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) have proven to be effective for controller synthesis, they can suffer from conservatism issues which leads to suboptimal solutions. This work focuses on developing novel computational tools based on Alternating Direction Methods Of Multipliers (ADMM) and Quadrature Rule optimization approaches designed to solve problems related to system stabilization and optimal control subject to Uncertainty Described by Polytopal Sets (UDPs). Our proposed approach combines LMI techniques together with ADMM solvers and quadrature rule optimization methods to find less conservative controllers while guaranteeing stability. Simulation results indicate significant improvement over current state-of-the art methods making it particularly suitable for real-time implementation on embedded platforms where limited computing power might constrain the adoption of complex algorithmic schemes. The generality afforded by our methodology offers new perspectives beyond the scope of linear systems allowing researchers to envision future applications towards nonlinear uncertain systems as well as hybrid ones incorporating discrete events.",1
"While bigger and deeper neural network architectures continue to advance the state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks, real-world adoption of these networks is impeded by hardware and speed constraints. Conventional model compression methods attempt to address this problem by modifying the architecture manually or using pre-defined heuristics. Since the space of all reduced architectures is very large, modifying the architecture of a deep neural network in this way is a difficult task. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a principled method for learning reduced network architectures in a data-driven way using reinforcement learning. Our approach takes a larger `teacher' network as input and outputs a compressed `student' network derived from the `teacher' network. In the first stage of our method, a recurrent policy network aggressively removes layers from the large `teacher' model. In the second stage, another recurrent policy network carefully reduces the size of each remaining layer. The resulting network is then evaluated to obtain a reward -- a score based on the accuracy and compression of the network. Our approach uses this reward signal with policy gradients to train the policies to find a locally optimal student network. Our experiments show that we can achieve compression rates of more than 10x for models such as ResNet-34 while maintaining similar performance to the input `teacher' network. We also present a valuable transfer learning result which shows that policies which are pre-trained on smaller `teacher' networks can be used to rapidly speed up training on larger `teacher' networks.",0
"Neural networks have become increasingly popular as models for deep learning applications due to their ability to capture complex relationships within data sets. However, these models often require large amounts of computational resources and can become computationally intractable for larger datasets. One approach to addressing this issue is through network compression techniques that aim to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we propose using policy gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL) as a means of compressing neural network models from one architecture into another without losing significant performance. Our method consists of training a meta-agent on a surrogate task that optimizes the parameters of a ""compressor"" agent that maps outputs from one neural network onto the parameters of another. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets across different domains and demonstrate improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our results suggest that PGRL has great potential for use as a general tool for accelerating machine learning pipelines by enabling efficient model deployment and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, our findings may pave the way for better understanding of how humans learn and adapt to new tasks over time. Future directions include examining the generality of our proposed methodology on a wide range of problem types such as natural language processing and computer vision tasks, expanding the set of environments used in testing, evaluating the impact of different reward functions on the trained agents' behavior, and applying our learned policies directly to novel tasks without fine-tuning any of their components, which should allow them to exhibit more human like behavior than current models built solely on statistical inference only. Finally, future research might examine the possibility of extending our framework to integrate biological knowledge either by incorporat",1
"Machine learning models are powerful but fallible. Generating adversarial examples - inputs deliberately crafted to cause model misclassification or other errors - can yield important insight into model assumptions and vulnerabilities. Despite significant recent work on adversarial example generation targeting image classifiers, relatively little work exists exploring adversarial example generation for text classifiers; additionally, many existing adversarial example generation algorithms require full access to target model parameters, rendering them impractical for many real-world attacks. In this work, we introduce DANCin SEQ2SEQ, a GAN-inspired algorithm for adversarial text example generation targeting largely black-box text classifiers. We recast adversarial text example generation as a reinforcement learning problem, and demonstrate that our algorithm offers preliminary but promising steps towards generating semantically meaningful adversarial text examples in a real-world attack scenario.",0
"In the era of deep learning, generative models have made significant progress towards generating realistic images (e.g., BigGAN, StableDiffusion), audio (e.g., WaveGrad, MelNet), and even human-like speech (e.g., TTS). These advancements have been fueled by the rapid development of powerful neural network architectures, increased computational resources, and innovations such as adversarial training objectives like those from GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Despite these gains, however, natural language generation remains challenging. Even state-of-the-art text-generating systems struggle to produce coherent passages without relying on pretraining data and suffer from several drawbacks. Motivated by the successes achieved within image synthesis, we aim to improve the quality of generated text using adversarial examples that expose weaknesses in current text classification models and correspondingly lead to better textual representations learned during generator training through minmax adversarial example generation. We develop two specific attacks based upon text corruption/adversarial perturbation methods from previous work in NLP but train them end-to-end alongside our main generators instead of independently in posthoc fashion; our generators thereby learn to generate adversarial examples concurrently while still optimizing their reconstruction loss functions. Through experiments evaluating both quantitatively via metrics like BLEU score, ROUGE, etc. and qualitatively, including human evaluation, across multiple datasets we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach at improving overall system performance over baselines from prior art despite being trained under weaker assumptions than alternative approaches that explicitly rely on access to paired training data.

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown incredible performance in learning various tasks to the human level. However, unlike human perception, current DRL models connect the entire low-level sensory input to the state-action values rather than exploiting the relationship between and among entities that constitute the sensory input. Because of this difference, DRL needs vast amount of experience samples to learn. In this paper, we propose a Multi-focus Attention Network (MANet) which mimics human ability to spatially abstract the low-level sensory input into multiple entities and attend to them simultaneously. The proposed method first divides the low-level input into several segments which we refer to as partial states. After this segmentation, parallel attention layers attend to the partial states relevant to solving the task. Our model estimates state-action values using these attended partial states. In our experiments, MANet attains highest scores with significantly less experience samples. Additionally, the model shows higher performance compared to the Deep Q-network and the single attention model as benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend our model to attentive communication model for performing multi-agent cooperative tasks. In multi-agent cooperative task experiments, our model shows 20% faster learning than existing state-of-the-art model.",0
"One of the fundamental challenges facing modern deep reinforcement learning algorithms is the efficiency with which they explore new environments and learn from their interactions. In many cases, these algorithms rely on heuristics that may be suboptimal or even incorrect, leading to wasted time and resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-focus attention network architecture designed specifically for efficient and effective exploration of complex problems spaces. Our approach utilizes a combination of global context and local attention mechanisms to focus simultaneously on multiple relevant aspects of the environment while learning to make informed decisions about actions. We evaluate our method using several benchmarking tasks across different domains and demonstrate consistent improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed multi-focus attention network provides a promising direction towards achieving more efficient and effective deep reinforcement learning.",1
"This paper aims at theoretically and empirically comparing two standard optimization criteria for Reinforcement Learning: i) maximization of the mean value and ii) minimization of the Bellman residual. For that purpose, we place ourselves in the framework of policy search algorithms, that are usually designed to maximize the mean value, and derive a method that minimizes the residual $\|T_* v_\pi - v_\pi\|_{1,\nu}$ over policies. A theoretical analysis shows how good this proxy is to policy optimization, and notably that it is better than its value-based counterpart. We also propose experiments on randomly generated generic Markov decision processes, specifically designed for studying the influence of the involved concentrability coefficient. They show that the Bellman residual is generally a bad proxy to policy optimization and that directly maximizing the mean value is much better, despite the current lack of deep theoretical analysis. This might seem obvious, as directly addressing the problem of interest is usually better, but given the prevalence of (projected) Bellman residual minimization in value-based reinforcement learning, we believe that this question is worth to be considered.",0
"This paper examines the use of the Bellman residual as a proxy for suboptimal solutions in certain classes of dynamic programming problems. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that challenges the effectiveness of the Bellman residual as a reliable measure of optimality gap, particularly in cases where the problem exhibits curvature effects. Our analysis shows that in such situations, the Bellman residual can significantly overestimate the actual suboptimality of the solution, leading to inaccurate estimates of convergence rates and potential wrong inference regarding algorithm performance. Our findings have important implications for the design and analysis of algorithms based on the Bellman residual heuristics, highlighting the need for more rigorous approaches to evaluate their quality. The results presented here contribute new insights into the understanding of optimality gaps in dynamic programming, shedding light on a classic but still widely used technique.",1
"A core aspect of human intelligence is the ability to learn new tasks quickly and switch between them flexibly. Here, we describe a modular continual reinforcement learning paradigm inspired by these abilities. We first introduce a visual interaction environment that allows many types of tasks to be unified in a single framework. We then describe a reward map prediction scheme that learns new tasks robustly in the very large state and action spaces required by such an environment. We investigate how properties of module architecture influence efficiency of task learning, showing that a module motif incorporating specific design principles (e.g. early bottlenecks, low-order polynomial nonlinearities, and symmetry) significantly outperforms more standard neural network motifs, needing fewer training examples and fewer neurons to achieve high levels of performance. Finally, we present a meta-controller architecture for task switching based on a dynamic neural voting scheme, which allows new modules to use information learned from previously-seen tasks to substantially improve their own learning efficiency.",0

Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposed techniques can significantly outperform standard RL algorithms, sometimes even achieving higher performance than human experts. Finally, we provide analysis showing how each component contributes to overall improvements, as well as ablation studies to investigate their design choices.",1

In response to this need, we present MINOS (Multimodal INdoor ONstruct), a modular simulation platform designed to train autonomous agents in navigating complex indoor spaces filled with unpredictability, clutter, dynamic obstacles, and human interactions. Compared to existing indoor navigation simulators like Habitat and AirSim, MINOS goes further by providing a more comprehensive set of sensor inputs, including LiDAR point clouds, RGB images, depth maps, optical flow, odometry, IMU data, and semantic segmentation masks. Additionally, MINOS allows users to fine-tune simulation parameters and scenarios, enabling experiments exploring sensory degradations, environmental variabilities, and robot capabilities.

"This paper proposes adversarial attacks for Reinforcement Learning (RL) and then improves the robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (DRL) to parameter uncertainties with the help of these attacks. We show that even a naively engineered attack successfully degrades the performance of DRL algorithm. We further improve the attack using gradient information of an engineered loss function which leads to further degradation in performance. These attacks are then leveraged during training to improve the robustness of RL within robust control framework.

"We develop a parameterized Primal-Dual $\pi$ Learning method based on deep neural networks for Markov decision process with large state space and off-policy reinforcement learning. In contrast to the popular Q-learning and actor-critic methods that are based on successive approximations to the nonlinear Bellman equation, our method makes primal-dual updates to the policy and value functions utilizing the fundamental linear Bellman duality. Naive parametrization of the primal-dual $\pi$ learning method using deep neural networks would encounter two major challenges: (1) each update requires computing a probability distribution over the state space and is intractable; (2) the iterates are unstable since the parameterized Lagrangian function is no longer linear. We address these challenges by proposing a relaxed Lagrangian formulation with a regularization penalty using the advantage function. We show that the dual policy update step in our method is equivalent to the policy gradient update in the actor-critic method in some special case, while the value updates differ substantially. The main advantage of the primal-dual $\pi$ learning method lies in that the value and policy updates are closely coupled together using the Bellman duality and therefore more informative. Experiments on a simple cart-pole problem show that the algorithm significantly outperforms the one-step temporal-difference actor-critic method, which is the most relevant benchmark method to compare with. We believe that the primal-dual updates to the value and policy functions would expedite the learning process. The proposed methods might open a door to more efficient algorithms and sharper theoretical analysis.",0

We show how the resulting actor-critic system can learn faster and more accurately than existing methods through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark games. Our approach has applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and other domains where learning optimal policies is essential.",1
"Glycemic control is essential for critical care. However, it is a challenging task because there has been no study on personalized optimal strategies for glycemic control. This work aims to learn personalized optimal glycemic trajectories for severely ill septic patients by learning data-driven policies to identify optimal targeted blood glucose levels as a reference for clinicians. We encoded patient states using a sparse autoencoder and adopted a reinforcement learning paradigm using policy iteration to learn the optimal policy from data. We also estimated the expected return following the policy learned from the recorded glycemic trajectories, which yielded a function indicating the relationship between real blood glucose values and 90-day mortality rates. This suggests that the learned optimal policy could reduce the patients' estimated 90-day mortality rate by 6.3%, from 31% to 24.7%. The result demonstrates that reinforcement learning with appropriate patient state encoding can potentially provide optimal glycemic trajectories and allow clinicians to design a personalized strategy for glycemic control in septic patients.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to personalized glycemic control for septic patients using representation learning techniques and reinforcement learning methods.

These representations allow us to extract meaningful features that capture important variations among patients that can be used to inform treatment decisions. Furthermore, our approach employs model-free reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize insulin dosing regimens based on real-time feedback from patient responses. This enables adaptive policy updates and fine-tuning over time to achieve superior glycemic outcomes without excessive hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Through extensive simulation studies and evaluations on large datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework compared to existing methods.

"Predictable Feature Analysis (PFA) (Richthofer, Wiskott, ICMLA 2015) is an algorithm that performs dimensionality reduction on high dimensional input signal. It extracts those subsignals that are most predictable according to a certain prediction model. We refer to these extracted signals as predictable features.   In this work we extend the notion of PFA to take supplementary information into account for improving its predictions. Such information can be a multidimensional signal like the main input to PFA, but is regarded external. That means it won't participate in the feature extraction - no features get extracted or composed of it. Features will be exclusively extracted from the main input such that they are most predictable based on themselves and the supplementary information. We refer to this enhanced PFA as PFAx (PFA extended).   Even more important than improving prediction quality is to observe the effect of supplementary information on feature selection. PFAx transparently provides insight how the supplementary information adds to prediction quality and whether it is valuable at all. Finally we show how to invert that relation and can generate the supplementary information such that it would yield a certain desired outcome of the main signal.   We apply this to a setting inspired by reinforcement learning and let the algorithm learn how to control an agent in an environment. With this method it is feasible to locally optimize the agent's state, i.e. reach a certain goal that is near enough. We are preparing a follow-up paper that extends this method such that also global optimization is feasible.",0

"Model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to be capable of learning a wide range of robotic skills, but typically require a very large number of samples to achieve good performance. Model-based algorithms, in principle, can provide for much more efficient learning, but have proven difficult to extend to expressive, high-capacity models such as deep neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that medium-sized neural network models can in fact be combined with model predictive control (MPC) to achieve excellent sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, producing stable and plausible gaits to accomplish various complex locomotion tasks. We also propose using deep neural network dynamics models to initialize a model-free learner, in order to combine the sample efficiency of model-based approaches with the high task-specific performance of model-free methods. We empirically demonstrate on MuJoCo locomotion tasks that our pure model-based approach trained on just random action data can follow arbitrary trajectories with excellent sample efficiency, and that our hybrid algorithm can accelerate model-free learning on high-speed benchmark tasks, achieving sample efficiency gains of 3-5x on swimmer, cheetah, hopper, and ant agents.

We first train a feedforward neural network as a generative model by minimizing reconstruction error on input data collected from expert demonstrations. Then, we fine-tune the weights of this network using real-time policy gradient updates based on new interactions with the environment. Our approach combines the strengths of model-free DRL methods, which can learn more quickly but suffer from instability, and model-based DRL methods, which can learn faster and generalize better but require explicit models of the environment dynamics. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmark results across three diverse control tasks: simulated robot manipulation, locomotion control of a hexapod robot, and video game playing. These findings showcase the effectiveness of our novel combination of model-based RL with online model adaptation via real-time fine-tuning.",1
"We present a new AI task -- Embodied Question Answering (EmbodiedQA) -- where an agent is spawned at a random location in a 3D environment and asked a question (""What color is the car?""). In order to answer, the agent must first intelligently navigate to explore the environment, gather information through first-person (egocentric) vision, and then answer the question (""orange"").   This challenging task requires a range of AI skills -- active perception, language understanding, goal-driven navigation, commonsense reasoning, and grounding of language into actions. In this work, we develop the environments, end-to-end-trained reinforcement learning agents, and evaluation protocols for EmbodiedQA.",0
"Embodied Question Answering (QA) systems have emerged as powerful tools that can provide accurate answers to natural language queries by leveraging external knowledge sources such as webpages, documents, and databases. These systems use machine learning algorithms to encode relationships among concepts within these sources and map them to user questions, allowing them to generate concise and relevant responses in real time. However, traditional QA methods suffer from several limitations: they are often limited to specific domains or require manual engineering efforts to adapt to new tasks. Furthermore, their ability to handle uncertainty and ambiguity is limited, leading to errors and irrelevant results. To overcome these challenges, we propose an embodied approach to question answering where we combine the power of symbolic reasoning and deep learning techniques with physical interaction. This allows us to perform better context understanding and handling more complex tasks without relying on static external resources or explicit supervision. Our system consists of three main components: a conversational interface, an integrated environment simulator, and a hybrid architecture combining neural networks with logical rules. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments showing significant improvements over baseline models and state-of-the art approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our work demonstrates the potential of incorporating embodiment into QA systems to enable more robust and flexible performance across different scenarios and applications.",1
"Learning to Optimize is a recently proposed framework for learning optimization algorithms using reinforcement learning. In this paper, we explore learning an optimization algorithm for training shallow neural nets. Such high-dimensional stochastic optimization problems present interesting challenges for existing reinforcement learning algorithms. We develop an extension that is suited to learning optimization algorithms in this setting and demonstrate that the learned optimization algorithm consistently outperforms other known optimization algorithms even on unseen tasks and is robust to changes in stochasticity of gradients and the neural net architecture. More specifically, we show that an optimization algorithm trained with the proposed method on the problem of training a neural net on MNIST generalizes to the problems of training neural nets on the Toronto Faces Dataset, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to optimizing neural networks that significantly improves their performance on a variety of tasks. Our method builds upon recent advances in machine learning by leveraging techniques from deep reinforcement learning. In particular, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn a policy that directly optimizes the parameters of the neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimization methods. Furthermore, our approach is general and can be applied to a wide range of neural network architectures. Overall, these results highlight the potential of using deep reinforcement learning to optimize neural networks.",1
"In statistical dialogue management, the dialogue manager learns a policy that maps a belief state to an action for the system to perform. Efficient exploration is key to successful policy optimisation. Current deep reinforcement learning methods are very promising but rely on epsilon-greedy exploration, thus subjecting the user to a random choice of action during learning. Alternative approaches such as Gaussian Process SARSA (GPSARSA) estimate uncertainties and are sample efficient, leading to better user experience, but on the expense of a greater computational complexity. This paper examines approaches to extract uncertainty estimates from deep Q-networks (DQN) in the context of dialogue management. We perform an extensive benchmark of deep Bayesian methods to extract uncertainty estimates, namely Bayes-By-Backprop, dropout, its concrete variation, bootstrapped ensemble and alpha-divergences, combining it with DQN algorithm.",0
"This paper proposes a method for efficiently optimizing neural network-based dialogue policies by incorporating uncertainty estimates into the optimization process. Traditional methods for optimizing dialogue policies use hand-engineered features and heuristics which can often lead to suboptimal results. By leveraging recent advances in Bayesian deep learning, we can learn robust policy models that capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We propose two variants of our algorithm: one based on Monte Carlo dropout sampling and another using ensembling multiple independently trained models. Both approaches demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines across several benchmark datasets. Our work paves the way towards more reliable and adaptive conversational agents that can handle real-world scenarios.",1
"Learning an optimal policy from a multi-modal reward function is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical RL (HRL) tackles this problem by learning a hierarchical policy, where multiple option policies are in charge of different strategies corresponding to modes of a reward function and a gating policy selects the best option for a given context. Although HRL has been demonstrated to be promising, current state-of-the-art methods cannot still perform well in complex real-world problems due to the difficulty of identifying modes of the reward function. In this paper, we propose a novel method called hierarchical policy search via return-weighted density estimation (HPSDE), which can efficiently identify the modes through density estimation with return-weighted importance sampling. Our proposed method finds option policies corresponding to the modes of the return function and automatically determines the number and the location of option policies, which significantly reduces the burden of hyper-parameters tuning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed HPSDE successfully learns option policies corresponding to modes of the return function and that it can be successfully applied to a challenging motion planning problem of a redundant robotic manipulator.",0
"This abstract describes how hierarchical policy search using return-weighted density estimation can improve exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning. By breaking down tasks into smaller subtasks and estimating their densities based on returns achieved by different policies, we can achieve more efficient search and better performance overall. The authors evaluate their approach through simulations and real-world robotics experiments, demonstrating that hierarchical policy search with RWDE leads to significant improvements over traditional approaches. Ultimately, these findings have important implications for the design of effective policies in complex decision making under uncertainty problems, highlighting the potential of hierarchy as a powerful tool in artificial intelligence research.",1
"We view intersection handling on autonomous vehicles as a reinforcement learning problem, and study its behavior in a transfer learning setting. We show that a network trained on one type of intersection generally is not able to generalize to other intersections. However, a network that is pre-trained on one intersection and fine-tuned on another performs better on the new task compared to training in isolation. This network also retains knowledge of the prior task, even though some forgetting occurs. Finally, we show that the benefits of fine-tuning hold when transferring simulated intersection handling knowledge to a real autonomous vehicle.",0
"In today’s world, self driving cars have become more popular due to their safety features. However, they still require fine tuning before becoming fully autonomous vehicles. One important aspect of improving these vehicles is ensuring that they can navigate intersections safely. This work focuses on investigating how knowledge acquired from simulation can be transferred onto real road scenarios so that autonomous vehicles can better respond to changing traffic conditions, obstacles, and unexpected events such as pedestrians crossing the street mid-way through a green light cycle. A critical component of this research involves developing algorithms that enable transfer learning across domains by utilizing deep neural networks trained on large amounts of simulated data combined with smaller datasets collected from real intersection video footage. Another key aspect of this work includes conducting extensive experiments to evaluate the performance gains achieved using domain adaptation techniques. Overall, the findings provide new insights into advancing state-of-the art methods that bridge the gap between simulations and reality. By closing this divide, we improve the ability of self-driving cars to recognize complex situations involving human behavior and other difficult road phenomena leading to safer roads for everyone involved.

"Safely exploring an unknown dynamical system is critical to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) in physical systems where failures may have catastrophic consequences. In scenarios where one knows little about the dynamics, diverse transition data covering relevant regions of state-action space is needed to apply either model-based or model-free RL. Motivated by the cooling of Google's data centers, we study how one can safely identify the parameters of a system model with a desired accuracy and confidence level. In particular, we focus on learning an unknown linear system with Gaussian noise assuming only that, initially, a nominal safe action is known. Define safety as satisfying specific linear constraints on the state space (e.g., requirements on process variable) that must hold over the span of an entire trajectory, and given a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) style bound on the estimation error of model parameters, we show how to compute safe regions of action space by gradually growing a ball around the nominal safe action. One can apply any exploration strategy where actions are chosen from such safe regions. Experiments on a stylized model of data center cooling dynamics show how computing proper safe regions can increase the sample efficiency of safe exploration.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to identifying linear systems from noisy input data using robust optimization techniques. We propose a method that combines sensitivity analysis and iterative parameter refinement to selectively generate informative perturbations and improve the accuracy of system identification. Our framework allows us to handle noise and uncertainties present in real-world data, resulting in more reliable estimates of the underlying models. Through extensive simulations and experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, this work provides a powerful tool for safe exploration of complex linear systems under uncertainty, paving the way for improved control and prediction in many applications ranging from engineering to finance.",1
"This paper studies directed exploration for reinforcement learning agents by tracking uncertainty about the value of each available action. We identify two sources of uncertainty that are relevant for exploration. The first originates from limited data (parametric uncertainty), while the second originates from the distribution of the returns (return uncertainty). We identify methods to learn these distributions with deep neural networks, where we estimate parametric uncertainty with Bayesian drop-out, while return uncertainty is propagated through the Bellman equation as a Gaussian distribution. Then, we identify that both can be jointly estimated in one network, which we call the Double Uncertain Value Network. The policy is directly derived from the learned distributions based on Thompson sampling. Experimental results show that both types of uncertainty may vastly improve learning in domains with a strong exploration challenge.",0
"Double Uncertain Value Networks (DUVN) is a promising new technique for efficient exploration of complex systems by leveraging uncertainties present in data distributions. This approach addresses the computational challenge of modeling real-world problems by approximating them into tractable mathematical expressions while retaining important information from the original problem. DUVN offers significant advantages over traditional simulation methods as it allows us to quickly explore multiple scenarios and identify more solutions at significantly reduced computation costs. Moreover, DUVN has been demonstrated to outperform existing state-of-the art methods in terms of accuracy, speed, scalability, adaptability, and interpretability on a range of challenging problems across different domains including finance, healthcare, robotics, and environmental science. In conclusion, we believe that DUVN represents a powerful toolset for solving complex problems under uncertainty in real-time decision making environments and paves the way towards enabling more informed decisions across diverse applications.",1
"We investigate the integration of a planning mechanism into sequence-to-sequence models using attention. We develop a model which can plan ahead in the future when it computes its alignments between input and output sequences, constructing a matrix of proposed future alignments and a commitment vector that governs whether to follow or recompute the plan. This mechanism is inspired by the recently proposed strategic attentive reader and writer (STRAW) model for Reinforcement Learning. Our proposed model is end-to-end trainable using primarily differentiable operations. We show that it outperforms a strong baseline on character-level translation tasks from WMT'15, the algorithmic task of finding Eulerian circuits of graphs, and question generation from the text. Our analysis demonstrates that the model computes qualitatively intuitive alignments, converges faster than the baselines, and achieves superior performance with fewer parameters.",0
"This research paper proposes a novel approach to improve performance on sequence-to-sequence models by incorporating planning into the model architecture. The proposed method consists of three main components: planning, attention, and generation. The planning component generates context representations that summarize the input sequence and guide the attention mechanism during decoding. The attention mechanism then weights these contexts to generate target outputs that better match the desired output sequence. Experiments on various tasks show significant improvements over traditional sequence-to-sequence models, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating planning into the model design process.",1
"We present a suite of reinforcement learning environments illustrating various safety properties of intelligent agents. These problems include safe interruptibility, avoiding side effects, absent supervisor, reward gaming, safe exploration, as well as robustness to self-modification, distributional shift, and adversaries. To measure compliance with the intended safe behavior, we equip each environment with a performance function that is hidden from the agent. This allows us to categorize AI safety problems into robustness and specification problems, depending on whether the performance function corresponds to the observed reward function. We evaluate A2C and Rainbow, two recent deep reinforcement learning agents, on our environments and show that they are not able to solve them satisfactorily.",0
"In this paper we present our design methodology for developing safe artificial intelligence systems using grid world safety testing frameworks. Our approach consists of three main stages: system specification, training data generation and safety testing. During the first stage, we define the high level goals and constraints for the AI agent, as well as specify the environment and reward function. This helps us create meaningful objectives that align with human values and ethical principles, such as robustness against adversarial attacks or preserving human life at all costs. Next, we generate large amounts of diverse training data from simulations of the AI’s interactions within different versions of the grid world environment, ensuring that it can adapt effectively to new situations during deployment. Finally, we conduct rigorous safety tests on the trained AI agent, evaluating its behavior in terms of adherence to ethical guidelines, risk mitigation strategies, impact assessment measures, and other relevant criteria. By integrating these elements into one cohesive framework, we aim to provide assurances of safety and trustworthiness for advanced AI applications deployed in critical domains where negative consequences could be severe or irreversible. We argue that such methods must become commonplace if society wishes to reap the full benefits of intelligent automation while minimizing potential risks. This work contributes to the broader conversation surrounding responsible innovation practices in machine learning and related fields, encouraging further research towards safe, explainable, fair and transparent models moving forward.",1
"Neural networks dominate the modern machine learning landscape, but their training and success still suffer from sensitivity to empirical choices of hyperparameters such as model architecture, loss function, and optimisation algorithm. In this work we present \emph{Population Based Training (PBT)}, a simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which results in stable training and better final performance.",0
"Neural networks can learn to recognize patterns from large amounts of data. They have been used for image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, control systems, robotics, predictive analytics, genetic algorithms, expert systems and many other applications. This research proposes that neural network training benefit from population based methods: methods inspired by biological evolution such as evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence and self organization. These approaches have recently shown promising results for learning problems with noise and incomplete information. We describe how different components of these methods can be adapted to train neural networks: evolving populations of weights, using selection pressures on the weights, rewarding behaviors of individual agents, using multi-agent cooperation. We review several case studies illustrating their efficacy in improving both accuracy and speed of training: backpropagation, deep belief nets (DBN), convolutional nets and recurrent nets (LSTM). Our work contributes to the field of machine learning providing new insights and methodologies applicable to most neural models. We hope our findings will inspire further investigation into hybrid model techniques combining strengths of machine learning paradigms. Keywords: neural networks, population based optimization, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, self organization.",1
"One of the main challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is generalisation. In typical deep RL methods this is achieved by approximating the optimal value function with a low-dimensional representation using a deep network. While this approach works well in many domains, in domains where the optimal value function cannot easily be reduced to a low-dimensional representation, learning can be very slow and unstable. This paper contributes towards tackling such challenging domains, by proposing a new method, called Hybrid Reward Architecture (HRA). HRA takes as input a decomposed reward function and learns a separate value function for each component reward function. Because each component typically only depends on a subset of all features, the corresponding value function can be approximated more easily by a low-dimensional representation, enabling more effective learning. We demonstrate HRA on a toy-problem and the Atari game Ms. Pac-Man, where HRA achieves above-human performance.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising artificial intelligence technologies, capable of achieving superhuman performance across multiple domains, ranging from games to robotics. However, despite these successes, designing efficient reward functions remains a challenging task in DRL research due to their impact on the behavior and performance of agents trained under them. In particular, finding appropriate intrinsic rewards that reflect meaningful progress towards goals while avoiding spurious correlations is crucial but difficult. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel hybrid reward architecture based on the combination of extrinsic rewards provided by humans with intrinsic motivators learned during training, enabling transfer from well-defined goal sets to complex high-dimensional tasks. We demonstrate through extensive experimental evaluations across diverse environments and algorithms that our approach yields better overall results than baseline methods. These findings contribute new insights into how to effectively combine external knowledge with internal drives in large-scale AI systems, ultimately leading to more robust and adaptive behaviors. By providing a principled methodology for building intelligent agents with balanced reward signals, this work paves the way for future advances in autonomous decision making grounded in both human expertise and agent self-motivation.",1
"Generating natural language descriptions of images is an important capability for a robot or other visual-intelligence driven AI agent that may need to communicate with human users about what it is seeing. Such image captioning methods are typically trained by maximising the likelihood of ground-truth annotated caption given the image. While simple and easy to implement, this approach does not directly maximise the language quality metrics we care about such as CIDEr. In this paper we investigate training image captioning methods based on actor-critic reinforcement learning in order to directly optimise non-differentiable quality metrics of interest. By formulating a per-token advantage and value computation strategy in this novel reinforcement learning based captioning model, we show that it is possible to achieve the state of the art performance on the widely used MSCOCO benchmark.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to image captioning using actor-critic sequence training (ACT). We propose that the standard maximum likelihood training used in many existing models can suffer from shortcomings related to optimization difficulties and exposure bias. To address these issues, we develop a novel framework that combines the advantages of both policy gradient methods and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. Our method uses a deterministic policy gradient algorithm as the actor, which directly learns a mapping from inputs to text descriptions. At each iteration, the algorithm updates its parameters by following the natural gradient path to optimize a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of the data. As a critic, our method employs an online estimator of the state value function based on Monte Carlo rollouts, providing valuable feedback to guide the search direction taken by the actor. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our proposed approach for generating descriptive and accurate captions. Overall, this work represents an important step towards developing more efficient and scalable solutions for automatic image description tasks.",1
"We build a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that can predict the likelihood of an individual testing positive for malaria by asking questions about their household. The RL agent learns to determine which survey question to ask next and when to stop to make a prediction about their likelihood of malaria based on their responses hitherto. The agent incurs a small penalty for each question asked, and a large reward/penalty for making the correct/wrong prediction; it thus has to learn to balance the length of the survey with the accuracy of its final predictions. Our RL agent is a Deep Q-network that learns a policy directly from the responses to the questions, with an action defined for each possible survey question and for each possible prediction class. We focus on Kenya, where malaria is a massive health burden, and train the RL agent on a dataset of 6481 households from the Kenya Malaria Indicator Survey 2015. To investigate the importance of having survey questions be adaptive to responses, we compare our RL agent to a supervised learning (SL) baseline that fixes its set of survey questions a priori. We evaluate on prediction accuracy and on the number of survey questions asked on a holdout set and find that the RL agent is able to predict with 80% accuracy, using only 2.5 questions on average. In addition, the RL agent learns to survey adaptively to responses and is able to match the SL baseline in prediction accuracy while significantly reducing survey length.",0
"In addition to traditional approaches like weather forecasting, surveillance programs have been used extensively by public health organizations as part of their malaria control strategy. However, these programs are costly and labor intensive. A new approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can significantly reduce the cost and time required to collect data while ensuring more accurate predictions than traditional methods. This study proposes a novel framework that combines DRL agents with probabilistic graphical models to predict likelihoods of mosquito infestation and presence of parasites in households over short intervals. We apply our model on real world datasets and demonstrate significant improvement over conventional surveys through extensive experiments. Our work has important implications for improving decision making processes related to vector borne diseases in developing countries where resources are often constrained. Ultimately, we envision the use of this tool to support decision makers at multiple levels ranging from community workers to policymakers by providing actionable insights based on predicted malaria likelihood.

"Reinforcement learning has shown promise in learning policies that can solve complex problems. However, manually specifying a good reward function can be difficult, especially for intricate tasks. Inverse reinforcement learning offers a useful paradigm to learn the underlying reward function directly from expert demonstrations. Yet in reality, the corpus of demonstrations may contain trajectories arising from a diverse set of underlying reward functions rather than a single one. Thus, in inverse reinforcement learning, it is useful to consider such a decomposition. The options framework in reinforcement learning is specifically designed to decompose policies in a similar light. We therefore extend the options framework and propose a method to simultaneously recover reward options in addition to policy options. We leverage adversarial methods to learn joint reward-policy options using only observed expert states. We show that this approach works well in both simple and complex continuous control tasks and shows significant performance increases in one-shot transfer learning.",0
"OptionGAN: Jointly Learning Rewards and Policies Through Generative Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning In recent years, inverse reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for acquiring meaningful behavior policies from raw observations. However, existing methods typically ignore the optionality in human behavior, which can severely limit their performance. To address this challenge, we propose OptionGAN: a novel framework that jointly learns reward functions and policy options through generative adversarial inverse RL. Our key insight lies in formulating the optimization problem using a variational lower bound on the expected return under uncertainty, which allows us to combine maximum entropy RL with a discriminator model. This leads to a closed-form solution that enables efficient policy evaluation and sampling, without sacrificing expressiveness. We demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple challenging domains, including Atari games and simulated robot locomotion tasks. OptionGAN shows promise towards solving sequential decision making problems efficiently and effectively, where rich domain knowledge may not be available.",1
"We present a new algorithm that significantly improves the efficiency of exploration for deep Q-learning agents in dialogue systems. Our agents explore via Thompson sampling, drawing Monte Carlo samples from a Bayes-by-Backprop neural network. Our algorithm learns much faster than common exploration strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy, Boltzmann, bootstrapping, and intrinsic-reward-based ones. Additionally, we show that spiking the replay buffer with experiences from just a few successful episodes can make Q-learning feasible when it might otherwise fail.",0
"In recent years, task-oriented dialogue systems have gained significant attention due to their ability to interact with users in natural language and perform tasks such as scheduling appointments, answering questions, and providing recommendations. These systems rely on deep reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize their behavior over time through trial and error interactions with real users. However, training these models can be computationally expensive, especially since they need millions of interactions to converge to good policies. This paper introduces BBQ-Networks, a novel architecture that leverages batch renormalization and quantum computing techniques to improve both efficiency and exploration capabilities during policy training. Our experiments show that our approach significantly reduces the number of episodes required to achieve similar levels of performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while improving the quality of generated responses. The proposed method has the potential to pave the way towards more scalable and efficient training of large language models for conversational agents.",1
"The problem of sparse rewards is one of the hardest challenges in contemporary reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) tackles this problem by using a set of temporally-extended actions, or options, each of which has its own subgoal. These subgoals are normally handcrafted for specific tasks. Here, though, we introduce a generic class of subgoals with broad applicability in the visual domain. Underlying our approach (in common with work using ""auxiliary tasks"") is the hypothesis that the ability to control aspects of the environment is an inherently useful skill to have. We incorporate such subgoals in an end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning system and test two variants of our algorithm on a number of games from the Atari suite. We highlight the advantage of our approach in one of the hardest games -- Montezuma's revenge -- for which the ability to handle sparse rewards is key. Our agent learns several times faster than the current state-of-the-art HRL agent in this game, reaching a similar level of performance. UPDATE 22/11/17: We found that a standard A3C agent with a simple shaped reward, i.e. extrinsic reward + feature control intrinsic reward, has comparable performance to our agent in Montezuma Revenge. In light of the new experiments performed, the advantage of our HRL approach can be attributed more to its ability to learn useful features from intrinsic rewards rather than its ability to explore and reuse abstracted skills with hierarchical components. This has led us to a new conclusion about the result.",0
"Abstract: This paper proposes feature control as an intrinsic motivation mechanism for hierarchical reinforcement learning agents. We present two approaches to incorporate intrinsic motivation inspired by curiosity modules found in animals such as insects, birds, mammals, and humans. Firstly, we propose that the agent should explore novel states produced via feature perturbations, where some properties of the environment are modified. Secondly, we suggest using self-play based on feature space modifications as an additional intrinsic motivator. Our methodologies enable exploration of high-dimensional spaces and speed up training times without human intervention or explicit task reward engineering. Results show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks from locomotion control to challenging Atari games. Our work shows how intrinsic motivation can guide exploration towards achieving desirable behaviors in complex environments.",1
"We address the problem of inverse reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes where the agent is risk-sensitive. In particular, we model risk-sensitivity in a reinforcement learning framework by making use of models of human decision-making having their origins in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and neuroscience. We propose a gradient-based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that minimizes a loss function defined on the observed behavior. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique on two examples, the first of which is the canonical Grid World example and the second of which is a Markov decision process modeling passengers' decisions regarding ride-sharing. In the latter, we use pricing and travel time data from a ride-sharing company to construct the transition probabilities and rewards of the Markov decision process.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to decision making under uncertainty. However, most existing methods assume that the agent seeks to maximize reward while minimizing risk, leading to suboptimal policies in high-risk environments. To address this issue, we propose inverse risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, which allows the agent to balance exploration and exploitation based on an adjustable level of risk tolerance. We formulate this framework using a novel measure of risk that captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Our method leverages Bayesian inference to update beliefs over time, incorporating prior knowledge and new observations into each decision. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods by adapting its behavior according to environmental changes, effectively balancing risk and reward tradeoffs. This work advances our understanding of how agents can learn efficiently in risky environments, opening up possibilities for applications across various domains where reliability is critical.",1
"In this work, we propose several online methods to build a \emph{learning curriculum} from a given set of target-task-specific training tasks in order to speed up reinforcement learning (RL). These methods can decrease the total training time needed by an RL agent compared to training on the target task from scratch. Unlike traditional transfer learning, we consider creating a sequence from several training tasks in order to provide the most benefit in terms of reducing the total time to train.   Our methods utilize the learning trajectory of the agent on the curriculum tasks seen so far to decide which tasks to train on next. An attractive feature of our methods is that they are weakly coupled to the choice of the RL algorithm as well as the transfer learning method. Further, when there is domain information available, our methods can incorporate such knowledge to further speed up the learning. We experimentally show that these methods can be used to obtain suitable learning curricula that speed up the overall training time on two different domains.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful approach to solving complex decision making problems. However, one major drawback of traditional reinforcement learning methods is their slow convergence rate, especially when dealing with large state spaces. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed using simulated environments, called ""active simulators,"" which can speed up the learning process by automatically generating new training data. This paper presents a novel algorithm that utilizes active simulators to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Our method combines the advantages of both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning approaches and exploits the unique properties of active simulators to achieve faster convergence rates. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods on several benchmark tasks, including a real-world robotic manipulation problem. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards faster and more efficient reinforcement learning solutions.",1
"A major bottleneck for developing general reinforcement learning agents is determining rewards that will yield desirable behaviors under various circumstances. We introduce a general mechanism for automatically specifying meaningful behaviors from raw pixels. In particular, we train a generative adversarial network to produce short sub-goals represented through motion templates. We demonstrate that this approach generates visually meaningful behaviors in unknown environments with novel agents and describe how these motions can be used to train reinforcement learning agents.",0
"Transfer Learning of Human Demonstrations for Robotics: Challenges and Opportunities  In recent years, robotic systems have been trained using human demonstration data as a means to imitate human behaviors. However, training these robots on large amounts of demonstration data can be challenging due to inconsistencies across different demonstrators. In addition, current methods use simple behavior cloning approaches without considering more advanced learning techniques such as imitation learning. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed motion generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a method to generate realistic and diverse motion trajectories based on a small set of example motions. This approach has shown promising results; however, it still faces several challenges that need to be addressed before it can be widely adopted in the field. Some key challenges include ensuring safety during interaction with humans and achieving effective generalization across environments and tasks. Nonetheless, despite these challenges, the use of transfer learning via motion GANs offers significant opportunities to improve robot performance, including enabling greater adaptability and flexibility in handling unexpected situations. Overall, future work should focus on addressing these challenges while leveraging the strengths offered by transfer learning via motion GANs.",1
"Techniques for automatically designing deep neural network architectures such as reinforcement learning based approaches have recently shown promising results. However, their success is based on vast computational resources (e.g. hundreds of GPUs), making them difficult to be widely used. A noticeable limitation is that they still design and train each network from scratch during the exploration of the architecture space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new framework toward efficient architecture search by exploring the architecture space based on the current network and reusing its weights. We employ a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller, whose action is to grow the network depth or layer width with function-preserving transformations. As such, the previously validated networks can be reused for further exploration, thus saves a large amount of computational cost. We apply our method to explore the architecture space of the plain convolutional neural networks (no skip-connections, branching etc.) on image benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN) with restricted computational resources (5 GPUs). Our method can design highly competitive networks that outperform existing networks using the same design scheme. On CIFAR-10, our model without skip-connections achieves 4.23\% test error rate, exceeding a vast majority of modern architectures and approaching DenseNet. Furthermore, by applying our method to explore the DenseNet architecture space, we are able to achieve more accurate networks with fewer parameters.",0
"This paper presents efficient architecture search by network transformation (NAS), which can rapidly explore a large solution space. We first introduce efficient ways to represent architectures as continuous vectors using neural architecture learning (NAL). Then we propose a novel NAS method called evolutionary discrete architecture representation by latent variable optimization (EDARLO) that optimizes these representations towards high validation accuracy across many tasks. EDARLO uses an offline phase to pretrain a generative model on existing architectures to learn the mapping from continuous architectural parameters to validation accuracy. During the online phase, a heuristics guided genetic algorithm iteratively modifies the input vector until it reaches architectures near peak performance at negligible computational cost compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets showing competitive results against prior art while running orders of magnitude faster. Our code is publicly available online.",1
"Despite significant progress in a variety of vision-and-language problems, developing a method capable of asking intelligent, goal-oriented questions about images is proven to be an inscrutable challenge. Towards this end, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework based on three new intermediate rewards, namely goal-achieved, progressive and informativeness that encourage the generation of succinct questions, which in turn uncover valuable information towards the overall goal. By directly optimizing for questions that work quickly towards fulfilling the overall goal, we avoid the tendency of existing methods to generate long series of insane queries that add little value. We evaluate our model on the GuessWhat?! dataset and show that the resulting questions can help a standard Guesser identify a specific object in an image at a much higher success rate.",0
"This study presents a novel approach to generating visually grounded questions that require complex reasoning to answer. Traditional approaches to question generation rely on rule-based systems, but these often struggle with more open-ended and difficult tasks. Instead, we propose using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate questions that require intermediate rewards to achieve their goals. We train our model on a large dataset of questions and images, and evaluate its performance on a range of question types and difficulty levels. Our results show that our method outperforms baseline models across all metrics, including success rate, diversity, and informativeness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to a real-world application scenario where the goal is to identify the most important visual features from a set of medical images. Overall, our work shows great potential for advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision and natural language processing.",1
"The Visual Dialogue task requires an agent to engage in a conversation about an image with a human. It represents an extension of the Visual Question Answering task in that the agent needs to answer a question about an image, but it needs to do so in light of the previous dialogue that has taken place. The key challenge in Visual Dialogue is thus maintaining a consistent, and natural dialogue while continuing to answer questions correctly. We present a novel approach that combines Reinforcement Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate more human-like responses to questions. The GAN helps overcome the relative paucity of training data, and the tendency of the typical MLE-based approach to generate overly terse answers. Critically, the GAN is tightly integrated into the attention mechanism that generates human-interpretable reasons for each answer. This means that the discriminative model of the GAN has the task of assessing whether a candidate answer is generated by a human or not, given the provided reason. This is significant because it drives the generative model to produce high quality answers that are well supported by the associated reasoning. The method also generates the state-of-the-art results on the primary benchmark.",0
"In this research study we investigate whether generative pretrained models can perform well on large scale visual dialog tasks. We present a new model that incorporates both generative and discriminator components which allows it to better reason and generate responses to questions posed by users. Our model utilizes adversarial learning techniques during training to improve performance on these tasks. Through rigorous evaluation we demonstrate that our model achieves state of the art results across multiple benchmark datasets while being less computationally expensive than previous approaches. By introducing a robust framework that leverages both generation and discrimination, we open up exciting possibilities for future work in the field of conversational agents.",1
"The Deep Q-Network proposed by Mnih et al. [2015] has become a benchmark and building point for much deep reinforcement learning research. However, replicating results for complex systems is often challenging since original scientific publications are not always able to describe in detail every important parameter setting and software engineering solution. In this paper, we present results from our work reproducing the results of the DQN paper. We highlight key areas in the implementation that were not covered in great detail in the original paper to make it easier for researchers to replicate these results, including termination conditions and gradient descent algorithms. Finally, we discuss methods for improving the computational performance and provide our own implementation that is designed to work with a range of domains, and not just the original Arcade Learning Environment [Bellemare et al., 2013].",0

They focus on explaining how to set up the environment, how to define rewards, and how to design the neural network architecture.

"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral skills, but real-world application of these methods requires a large amount of experience to be collected by the agent. In practical settings, such as robotics, this involves repeatedly attempting a task, resetting the environment between each attempt. However, not all tasks are easily or automatically reversible. In practice, this learning process requires extensive human intervention. In this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and reset policy, with the reset policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the reset policy, we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts. Our experiments illustrate that proper use of the reset policy can greatly reduce the number of manual resets required to learn a task, can reduce the number of unsafe actions that lead to non-reversible states, and can automatically induce a curriculum.",0
"As artificial intelligence systems become more autonomous, learning from their environments without explicit human guidance, there is a pressing need to ensure that these agents act in safe and ethical ways. One approach to addressing this concern is through reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn optimal behavior based on rewards and punishments. However, traditional RL algorithms often result in suboptimal solutions due to a lack of exploration and the potential negative impacts of trial-and-error learning. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm called ""Leave No Trace"" (LNT) that balances exploitation and exploration while ensuring that the agent's actions have minimal environmental impact. LNT achieves this by introducing a concept of ""resetting"" the environment after each action, allowing the agent to explore new actions without leaving lasting effects on the state of the world. We evaluate our algorithm using simulation studies across multiple domains and demonstrate that LNT outperforms baseline methods in terms of both efficiency and safety. Our results suggest that reset mechanisms could play a crucial role in enabling safe and efficient autonomous decision making in complex real-world settings. By promoting responsible learning behaviors and reducing the risk of unintended consequences, LNT represents a significant step towards creating intelligent agents that act as stewards rather than threats to their surroundings.",1
"Recently it has been shown that policy-gradient methods for reinforcement learning can be utilized to train deep end-to-end systems directly on non-differentiable metrics for the task at hand. In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing image captioning systems using reinforcement learning, and show that by carefully optimizing our systems using the test metrics of the MSCOCO task, significant gains in performance can be realized. Our systems are built using a new optimization approach that we call self-critical sequence training (SCST). SCST is a form of the popular REINFORCE algorithm that, rather than estimating a ""baseline"" to normalize the rewards and reduce variance, utilizes the output of its own test-time inference algorithm to normalize the rewards it experiences. Using this approach, estimating the reward signal (as actor-critic methods must do) and estimating normalization (as REINFORCE algorithms typically do) is avoided, while at the same time harmonizing the model with respect to its test-time inference procedure. Empirically we find that directly optimizing the CIDEr metric with SCST and greedy decoding at test-time is highly effective. Our results on the MSCOCO evaluation sever establish a new state-of-the-art on the task, improving the best result in terms of CIDEr from 104.9 to 114.7.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have been shown to greatly improve image classification accuracy through data augmentation, regularization, and architectural improvements such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most current methods rely on large amounts of manually labeled data that can be expensive and time consuming to acquire and annotate. One potential solution to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is self-supervised training using automatically generated negative examples, which has proven effective at improving performance without additional human labels. This work presents an alternative approach called sequence training, where we generate both positive and negative exemplars via sampling from previously seen ground truth captions during each epoch. Our method combines multiple types of negative samples including hard negatives, random noise, and even correct predictions from previous iterations, enabling more robust learning that adapts to changing model quality over time. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy on three benchmark datasets against other state-of-the-art self-supervised alternatives while utilizing only 20% of the original annotations. We hope our study encourages further exploration into efficient, unsupervised ways to fine-tune vision models for applications such as automatic image caption generation, object detection, and visual question answering.",1
"We consider a reinforcement learning (RL) setting in which the agent interacts with a sequence of episodic MDPs. At the start of each episode the agent has access to some side-information or context that determines the dynamics of the MDP for that episode. Our setting is motivated by applications in healthcare where baseline measurements of a patient at the start of a treatment episode form the context that may provide information about how the patient might respond to treatment decisions. We propose algorithms for learning in such Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under an assumption that the unobserved MDP parameters vary smoothly with the observed context. We also give lower and upper PAC bounds under the smoothness assumption. Because our lower bound has an exponential dependence on the dimension, we consider a tractable linear setting where the context is used to create linear combinations of a finite set of MDPs. For the linear setting, we give a PAC learning algorithm based on KWIK learning techniques.",0
"In the field of decision making under uncertainty, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been widely used as a mathematical framework to model situations where an agent must make choices that maximize some reward over time while facing unknown future events. However, many real world applications involve additional sources of side information that can provide valuable information to the agent, but are often ignored in traditional MDP models.  This paper proposes a new approach to handle continuous side information in MDPs, by augmenting the standard state representation with a set of features that capture relevant aspects of the side information. We develop algorithms to learn optimal policies based on these augmented representations, allowing agents to leverage available side information to improve their decision making. Our approach builds upon previous work in learning with expert advice, and incorporates techniques from Bayesian optimization to efficiently search through high dimensional spaces of features.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing approaches on a variety of domains, including healthcare resource allocation problems and traffic signal timing control tasks. Overall, we show how careful design of feature representations can significantly enhance decision making performance even in challenging problem settings with high dimensional continuous side information.",1
"We present the Variational Adaptive Newton (VAN) method which is a black-box optimization method especially suitable for explorative-learning tasks such as active learning and reinforcement learning. Similar to Bayesian methods, VAN estimates a distribution that can be used for exploration, but requires computations that are similar to continuous optimization methods. Our theoretical contribution reveals that VAN is a second-order method that unifies existing methods in distinct fields of continuous optimization, variational inference, and evolution strategies. Our experimental results show that VAN performs well on a wide-variety of learning tasks. This work presents a general-purpose explorative-learning method that has the potential to improve learning in areas such as active learning and reinforcement learning.",0
"This abstract can go on my blog to explain what your research is all about. Your writing style should be informal but still technical enough that someone who has knowledge in machine learning would understand your concepts. If possible, please include two references (one from Arxiv preprints) in addition to any citations within the text. And here’s some background context: The problem you solved was improving performance in deep learning problems where data collection may change over time due to evolving user preferences, new device types, etc. You created a method called variational adaptive Newton (VAN). Here’s more detail: You use stochastic gradient descent updates in VAN. The updates occur at different rates based on individual model components; those updating faster tend to have larger learning rates. At each step of optimization, VAN computes a batch of gradients, then checks whether any changes significantly improve validation accuracy, according to the KL divergence. In practice, if there aren’t many improvements happening across updates, then the optimization process slows down. Your experiments showed consistent performance gains using your technique compared to existing alternatives like Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad, Nadam, and others. Reference 24 from ArXiv shows similar recent work in exploring improved optimization algorithms.",1
"This paper formalises the problem of online algorithm selection in the context of Reinforcement Learning. The setup is as follows: given an episodic task and a finite number of off-policy RL algorithms, a meta-algorithm has to decide which RL algorithm is in control during the next episode so as to maximize the expected return. The article presents a novel meta-algorithm, called Epochal Stochastic Bandit Algorithm Selection (ESBAS). Its principle is to freeze the policy updates at each epoch, and to leave a rebooted stochastic bandit in charge of the algorithm selection. Under some assumptions, a thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates its near-optimality considering the structural sampling budget limitations. ESBAS is first empirically evaluated on a dialogue task where it is shown to outperform each individual algorithm in most configurations. ESBAS is then adapted to a true online setting where algorithms update their policies after each transition, which we call SSBAS. SSBAS is evaluated on a fruit collection task where it is shown to adapt the stepsize parameter more efficiently than the classical hyperbolic decay, and on an Atari game, where it improves the performance by a wide margin.",0
"Abstract: Selecting the appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm for a given task can greatly impact the performance of the learned model. In many cases, there are multiple algorithms available that could potentially solve the problem at hand. Therefore, selecting the most suitable one becomes crucial. This paper proposes a systematic approach to evaluate different reinforcement learning algorithms based on their characteristics and suitability for specific tasks. The proposed methodology includes evaluating each algorithm according to its complexity, sample efficiency, and scalability, as well as assessing how well each algorithm handles high dimensional state spaces, stochasticity, deceptiveness, and partial observability. By considering these factors, we provide guidance on choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem domain. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the performance of several popular RL algorithms on benchmark problems, thereby providing insights into which algorithm would perform better under certain conditions.",1
"We consider tackling a single-agent RL problem by distributing it to $n$ learners. These learners, called advisors, endeavour to solve the problem from a different focus. Their advice, taking the form of action values, is then communicated to an aggregator, which is in control of the system. We show that the local planning method for the advisors is critical and that none of the ones found in the literature is flawless: the egocentric planning overestimates values of states where the other advisors disagree, and the agnostic planning is inefficient around danger zones. We introduce a novel approach called empathic and discuss its theoretical aspects. We empirically examine and validate our theoretical findings on a fruit collection task.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for sequential decision making tasks. One challenge that arises in these settings is how to effectively incorporate multiple sources of advice into the RL algorithm. In many real world scenarios, agents may have access to several advisors who can provide valuable insights and guidance. However, simply following all available advice can lead to suboptimal policies as well as overfitting to specific instances. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called multi-advisor reinforcement learning (MARL). Our method allows the agent to selectively use different pieces of advice based on their relevance to the current task at hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluation on benchmark domains where agents must coordinate with other advisors to achieve their goals. Results show that MARL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness to changes in the environment. Our work contributes to the growing body of research exploring how machine learning techniques can be used to develop intelligent agents capable of interacting with complex environments and human collaborators.",1
"Humans process visual scenes selectively and sequentially using attention. Central to models of human visual attention is the saliency map. We propose a hierarchical visual architecture that operates on a saliency map and uses a novel attention mechanism to sequentially focus on salient regions and take additional glimpses within those regions. The architecture is motivated by human visual attention, and is used for multi-label image classification on a novel multiset task, demonstrating that it achieves high precision and recall while localizing objects with its attention. Unlike conventional multi-label image classification models, the model supports multiset prediction due to a reinforcement-learning based training process that allows for arbitrary label permutation and multiple instances per label.",0
"This would be good: Abstract We present a new approach that combines saliency models (such as DeepGaze) with sequential image attention models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

"Reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm for learning optimal policies from experimental data. However, to find optimal policies, most reinforcement learning algorithms explore all possible actions, which may be harmful for real-world systems. As a consequence, learning algorithms are rarely applied on safety-critical systems in the real world. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that explicitly considers safety, defined in terms of stability guarantees. Specifically, we extend control-theoretic results on Lyapunov stability verification and show how to use statistical models of the dynamics to obtain high-performance control policies with provable stability certificates. Moreover, under additional regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior, we prove that one can effectively and safely collect data in order to learn about the dynamics and thus both improve control performance and expand the safe region of the state space. In our experiments, we show how the resulting algorithm can safely optimize a neural network policy on a simulated inverted pendulum, without the pendulum ever falling down.",0
"In recent years, model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant attention as a promising approach for solving challenging decision making problems in complex, uncertain environments. However, existing model-based RL algorithms still suffer from several limitations that hinder their effectiveness and safety in real-world applications. For instance, model misspecification can lead to poor optimization goals, unstable planning, or even catastrophic failures, which may harm human operators or other agents in the environment. Additionally, most model-based approaches rely on handcrafted models that are difficult to obtain and maintain, limiting their scalability to large or dynamic domains. To address these issues, we propose a novel safe model-based RL algorithm that ensures both stability guarantees under uncertainty and convergence to optimal policies in simple, certain environments. Our method combines two components: local model training using domain knowledge, such as physics engines, and global policy improvement through iterative refinement guided by uncertainty estimation. We demonstrate our framework on multiple robotics tasks, including locomotion control, navigation, and manipulation, where our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods while guaranteeing safe executions even under severe environmental changes. Finally, we discuss future directions and potential extensions of our work, emphasizing generality across different scenarios and theoretical foundations based on sensitivity analysis in RL settings.

"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful framework for deep generative modeling. Posed as a two-player minimax problem, GANs are typically trained end-to-end on real-valued data and can be used to train a generator of high-dimensional and realistic images. However, a major limitation of GANs is that training relies on passing gradients from the discriminator through the generator via back-propagation. This makes it fundamentally difficult to train GANs with discrete data, as generation in this case typically involves a non-differentiable function. These difficulties extend to the reinforcement learning setting when the action space is composed of discrete decisions. We address these issues by reframing the GAN framework so that the generator is no longer trained using gradients through the discriminator, but is instead trained using a learned critic in the actor-critic framework with a Temporal Difference (TD) objective. This is a natural fit for sequence modeling and we use it to achieve improvements on language modeling tasks over the standard Teacher-Forcing methods.",0
"This paper presents a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm called ACtuAL (Actor-Critic under Adversarial Learning).

Our experiments on several benchmark continuous control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms such as TD3 and SAC.",1
"Despite widespread interests in reinforcement-learning for task-oriented dialogue systems, several obstacles can frustrate research and development progress. First, reinforcement learners typically require interaction with the environment, so conventional dialogue corpora cannot be used directly. Second, each task presents specific challenges, requiring separate corpus of task-specific annotated data. Third, collecting and annotating human-machine or human-human conversations for task-oriented dialogues requires extensive domain knowledge. Because building an appropriate dataset can be both financially costly and time-consuming, one popular approach is to build a user simulator based upon a corpus of example dialogues. Then, one can train reinforcement learning agents in an online fashion as they interact with the simulator. Dialogue agents trained on these simulators can serve as an effective starting point. Once agents master the simulator, they may be deployed in a real environment to interact with humans, and continue to be trained online. To ease empirical algorithmic comparisons in dialogues, this paper introduces a new, publicly available simulation framework, where our simulator, designed for the movie-booking domain, leverages both rules and collected data. The simulator supports two tasks: movie ticket booking and movie seeking. Finally, we demonstrate several agents and detail the procedure to add and test your own agent in the proposed framework.",0
In this paper we describe our user simulator designed to generate task completion dialogues. Our approach builds on previous work that used search techniques to generate dialogue from scratch without any predefined templates or examples. We extend their method by incorporating additional knowledge into the simulation process through an external module called KBGen (Knowledge Base Generator). KBGen generates a set of rules that define how different system actions affect relevant features in a dialogue’s output. This allows us to create more realistic simulations since these rules can represent common sense assumptions and constraints of task-oriented conversational agents. To evaluate our approach we compare our generated dialogues against human ratings obtained through crowdsource studies. Results show that our model significantly outperforms baseline models improving both fluency and coherence aspects of the generated dialogues. Additionally we provide qualitative analysis showing the impact of KBGen in generating richer interactions between agent and users as well as better handling of errors and clarification requests during task execution. Finally we discuss possible future directions and limitations of our current approach.,1
"This paper explores the non-convex composition optimization in the form including inner and outer finite-sum functions with a large number of component functions. This problem arises in some important applications such as nonlinear embedding and reinforcement learning. Although existing approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) descent can be applied to solve this problem, their query complexity tends to be high, especially when the number of inner component functions is large. In this paper, we apply the variance-reduced technique to derive two variance reduced algorithms that significantly improve the query complexity if the number of inner component functions is large. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes the query complexity analysis for non-convex stochastic composition. Experiments validate the proposed algorithms and theoretical analysis.",0
"The problem of non-convex composition optimization has recently gained significant attention due to its numerous applications in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing.

Our approach reduces the variance in the estimated gradients, enabling faster convergence and improved accuracy without increasing computational cost. We evaluate our VRM on several benchmark datasets commonly used in image generation tasks, and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of speed, efficiency, and quality of generated images. Our results provide important insights into the effectiveness of variance reduction methods for non-convex composition optimization and open new research directions towards developing more efficient algorithms for large-scale data analysis.",1
"Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with latent variables are probabilistic models which can automatically identify complex stochastic patterns in the data. We describe and study in these models a decomposition of predictive uncertainty into its epistemic and aleatoric components. First, we show how such a decomposition arises naturally in a Bayesian active learning scenario by following an information theoretic approach. Second, we use a similar decomposition to develop a novel risk sensitive objective for safe reinforcement learning (RL). This objective minimizes the effect of model bias in environments whose stochastic dynamics are described by BNNs with latent variables. Our experiments illustrate the usefulness of the resulting decomposition in active learning and safe RL settings.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing methods that can effectively model uncertainty in deep learning systems, particularly in situations where data is limited or noisy. One approach that has gained attention is the use of latent variable models within a probabilistic framework. These models allow us to capture both aleatoric (data-based) and epistemic (model-based) sources of uncertainty, making them well suited for problems where we have imperfect knowledge or measurements.  In our work, we propose a novel methodology for decomposing uncertainty in neural networks equipped with latent variables using Bayesian inference techniques. Our approach is based on a variational autoencoder architecture that learns jointly to reconstruct inputs from their encoded representations as well as predict the noise or corruption present in each input sample. By doing so, we obtain a posterior distribution over the latent space which captures all types of uncertainties inherently present in the model. We then leverage this distribution to compute several key uncertainty metrics such as entropy, mutual information, and KL divergence, providing insights into how different aspects of the problem impact the total uncertainty across the system.  Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology across multiple benchmark datasets spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition tasks. Importantly, we showcase cases where competitive accuracies are achieved alongside significantly higher levels of calibrated uncertainty estimates. This indicates that incorporating uncertainty directly during training leads to more robust predictions and provides the practitioner valuable guidance on how to design better machine learning pipelines when precise error quantification is essential. Overall, our work paves the way towards building more reliable artificial intelligence solutions by embracing uncertainty as a fundamental aspect of deep learning systems.",1

"We study reinforcement learning under model misspecification, where we do not have access to the true environment but only to a reasonably close approximation to it. We address this problem by extending the framework of robust MDPs to the model-free Reinforcement Learning setting, where we do not have access to the model parameters, but can only sample states from it. We define robust versions of Q-learning, SARSA, and TD-learning and prove convergence to an approximately optimal robust policy and approximate value function respectively. We scale up the robust algorithms to large MDPs via function approximation and prove convergence under two different settings.

"Methods for neural network hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling are computationally expensive due to the need to train a large number of model configurations. In this paper, we show that standard frequentist regression models can predict the final performance of partially trained model configurations using features based on network architectures, hyperparameters, and time-series validation performance data. We empirically show that our performance prediction models are much more effective than prominent Bayesian counterparts, are simpler to implement, and are faster to train. Our models can predict final performance in both visual classification and language modeling domains, are effective for predicting performance of drastically varying model architectures, and can even generalize between model classes. Using these prediction models, we also propose an early stopping method for hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling, which obtains a speedup of a factor up to 6x in both hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling. Finally, we empirically show that our early stopping method can be seamlessly incorporated into both reinforcement learning-based architecture selection algorithms and bandit based search methods. Through extensive experimentation, we empirically show our performance prediction models and early stopping algorithm are state-of-the-art in terms of prediction accuracy and speedup achieved while still identifying the optimal model configurations.",0

"Introduction In recent years, there has been significant advancement in generative models such as GPT-4 from OpenAI which have demonstrated state of the art results on numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models use deep learning techniques that enable them to generate human-like text by learning statistical patterns found within large amounts of data. However, despite their impressive performance, generative models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks where small perturbations to input can cause drastic changes in output. This paper explores latent poisoning attacks on GPT-2 latent space and proposes novel approaches to mitigate these threats. Methodology To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies, we conducted experiments using the Hugging Face transformers library in combination with the Latent Pointer toolkit to craft adversarial inputs targeting GPT-2 model at different layers. We compared the strength of latent poisoning attacks against pretrained GPT-2 variants (small, medium, large) across three distinct NLP datasets. Our evaluation metrics included success rate, average perplexity, and proportion of successful attacks. Results were analyzed statistically using paired t-tests and confidence intervals. Results Our findings showed that GPT-2 models are indeed susceptible to latent poisoning attacks. The attack success rates increased consistently across all model sizes as well as dataset domains. However, we observed reduced perplexity scores following successful attacks indicating degradation in model quality. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that randomizing embeddings before fine-tuning led to substantial drop in success rates (>6%) for medium size models, while no noticeable reduction occurred wi",1
"It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples. In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear. Here we argue that the origin of adversarial examples is primarily due to an inherent uncertainty that neural networks have about their predictions. We show that the functional form of this uncertainty is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; and depends only on the statistics of the logit differences of the network, which do not change significantly during training. This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD). Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness. Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity. To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10. Our resulting architecture is more robust to white \emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.",0
"Advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in many tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, there remain some fundamental limitations in our understanding of how these models work, particularly regarding their robustness to input perturbations. This paper focuses on adversarial examples - deliberately crafted inputs that cause neural networks to make incorrect predictions despite having high confidence in their outputs. We explore several intriguing properties of adversarial examples, including their generalization across different architectures and training settings, their ability to transfer from one task to another within the same model, and their similarity to human perception failures. Our findings highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches to designing robust machine learning algorithms, and suggest promising directions for future research. By shedding light on the nature of adversarial vulnerability, we aim to contribute towards building more trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.",1
"We show how an ensemble of $Q^*$-functions can be leveraged for more effective exploration in deep reinforcement learning. We build on well established algorithms from the bandit setting, and adapt them to the $Q$-learning setting. We propose an exploration strategy based on upper-confidence bounds (UCB). Our experiments show significant gains on the Atari benchmark.",0
"Title: ""Exploring Uncertainty via Ensemble Methods""  In recent years, uncertainty has emerged as a critical factor in decision making across many domains, from autonomous systems to financial forecasting. One popular method for addressing uncertainty in machine learning is through ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness. However, traditional ensemble techniques often struggle to effectively capture high levels of uncertainty. This work proposes an alternative approach using Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) exploration, which takes into account both model uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. We demonstrate that our proposed Q-Ensemble method outperforms state-of-the art ensembling techniques on several benchmark datasets, even in scenarios where these other approaches perform poorly. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating more nuanced views of uncertainty into machine learning algorithms. They further suggest that there may still be significant room for improvement in how we model and handle uncertainty within the field, particularly at higher levels of complexity.",1
"Boltzmann exploration is a classic strategy for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, and is one of the most standard tools in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Despite its widespread use, there is virtually no theoretical understanding about the limitations or the actual benefits of this exploration scheme. Does it drive exploration in a meaningful way? Is it prone to misidentifying the optimal actions or spending too much time exploring the suboptimal ones? What is the right tuning for the learning rate? In this paper, we address several of these questions in the classic setup of stochastic multi-armed bandits. One of our main results is showing that the Boltzmann exploration strategy with any monotone learning-rate sequence will induce suboptimal behavior. As a remedy, we offer a simple non-monotone schedule that guarantees near-optimal performance, albeit only when given prior access to key problem parameters that are typically not available in practical situations (like the time horizon $T$ and the suboptimality gap $\Delta$). More importantly, we propose a novel variant that uses different learning rates for different arms, and achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound of order $\frac{K\log^2 T}{\Delta}$ and a distribution-independent bound of order $\sqrt{KT}\log K$ without requiring such prior knowledge. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we also propose a variant that guarantees the same performance bounds even if the rewards are heavy-tailed.",0
"Abstract:  Exploratory research in robotics faces significant challenges due to the high complexity of robots, their environments, and the interactions between them. This complexity leads to a vast search space that needs to be systematically explored. One popular approach to explore these spaces efficiently is through random sampling methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, MCTS algorithms are often criticized for producing uninformative samples due to poor selection strategies or failure to balance exploration versus exploitation effectively. These problems can lead to slow convergence rates and biased results. To address these concerns, we propose a new algorithm called Boltzmann Exploration Done Right (BEDR), which utilizes a probabilistically inspired method based on energy function estimation. BEDR balances both exploration and exploitation by leveraging a temperature hyperparameter, allowing us to control the level of diversity introduced into the search space. We evaluate our approach using experiments in simulated domains across a variety of robotic tasks and show that BEDR outperforms other state-of-the art methods in terms of efficiency, quality of solutions found, and robustness against parameter settings. Overall, BEDR provides a promising alternative to existing approaches for efficient exploration in complex robotics tasks. Our work contributes to the field of artificial intelligence and automation research, opening up opportunities for more effective learning in robot systems.",1
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) can model complex behavior policies for goal-directed sequential decision making tasks. A hallmark of RL algorithms is Temporal Difference (TD) learning: value function for the current state is moved towards a bootstrapped target that is estimated using next state's value function. $\lambda$-returns generalize beyond 1-step returns and strike a balance between Monte Carlo and TD learning methods. While lambda-returns have been extensively studied in RL, they haven't been explored a lot in Deep RL. This paper's first contribution is an exhaustive benchmarking of lambda-returns. Although mathematically tractable, the use of exponentially decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a rather ad-hoc design choice. Our second major contribution is that we propose a generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns (CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an end-to-end manner. This allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants to weigh the n-step returns based targets. In contrast, lambda-returns restrict RL agents to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme. Autodidactic returns can be used for improving any RL algorithm which uses TD learning. We empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the use of n-step returns. We perform our experiments on the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm in the Atari 2600 domain.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach for training agents that can perform complex tasks. However, one challenge faced by such algorithms is their tendency to overfit to specific trajectories, which can limit generalization performance on novel sequences or environments. To address this issue, we propose a new algorithm called Learn2Mix, which learns to generate multiple trajectory segments conditioned on the current state and action pair, rather than just producing single trajectory steps like previous methods based on returns. Our method uses a mixture model that dynamically generates fixed-length context chunks, capturing diverse behaviors in parallel, and improves exploration by mixing these diverse models at inference time. We evaluate our algorithm across several challenging continuous control benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority compared to baseline approaches. By effectively generating multi-step predictions, Learn2Mix leads to better policy optimization, resulting in improved performance across all task domains. This work represents a significant step towards enabling more capable RL agents through flexible generation of trajectories beyond the standard lambda return formulation.",1
"Conventional reinforcement learning methods for Markov decision processes rely on weakly-guided, stochastic searches to drive the learning process. It can therefore be difficult to predict what agent behaviors might emerge. In this paper, we consider an information-theoretic cost function for performing constrained stochastic searches that promote the formation of risk-averse to risk-favoring behaviors. This cost function is the value of information, which provides the optimal trade-off between the expected return of a policy and the policy's complexity; policy complexity is measured by number of bits and controlled by a single hyperparameter on the cost function. As the policy complexity is reduced, the agents will increasingly eschew risky actions. This reduces the potential for high accrued rewards. As the policy complexity increases, the agents will take actions, regardless of the risk, that can raise the long-term rewards. The obtainable reward depends on a single, tunable hyperparameter that regulates the degree of policy complexity.   We evaluate the performance of value-of-information-based policies on a stochastic version of Ms. Pac-Man. A major component of this paper is the demonstration that ranges of policy complexity values yield different game-play styles and explaining why this occurs. We also show that our reinforcement-learning search mechanism is more efficient than the others we utilize. This result implies that the value of information theory is appropriate for framing the exploitation-exploration trade-off in reinforcement learning.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to control challenging domains where agents must interact with complex environments and opponents that exhibit unpredictability and adaptivity. One such domain is video games, which provide both an accessible environment for experimentation as well as a setting with real-world applications in robotics and other areas. This study examines how RL can be used to develop effective agent policies in a difficult game: Ms. Pac-Man. The authors introduce value-of-information-based policies that use models to represent uncertainty over environmental conditions, allowing the agent to optimize actions based on the expected impact they have on future rewards. They evaluate these policies against several baseline methods, including model-free deep Q-learning and model-assisted Monte Carlo tree search. Through extensive experimentation across multiple settings, they demonstrate that their approach outperforms prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of score, win rate, and expert metrics. These findings suggest that value-of-information-based policies offer a promising direction for developing high-performing RL algorithms capable of solving even the most challenging problems under imperfect information. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of how to leverage uncertainty and knowledge representations to create intelligent, versatile agents that excel in complex interactive environments.",1
"Learning to communicate through interaction, rather than relying on explicit supervision, is often considered a prerequisite for developing a general AI. We study a setting where two agents engage in playing a referential game and, from scratch, develop a communication protocol necessary to succeed in this game. Unlike previous work, we require that messages they exchange, both at train and test time, are in the form of a language (i.e. sequences of discrete symbols). We compare a reinforcement learning approach and one using a differentiable relaxation (straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimator) and observe that the latter is much faster to converge and it results in more effective protocols. Interestingly, we also observe that the protocol we induce by optimizing the communication success exhibits a degree of compositionality and variability (i.e. the same information can be phrased in different ways), both properties characteristic of natural languages. As the ultimate goal is to ensure that communication is accomplished in natural language, we also perform experiments where we inject prior information about natural language into our model and study properties of the resulting protocol.",0
"In this work we investigate how language can emerge from multi-agent games where agents learn to communicate by choosing sequences of symbols. We show that even simple mechanisms such as repetition and rejection can lead to the development of diverse linguistic phenomena including phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Our findings suggest that communicative pressures alone may suffice to bootstrap early stages of linguistic development without recourse to genetic endowments or external feedback. More broadly, our results contribute to ongoing efforts in artificial intelligence to model the complex dynamics underlying human social interactions and cultural evolution.

"In recent years, neural networks have enjoyed a renaissance as function approximators in reinforcement learning. Two decades after Tesauro's TD-Gammon achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600 games. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we propose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU). The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by its input. Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and softmax action selection with simple annealing can be competitive with DQN, without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10$\times$10 board, using TD($\lambda$) learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa($\lambda$) agent with SiLU and dSiLU hidden units.",0
"In recent years, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have gained popularity as function approximators in reinforcement learning applications due to their ability to capture complex relationships and generalize well on unseen data. However, traditional activation functions such as sigmoid or ReLU often used in these models can lead to vanishing gradients during training, resulting in slow convergence or even instability in certain cases. This paper proposes the use of sigmoid-weighted linear units (SWLUs), which combines the advantages of both sigmoidal and rectified linear activations. We show that SWLUs provide better gradient propagation and faster convergence compared to standard sigmoid and ReLU activations in several benchmark tasks across different domains, including gridworld environments, continuous control problems, and games. Our results suggest that SWLUs offer a promising alternative for function approximation in RL algorithms, especially in scenarios where robustness to vanishing gradients is critical.",1
"Approximate dynamic programming algorithms, such as approximate value iteration, have been successfully applied to many complex reinforcement learning tasks, and a better approximate dynamic programming algorithm is expected to further extend the applicability of reinforcement learning to various tasks. In this paper we propose a new, robust dynamic programming algorithm that unifies value iteration, advantage learning, and dynamic policy programming. We call it generalized value iteration (GVI) and its approximated version, approximate GVI (AGVI). We show AGVI's performance guarantee, which includes performance guarantees for existing algorithms, as special cases. We discuss theoretical weaknesses of existing algorithms, and explain the advantages of AGVI. Numerical experiments in a simple environment support theoretical arguments, and suggest that AGVI is a promising alternative to previous algorithms.",0
"This work presents a unified framework that encompasses three powerful algorithmic techniques for solving sequential decision making problems: value iteration, advantage learning, and dynamic policy programming.

Our method combines the strengths of these algorithms while addressing their limitations, resulting in more efficient and effective solutions across a range of challenging domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive empirical evaluations on both continuous control tasks and traditional game environments, outperforming benchmark methods in most cases. Our results highlight the potential impact of our framework for designing intelligent agents that can make better decisions under uncertainty. Overall, this research represents an important step towards developing general tools for autonomous problem-solving in complex real-world settings.",1
"We develop a metalearning approach for learning hierarchically structured policies, improving sample efficiency on unseen tasks through the use of shared primitives---policies that are executed for large numbers of timesteps. Specifically, a set of primitives are shared within a distribution of tasks, and are switched between by task-specific policies. We provide a concrete metric for measuring the strength of such hierarchies, leading to an optimization problem for quickly reaching high reward on unseen tasks. We then present an algorithm to solve this problem end-to-end through the use of any off-the-shelf reinforcement learning method, by repeatedly sampling new tasks and resetting task-specific policies. We successfully discover meaningful motor primitives for the directional movement of four-legged robots, solely by interacting with distributions of mazes. We also demonstrate the transferability of primitives to solve long-timescale sparse-reward obstacle courses, and we enable 3D humanoid robots to robustly walk and crawl with the same policy.",0
"""Meta learning refers to techniques that enable artificial intelligence agents to learn how to learn more effectively.

"We examine the problem of learning mappings from state to state, suitable for use in a model-based reinforcement-learning setting, that simultaneously generalize to novel states and can capture stochastic transitions. We show that currently popular generative adversarial networks struggle to learn these stochastic transition models but a modification to their loss functions results in a powerful learning algorithm for this class of problems.",0
"In recent years, stochastic transition models (STMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex systems that involve uncertainty, randomness, or probabilistic behavior. These models capture how systems evolve over time by predicting transitions between different states based on probabilities rather than deterministic rules. However, due to the computational complexity involved in estimating STMs from data, most existing methods only focus on learning exact or approximate deterministic Markov chains, which can only represent a subset of possible behaviors.  In this work, we address the challenge of learning accurate and efficient approximations of high-dimensional stochastic transition matrices directly from observational data. We propose a novel methodology that uses gradient descent optimization to iteratively refine initial estimates of the matrix entries. Our approach exploits sparsity patterns inherent in the problem domain, resulting in more compact representations with fewer parameters while still preserving important system characteristics. To improve accuracy, our framework leverages knowledge distillation techniques inspired by deep learning to regularize the solution during optimization, encouraging predictions that closely resemble those of ground truth STMs.  We evaluate our method using both synthetic datasets and real-world examples from diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and social media. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of estimation error and computation speed. Furthermore, we showcase practical applications where learned STMs enable effective simulation and forecasting tasks, highlighting their utility in decision support and risk analysis under uncertain conditions. Overall, our research advances the development of scalable tools for representing and analyzing dynamic systems subjected to intrinsic uncertainties.",1
"We consider the composition optimization with two expected-value functions in the form of $\frac{1}{n}\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^n F_i(\frac{1}{m}\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^m G_j(x))+R(x)$, { which formulates many important problems in statistical learning and machine learning such as solving Bellman equations in reinforcement learning and nonlinear embedding}. Full Gradient or classical stochastic gradient descent based optimization algorithms are unsuitable or computationally expensive to solve this problem due to the inner expectation $\frac{1}{m}\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^m G_j(x)$. We propose a duality-free based stochastic composition method that combines variance reduction methods to address the stochastic composition problem. We apply SVRG and SAGA based methods to estimate the inner function, and duality-free method to estimate the outer function. We prove the linear convergence rate not only for the convex composition problem, but also for the case that the individual outer functions are non-convex while the objective function is strongly-convex. We also provide the results of experiments that show the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",0
"In recent years there has been growing interest in developing methods for stochastic composition optimization that can effectively balance duality and primal-dual properties. Existing approaches have often focused on using Lagrange dual functions as tools for both optimizing objectives and computing gradients of constraints. This has led to important theoretical advances but remains limited in practice by issues related to the need to maintain strong convexity and smoothness assumptions throughout the solution process. This work seeks to address these limitations by presenting a new family of algorithms based on minimizing quadratic objectives subject to linear inequality constraints. Our approach builds upon earlier ideas around proximal splitting techniques and combines them with novel regularizers tailored to exploit specific problem structures. We show how this leads to efficient and scalable solvers capable of handling challenging problems arising from applications such as machine learning and data analysis. A key contribution of our methodology is a proof of convergence rates under minimal conditions ensuring positive definiteness of underlying matrices. Unlike many prior works requiring stronger assumptions, we demonstrate that simple random initialization suffices to obtain provably correct results across a range of diverse examples. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach relative to competitive alternatives while highlighting its general applicability and versatility. Overall, our research contributes a promising new direction for tackling real-world optimization tasks involving uncertainty and noise",1
"Due to the lack of enough generalization in the state-space, common methods in Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffer from slow learning speed especially in the early learning trials. This paper introduces a model-based method in discrete state-spaces for increasing learning speed in terms of required experience (but not required computational time) by exploiting generalization in the experiences of the subspaces. A subspace is formed by choosing a subset of features in the original state representation (full-space). Generalization and faster learning in a subspace are due to many-to-one mapping of experiences from the full-space to each state in the subspace. Nevertheless, due to inherent perceptual aliasing in the subspaces, the policy suggested by each subspace does not generally converge to the optimal policy. Our approach, called Model Based Learning with Subspaces (MoBLeS), calculates confidence intervals of the estimated Q-values in the full-space and in the subspaces. These confidence intervals are used in the decision making, such that the agent benefits the most from the possible generalization while avoiding from detriment of the perceptual aliasing in the subspaces. Convergence of MoBLeS to the optimal policy is theoretically investigated. Additionally, we show through several experiments that MoBLeS improves the learning speed in the early trials.",0
"This paper presents two new methods for using prior knowledge from other tasks in order to improve performance on current task. We focus specifically on using generalization across different ""subspace"" representations as a key element of our approach; we show that carefully designing these can lead to significant improvements over previous work on transferring learned models. Firstly, we propose an extension of a previously popular method which allows for better control over both what features are used to guide adaptation and how they are combined at test time. By doing so, we find we obtain larger improvements across all evaluation metrics than alternative approaches. Secondly, we introduce a new algorithm based on recent advances in model compression which further boosts performance by storing only necessary parameters during adaptation - allowing more efficient use of resources when applying priors learned via multiple source domains. Overall we demonstrate substantial gains in several challenging benchmark settings (both supervised & unsupervised), validating the effectiveness of our novel methods within a variety of scenarios and thus paving the way towards real world applications where adaptability would greatly benefit society.",1
"Reinforcement Learning is divided in two main paradigms: model-free and model-based. Each of these two paradigms has strengths and limitations, and has been successfully applied to real world domains that are appropriate to its corresponding strengths. In this paper, we present a new approach aimed at bridging the gap between these two paradigms. We aim to take the best of the two paradigms and combine them in an approach that is at the same time data-efficient and cost-savvy. We do so by learning a probabilistic dynamics model and leveraging it as a prior for the intertwined model-free optimization. As a result, our approach can exploit the generality and structure of the dynamics model, but is also capable of ignoring its inevitable inaccuracies, by directly incorporating the evidence provided by the direct observation of the cost. Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach outperforms purely model-based and model-free approaches, as well as the approach of simply switching from a model-based to a model-free setting.",0
"Here’s your abstract – I wrote two versions! Which one do you like better? If neither makes sense let me know :). Abstract One:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as an alternative for classical planning techniques since it enables agents to learn their behavior online by trial and error. In contrast to model based approaches which suffer from high sample complexity, model free RL algorithms such as Q-learning only require very few interactions to work well under most conditions. An open problem remained however how these methods manage uncertainty without any explicit models at all (either dynamics models, value functions etc.). Recently, we have shown that even small random perturbations on top of the transition operator induce a bias towards selecting actions in the state space of the underlying MDP which resembles an optimal policy more than uniform selection (cf. figure). Our new result can now show that similar effects can happen if instead the noise comes from the feature expectations itself! We achieve this via projecting (or rather reconstructing!) a nonlinear basis into the linear span of some fixed features. While our bounds cannot yet guarantee fast convergence to the optimal policy they can provide an analysis why the same kind of prior can be used both for guiding exploration and regularization purposes – an issue which remains largely unresolved currently. Despite these limitations our results suggest a promising connection between intrinsic motivation and model priors which might eventually lead to a simpler understanding of model free learning problems.  Or here something else ? Abstract Two:  Recent research has demonstrated that tiny random perturbations over actual transitions significantly affect the performance of simple, model free reinforcement learning algorithms. These findings raise questions whether there exists truly “model-free” reinforcement learning, i.e., if methods actually use internal estimates about the environment and how it should behave. Motivated by our recent investigations showing that appropriate choice o",1
"Consider the problem of approximating the optimal policy of a Markov decision process (MDP) by sampling state transitions. In contrast to existing reinforcement learning methods that are based on successive approximations to the nonlinear Bellman equation, we propose a Primal-Dual $\pi$ Learning method in light of the linear duality between the value and policy. The $\pi$ learning method is model-free and makes primal-dual updates to the policy and value vectors as new data are revealed. For infinite-horizon undiscounted Markov decision process with finite state space $S$ and finite action space $A$, the $\pi$ learning method finds an $\epsilon$-optimal policy using the following number of sample transitions $$ \tilde{O}( \frac{(\tau\cdot t^*_{mix})^2 |S| |A| }{\epsilon^2} ),$$ where $t^*_{mix}$ is an upper bound of mixing times across all policies and $\tau$ is a parameter characterizing the range of stationary distributions across policies. The $\pi$ learning method also applies to the computational problem of MDP where the transition probabilities and rewards are explicitly given as the input. In the case where each state transition can be sampled in $\tilde{O}(1)$ time, the $\pi$ learning method gives a sublinear-time algorithm for solving the averaged-reward MDP.",0
"In this paper we present Primal-Dual $\pi$ learning (PDPL), a new algorithm that improves upon existing methods for solving Markov decision processes (MDP) by achieving better sample complexity rates and faster run times.

"This paper proposes a general method for improving the structure and quality of sequences generated by a recurrent neural network (RNN), while maintaining information originally learned from data, as well as sample diversity. An RNN is first pre-trained on data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and the probability distribution over the next token in the sequence learned by this model is treated as a prior policy. Another RNN is then trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the MLE RNN. To formalize this objective, we derive novel off-policy RL methods for RNNs from KL-control. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two applications; 1) generating novel musical melodies, and 2) computational molecular generation. For both problems, we show that the proposed method improves the desired properties and structure of the generated sequences, while maintaining information learned from data.",0

"The vision for precision medicine is to use individual patient characteristics to inform a personalized treatment plan that leads to the best healthcare possible for each patient. Mobile technologies have an important role to play in this vision as they offer a means to monitor a patient's health status in real-time and subsequently to deliver interventions if, when, and in the dose that they are needed. Dynamic treatment regimes formalize individualized treatment plans as sequences of decision rules, one per stage of clinical intervention, that map current patient information to a recommended treatment. However, existing methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes are designed for a small number of fixed decision points occurring on a coarse time-scale. We propose a new reinforcement learning method for estimating an optimal treatment regime that is applicable to data collected using mobile technologies in an outpatient setting. The proposed method accommodates an indefinite time horizon and minute-by-minute decision making that are common in mobile health applications.

"In this paper, a sparse Markov decision process (MDP) with novel causal sparse Tsallis entropy regularization is proposed.The proposed policy regularization induces a sparse and multi-modal optimal policy distribution of a sparse MDP. The full mathematical analysis of the proposed sparse MDP is provided.We first analyze the optimality condition of a sparse MDP. Then, we propose a sparse value iteration method which solves a sparse MDP and then prove the convergence and optimality of sparse value iteration using the Banach fixed point theorem. The proposed sparse MDP is compared to soft MDPs which utilize causal entropy regularization. We show that the performance error of a sparse MDP has a constant bound, while the error of a soft MDP increases logarithmically with respect to the number of actions, where this performance error is caused by the introduced regularization term. In experiments, we apply sparse MDPs to reinforcement learning problems. The proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of the convergence speed and performance.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing efficient methods for solving complex decision making problems in large state spaces. One approach that has gained popularity is sparse Markov Decision Process (sparse MDP) which uses sparsity constraints to reduce the size of the model without compromising its accuracy. However, selecting appropriate regularizers plays a crucial role in determining the performance of these models. This paper introduces a novel method called Sparse Markov Decision Processes with Causal Sparse Tsallis Entropy Regularization (SMDP-CSTER).  The proposed method integrates causal reasoning into the sparse MDP framework by leveraging structural causal models. By doing so, we can ensure that our learned policies only depend on relevant variables that have direct impacts on the outcome. Additionally, we employ Tsallis entropy as the regularizer, which allows us to better capture nonlinear dependencies among states and actions. We demonstrate through experiments using benchmark datasets that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach on real-world applications such as recommendation systems and sensor placements in smart buildings. Overall, our work contributes to advancing reinforcement learning research and provides practitioners with powerful tools for addressing challenging decision making problems.",1
"The Epicurean Philosophy is commonly thought as simplistic and hedonistic. Here I discuss how this is a misconception and explore its link to Reinforcement Learning. Based on the letters of Epicurus, I construct an objective function for hedonism which turns out to be equivalent of the Reinforcement Learning objective function when omitting the discount factor. I then discuss how Plato and Aristotle 's views that can be also loosely linked to Reinforcement Learning, as well as their weaknesses in relationship to it. Finally, I emphasise the close affinity of the Epicurean views and the Bellman equation.",0
"""This paper investigates whether Epicurus can be considered as one of the fathers of modern reinforcement learning (RL). By examining the ancient Greek philosopher’s views on ethics, we show how his belief that pleasure is the ultimate goal of life aligns closely with RL principles such as maximizing cumulative reward. Furthermore, we argue that Epicurus’ emphasis on using reason over fear or superstition anticipates similar ideas found in current machine learning research. Through our analysis, we aim to shed new light on a classic figure in Western philosophy, and offer insights into the potential connections between centuries-old thought and cutting-edge artificial intelligence.""

"Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and robotics for more than a decade since data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount of engineering knowledge, which is otherwise required. However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this article, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.",0

"Domain shift refers to the well known problem that a model trained in one source domain performs poorly when applied to a target domain with different statistics. {Domain Generalization} (DG) techniques attempt to alleviate this issue by producing models which by design generalize well to novel testing domains. We propose a novel {meta-learning} method for domain generalization. Rather than designing a specific model that is robust to domain shift as in most previous DG work, we propose a model agnostic training procedure for DG. Our algorithm simulates train/test domain shift during training by synthesizing virtual testing domains within each mini-batch. The meta-optimization objective requires that steps to improve training domain performance should also improve testing domain performance. This meta-learning procedure trains models with good generalization ability to novel domains. We evaluate our method and achieve state of the art results on a recent cross-domain image classification benchmark, as well demonstrating its potential on two classic reinforcement learning tasks.",0

"Feature representations from pre-trained deep neural networks have been known to exhibit excellent generalization and utility across a variety of related tasks. Fine-tuning is by far the simplest and most widely used approach that seeks to exploit and adapt these feature representations to novel tasks with limited data. Despite the effectiveness of fine-tuning, itis often sub-optimal and requires very careful optimization to prevent severe over-fitting to small datasets. The problem of sub-optimality and over-fitting, is due in part to the large number of parameters used in a typical deep convolutional neural network. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective regularization method for fine-tuning pre-trained deep networks for the task of k-shot learning. To prevent overfitting, our key strategy is to cluster the model parameters while ensuring intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster diversity of the parameters, effectively regularizing the dimensionality of the parameter search space. In particular, we identify groups of neurons within each layer of a deep network that shares similar activation patterns. When the network is to be fine-tuned for a classification task using only k examples, we propagate a single gradient to all of the neuron parameters that belong to the same group. The grouping of neurons is non-trivial as neuron activations depend on the distribution of the input data. To efficiently search for optimal groupings conditioned on the input data, we propose a reinforcement learning search strategy using recurrent networks to learn the optimal group assignments for each network layer. Experimental results show that our method can be easily applied to several popular convolutional neural networks and improve upon other state-of-the-art fine-tuning based k-shot learning strategies by more than10%",0
"Here we propose an extension of K-shot learning: regularized deep networks (KRDN). Our method applies weight decay regularization during each episode to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. KRDN outperforms related work by consistently achieving higher accuracy on benchmark datasets with fewer episodes compared to baseline methods. Additionally, our approach can be further improved using adaptive techniques such as cyclical learning rates. We believe that our proposed method will provide researchers a powerful toolset to study few shot learning problems in computer vision tasks.",1
"Augmenting an agent's control with useful higher-level behaviors called options can greatly reduce the sample complexity of reinforcement learning, but manually designing options is infeasible in high-dimensional and abstract state spaces. While recent work has proposed several techniques for automated option discovery, they do not scale to multi-level hierarchies and to expressive representations such as deep networks. We present Discovery of Deep Options (DDO), a policy-gradient algorithm that discovers parametrized options from a set of demonstration trajectories, and can be used recursively to discover additional levels of the hierarchy. The scalability of our approach to multi-level hierarchies stems from the decoupling of low-level option discovery from high-level meta-control policy learning, facilitated by under-parametrization of the high level. We demonstrate that using the discovered options to augment the action space of Deep Q-Network agents can accelerate learning by guiding exploration in tasks where random actions are unlikely to reach valuable states. We show that DDO is effective in adding options that accelerate learning in 4 out of 5 Atari RAM environments chosen in our experiments. We also show that DDO can discover structure in robot-assisted surgical videos and kinematics that match expert annotation with 72% accuracy.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to discover high-level representations through multiple levels of abstraction. One important challenge that remains, however, is how to automatically find efficient architectures that can efficiently learn these representations.

MLDO is able to perform multi-level discovery by combining different NAS algorithms at each level of abstraction. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets across computer vision tasks such as CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of MLDO for automating the process of finding highly competitive architectures.

"Deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results in learning control policies for complex sequential decision-making tasks. However, these neural network-based policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. This vulnerability poses a potentially serious threat to safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism to defend reinforcement learning agents from adversarial attacks by leveraging an action-conditioned frame prediction module. Our core idea is that the adversarial examples targeting at a neural network-based policy are not effective for the frame prediction model. By comparing the action distribution produced by a policy from processing the current observed frame to the action distribution produced by the same policy from processing the predicted frame from the action-conditioned frame prediction module, we can detect the presence of adversarial examples. Beyond detecting the presence of adversarial examples, our method allows the agent to continue performing the task using the predicted frame when the agent is under attack. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using five games in Atari 2600. Our results demonstrate that the proposed defense mechanism achieves favorable performance against baseline algorithms in detecting adversarial examples and in earning rewards when the agents are under attack.",0
"Neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause them to make incorrect predictions by adding small perturbations to inputs that are imperceptible to humans.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing that it is able to accurately identify and classify adversarial examples with high confidence and low false positive rates. The results provide insights into the behavior of adversarial attacks on deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and could potentially enable new defenses against such attacks.

"Few-shot learning is challenging for learning algorithms that learn each task in isolation and from scratch. In contrast, meta-learning learns from many related tasks a meta-learner that can learn a new task more accurately and faster with fewer examples, where the choice of meta-learners is crucial. In this paper, we develop Meta-SGD, an SGD-like, easily trainable meta-learner that can initialize and adapt any differentiable learner in just one step, on both supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Compared to the popular meta-learner LSTM, Meta-SGD is conceptually simpler, easier to implement, and can be learned more efficiently. Compared to the latest meta-learner MAML, Meta-SGD has a much higher capacity by learning to learn not just the learner initialization, but also the learner update direction and learning rate, all in a single meta-learning process. Meta-SGD shows highly competitive performance for few-shot learning on regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.",0

"We designed a grid world task to study human planning and re-planning behavior in an unknown stochastic environment. In our grid world, participants were asked to travel from a random starting point to a random goal position while maximizing their reward. Because they were not familiar with the environment, they needed to learn its characteristics from experience to plan optimally. Later in the task, we randomly blocked the optimal path to investigate whether and how people adjust their original plans to find a detour. To this end, we developed and compared 12 different models. These models were different on how they learned and represented the environment and how they planned to catch the goal. The majority of our participants were able to plan optimally. We also showed that people were capable of revising their plans when an unexpected event occurred. The result from the model comparison showed that the model-based reinforcement learning approach provided the best account for the data and outperformed heuristics in explaining the behavioral data in the re-planning trials.",0

"Mdp Environments For The Openai Gym The use of model-free deep reinforcement learning (MDP) has become increasingly popular due to its ability to handle complex problems without requiring knowledge of the environment dynamics.

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a vital modeling technique that rely on internal states learned indirectly by optimization of a supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement training loss. RNNs are used to model dynamic processes that are characterized by underlying latent states whose form is often unknown, precluding its analytic representation inside an RNN. In the Predictive-State Representation (PSR) literature, latent state processes are modeled by an internal state representation that directly models the distribution of future observations, and most recent work in this area has relied on explicitly representing and targeting sufficient statistics of this probability distribution. We seek to combine the advantages of RNNs and PSRs by augmenting existing state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks with Predictive-State Decoders (PSDs), which add supervision to the network's internal state representation to target predicting future observations. Predictive-State Decoders are simple to implement and easily incorporated into existing training pipelines via additional loss regularization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PSDs with experimental results in three different domains: probabilistic filtering, Imitation Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. In each, our method improves statistical performance of state-of-the-art recurrent baselines and does so with fewer iterations and less data.",0
"The increasing popularity of deep learning has brought renewed interest in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). One major challenge faced by RNNs is the vanishing gradient problem, which can make training difficult and lead to poor performance on certain tasks.

PSDs provide explicit memory access without relying solely on weight matrices that have large gradients, effectively overcoming the vanishing gradient problem. In our experiments, we found that PSDs achieved significantly better results than traditional RNNs on benchmark datasets such as synthetic stock price prediction, penn treebank sentence generation, and pixel video frame prediction. Our work demonstrates the potential of using predictive-state decoders to improve RNN performance and enable new applications in areas like language processing and computer vision.",1
"We consider the problem of active feature acquisition, where we sequentially select the subset of features in order to achieve the maximum prediction performance in the most cost-effective way. In this work, we formulate this active feature acquisition problem as a reinforcement learning problem, and provide a novel framework for jointly learning both the RL agent and the classifier (environment). We also introduce a more systematic way of encoding subsets of features that can properly handle innate challenge with missing entries in active feature acquisition problems, that uses the orderless LSTM-based set encoding mechanism that readily fits in the joint learning framework. We evaluate our model on a carefully designed synthetic dataset for the active feature acquisition as well as several real datasets such as electric health record (EHR) datasets, on which it outperforms all baselines in terms of prediction performance as well feature acquisition cost.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in feature acquisition methods that can actively learn from human feedback while classifying instances. However, existing approaches typically focus on either active learning or interactive machine learning, rather than both simultaneously. This paper presents a joint framework for active feature acquisition and classification (AFA) that enables efficient interaction between users and models by balancing data quality and user effort. Our approach incorporates two key components: a user model and a decision model. The user model estimates uncertainty levels and task difficulty, allowing our system to select optimal points for seeking user feedback. Meanwhile, the decision model learns from user interactions, dynamically updating its beliefs about which features should receive preference during future rounds of selection. Experiments conducted on real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art alternatives.

"Deep Reinforcement Learning has been able to achieve amazing successes in a variety of domains from video games to continuous control by trying to maximize the cumulative reward. However, most of these successes rely on algorithms that require a large amount of data to train in order to obtain results on par with human-level performance. This is not feasible if we are to deploy these systems on real world tasks and hence there has been an increased thrust in exploring data efficient algorithms. To this end, we propose the Shared Learning framework aimed at making $Q$-ensemble algorithms data-efficient. For achieving this, we look into some principles of transfer learning which aim to study the benefits of information exchange across tasks in reinforcement learning and adapt transfer to learning our value function estimates in a novel manner. In this paper, we consider the special case of transfer between the value function estimates in the $Q$-ensemble architecture of BootstrappedDQN. We further empirically demonstrate how our proposed framework can help in speeding up the learning process in $Q$-ensembles with minimum computational overhead on a suite of Atari 2600 Games.",0
"Abstract: --- $Q$-ensembles have been shown to improve sample efficiency and stability in reinforcement learning (RL).

Empirical results across multiple environments show that our proposed method leads to improved convergence speed and overall RL task performance compared to traditional $Q$-ensembles. Our findings suggest that incorporating shared learning into $Q$-ensembles provides a powerful approach to enhancing reinforcement learning performance.  ------",1
"We consider the problem of learning an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP) that is weakly communicating in the infinite horizon setting. We propose a Thompson Sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm with dynamic episodes (TSDE). At the beginning of each episode, the algorithm generates a sample from the posterior distribution over the unknown model parameters. It then follows the optimal stationary policy for the sampled model for the rest of the episode. The duration of each episode is dynamically determined by two stopping criteria. The first stopping criterion controls the growth rate of episode length. The second stopping criterion happens when the number of visits to any state-action pair is doubled. We establish $\tilde O(HS\sqrt{AT})$ bounds on expected regret under a Bayesian setting, where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces, $T$ is time, and $H$ is the bound of the span. This regret bound matches the best available bound for weakly communicating MDPs. Numerical results show it to perform better than existing algorithms for infinite horizon MDPs.",0
"In many real-world applications, Markov decision processes (MDPs) are unknown or partially known. This means that important information such as transition probabilities, reward functions, or state variables are missing or uncertain. Existing approaches either assume full knowledge of MDP parameters or use Bayesian methods that require prior distributions over those parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called learning unknown Markov decision processes using Thompson sampling.  Thompson sampling is a popular method for sequential decision making under uncertainty that has been shown to perform well in practice. We extend Thompson sampling to handle unknown MDPs by introducing a novel algorithm that learns both the optimal policy and parameter estimates simultaneously through exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. Our approach uses observed trajectories to update the posterior beliefs over transition probabilities, reward functions, and other necessary components of the MDP model.  We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets from healthcare and finance domains. Results show that our proposed method outperforms existing alternatives, including models trained on historical data alone. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis of our approach, including regret bounds and convergence guarantees, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our method in handling complex, high-dimensional MDPs with unknown parameters.

"Visual object tracking is a fundamental and time-critical vision task. Recent years have seen many shallow tracking methods based on real-time pixel-based correlation filters, as well as deep methods that have top performance but need a high-end GPU. In this paper, we learn to improve the speed of deep trackers without losing accuracy. Our fundamental insight is to take an adaptive approach, where easy frames are processed with cheap features (such as pixel values), while challenging frames are processed with invariant but expensive deep features. We formulate the adaptive tracking problem as a decision-making process, and learn an agent to decide whether to locate objects with high confidence on an early layer, or continue processing subsequent layers of a network. This significantly reduces the feed-forward cost for easy frames with distinct or slow-moving objects. We train the agent offline in a reinforcement learning fashion, and further demonstrate that learning all deep layers (so as to provide good features for adaptive tracking) can lead to near real-time average tracking speed of 23 fps on a single CPU while achieving state-of-the-art performance. Perhaps most tellingly, our approach provides a 100X speedup for almost 50% of the time, indicating the power of an adaptive approach.",0
"Incorporate keywords like adaptivity, tracking, deep learning, object detection. This is a sample abstract: Artificial intelligence has made significant advances towards achieving human-level performance on tasks such as image recognition, machine translation, and game playing. One area that remains challenging despite these developments is computer vision. Computer vision requires algorithms to make sense of vast amounts of data, identify patterns from large datasets, process images in real time, and adapt to new environments quickly. To address some of these challenges, we propose the use of deep feature cascades (DFCs) which combine advantages offered by both holistically constructed features and regionally focused processing pipelines. DFCs achieve competitive results compared to traditional sliding window based detectors while drastically reducing computational demands through selective search and dynamic programming formulations. Additionally, our work explores the impact of policy gradient methods on selecting optimal action sequences from among these efficient alternatives in order to perform effective tracking under varying conditions. By combining powerful pattern recognition capabilities enabled by deep neural networks with strategic decision making based on gradient estimates, our framework exhibits excellent tradeoffs between accuracy and speed within complex scenarios requiring adaptive object detection processes. We evaluate DFC systems equipped with learned policies using multiple benchmarks involving both static and moving objects where our model compares favourably against existing state of the art techniques.

"We consider $d$-dimensional linear stochastic approximation algorithms (LSAs) with a constant step-size and the so called Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging of iterates. LSAs are widely applied in machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL), where the aim is to compute an appropriate $\theta_{*} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (that is an optimum or a fixed point) using noisy data and $O(d)$ updates per iteration. In this paper, we are motivated by the problem (in RL) of policy evaluation from experience replay using the \emph{temporal difference} (TD) class of learning algorithms that are also LSAs. For LSAs with a constant step-size, and PR averaging, we provide bounds for the mean squared error (MSE) after $t$ iterations. We assume that data is \iid with finite variance (underlying distribution being $P$) and that the expected dynamics is Hurwitz. For a given LSA with PR averaging, and data distribution $P$ satisfying the said assumptions, we show that there exists a range of constant step-sizes such that its MSE decays as $O(\frac{1}{t})$.   We examine the conditions under which a constant step-size can be chosen uniformly for a class of data distributions $\mathcal{P}$, and show that not all data distributions `admit' such a uniform constant step-size. We also suggest a heuristic step-size tuning algorithm to choose a constant step-size of a given LSA for a given data distribution $P$. We compare our results with related work and also discuss the implication of our results in the context of TD algorithms that are LSAs.",0
"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithms with constant step-size and iterate averaging techniques.

In this work, we investigate two popular schemes for improving the robustness and stability of LSA methods: constant step-size LSA and iterate averaging LSA. We present theoretical results that provide insights into the behavior of these schemes under different conditions and illustrate our findings through numerical experiments on relevant applications. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of constant step-size and iterate averaging methods for enhancing the performance of LSA algorithms in practice.

"We explore the use of Evolution Strategies (ES), a class of black box optimization algorithms, as an alternative to popular MDP-based RL techniques such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made tremendous progress over recent years, largely driven by advancements in machine learning techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL). While RL has been particularly successful at solving complex tasks, most notably in games like chess, Go, and Atari video games, it requires large amounts of data and computing resources that are often impractical for many applications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based optimization used in RL can lead to high computational costs and may struggle to escape from suboptimal solutions. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which have gained attention recently due to their ability to achieve state-of-the art results on certain benchmarks without massive computational requirements, offer a promising alternative solution. We propose ES as a scalable alternative to RL for problems where computational constraints cannot justify the use of current methods based on maximum likelihood policy gradients and offline Monte Carlo rollouts. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach across multiple domains, including gridworld problems, continuous control, vision-based navigation, and even comparisons against a human expert in Chess960. By demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches while utilizing fewer parameters, faster training speeds, and more real-time applicability in simulated robotics scenarios, we support the use of ES as a versatile tool for addressing challenges facing the deployment of safe and reliable AI systems in the real world. Ultimately, ES hold great promise as a powerful general toolkit for optimizing policies in complex environments and decision making under uncertainty beyond gameplay benchmarks. As such, researchers should continue exploring ways",1
"Much combinatorial optimisation problems constitute a non-polynomial (NP) hard optimisation problem, i.e., they can not be solved in polynomial time. One such problem is finding the shortest route between two nodes on a graph. Meta-heuristic algorithms such as $A^{*}$ along with mixed-integer programming (MIP) methods are often employed for these problems. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to approximate solutions generated by a meta-heuristic algorithm using a deep recurrent neural network. We compare different methodologies based on reinforcement learning (RL) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to gauge their respective quality of approximation. We show the viability of recurrent neural network solutions on a graph that has over 300 nodes and argue that a sequence-to-sequence network rather than other recurrent networks has improved approximation quality. Additionally, we argue that homotopy continuation -- that increases chances of hitting an extremum -- further improves the estimate generated by a vanilla RNN.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents HomRecNeuNet, a framework that enables the approximation of complex meta-heuristics using homotopy techniques combined with deep learning. These methods allow the construction of continuous approximations to nonlinear functions without the need for training data, making them suitable for problems where only function evaluations can be obtained. To achieve these goals, we leverage recent advances in numerical continuation methods, which provide powerful tools for studying the local behavior of vector fields defined on smooth manifolds. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HomRecNeuNet in reproducing classic meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing (SA) and evolution strategies (ES), highlighting the potential of our approach to enable new applications across diverse domains including computer vision, robotics, and control systems.",1
"We propose a dynamic computational time model to accelerate the average processing time for recurrent visual attention (RAM). Rather than attention with a fixed number of steps for each input image, the model learns to decide when to stop on the fly. To achieve this, we add an additional continue/stop action per time step to RAM and use reinforcement learning to learn both the optimal attention policy and stopping policy. The modification is simple but could dramatically save the average computational time while keeping the same recognition performance as RAM. Experimental results on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars dataset demonstrate the dynamic computational model can work effectively for fine-grained image recognition.The source code of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/baidu-research/DT-RAM",0
"Title: ""Dynamic Computational Time for Visual Attention""  Abstract:  The ability to allocate computational resources dynamically during visual attention has been shown to improve efficiency and accuracy in artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes dynamic computational time allocation based on visual attention demands. Our method involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller units, each with unique attentional requirements. By allocating more computational power to areas of high interest, our system can efficiently process large volumes of data while minimizing wasted processing cycles. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we conducted experiments using a variety of benchmark datasets and compared them against several state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our approach outperforms traditional static approaches by achieving significant improvements in both speed and accuracy, making it well suited for real-world applications where quick and accurate responses are essential. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential benefits of dynamic resource allocation for improved performance in the field of computer vision.",1
"We present LADDER, the first deep reinforcement learning agent that can successfully learn control policies for large-scale real-world problems directly from raw inputs composed of high-level semantic information. The agent is based on an asynchronous stochastic variant of DQN (Deep Q Network) named DASQN. The inputs of the agent are plain-text descriptions of states of a game of incomplete information, i.e. real-time large scale online auctions, and the rewards are auction profits of very large scale. We apply the agent to an essential portion of JD's online RTB (real-time bidding) advertising business and find that it easily beats the former state-of-the-art bidding policy that had been carefully engineered and calibrated by human experts: during JD.com's June 18th anniversary sale, the agent increased the company's ads revenue from the portion by more than 50%, while the advertisers' ROI (return on investment) also improved significantly.",0
"In the world of online auctions, large scale real-time bidding has become increasingly important as the volume of data available continues to grow at exponential rates. However, these systems often rely on simple heuristics that lack human intelligence and decision making abilities. To address this gap, we present our approach to developing a new methodology, called LADDER (Learned Approach for Dynamic Decision Making in Real-Time Bidding Environments), which uses machine learning algorithms to learn from historical bid data and adapts to changing conditions in real time. Our system outperforms traditional heuristics by incorporating feedback loops and attention mechanisms inspired by human decision-making processes. By combining multiple sources of information including ad metadata, contextual features, and user engagement metrics, our model achieves state-of-the art performance in terms of win rate, cost per acquisition, and return on investment. We evaluate our methodology through experiments using publicly available datasets and showcase significant improvements over strong baseline models. Overall, our work provides evidence that learned methods can significantly improve upon existing techniques used for online advertising bidding.",1
"Generating molecules with desired chemical properties is important for drug discovery. The use of generative neural networks is promising for this task. However, from visual inspection, it often appears that generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we quantify this internal chemical diversity, and we raise the following challenge: can a nontrivial AI model reproduce natural chemical diversity for desired molecules? To illustrate this question, we consider two generative models: a Reinforcement Learning model and the recently introduced ORGAN. Both fail at this challenge. We hope this challenge will stimulate research in this direction.",0
"Abstract: The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data that accurately represents real-world phenomena has been well established across many domains. In the field of chemistry, GANs have proven to be particularly effective at generating novel molecules that mimic natural structures. However, whether these synthesized compounds truly capture all aspects of natural chemical diversity remains unknown. In our paper, we present the results of a challenging evaluation designed to assess the capacity of GAN-based tools to create highly diverse and representative compound sets comparable to those found in nature. Our findings suggest that while current AI methods show promising potential, there remain significant limitations in their ability to reproduce the full extent of natural chemical variation, highlighting areas where further research and development are necessary. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the capabilities and shortcomings of AI techniques in drug discovery, helping guide future efforts towards more accurate and efficient synthesis of novel pharmacological agents.",1
"We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a ""surrogate"" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to policy optimization that takes advantage of recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called proximal policy optimization (PPO), combines several desirable properties such as efficiency, robustness, scalability, and ease of implementation into one simple algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO on a range of challenging continuous control tasks, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis and insights that explain why our algorithm works well and under which conditions it is most effective. Overall, our work provides important contributions to the field by introducing a new algorithm that has broad applications in many domains where Reinforcement Learning agents need to make decisions based on rewards received from their environment.",1
"As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.",0
"Deep generative models have shown great successes in generating coherent sequences across many domains, such as images, speech signals, and texts. However, due to their high dimensionality, training them remains challenging even on recent large hardware resources. In this work we introduce a sequence generator that combines generative adversarial networks (GANs) with actor critic reinforcement learning methods trained via policy gradients. We show how this system can generate both natural language text and speech like human speakers using significantly fewer parameters than previous works, while achieving competitive results. By reducing model size, inference time, and memory requirements our method becomes more widely deployable.",1
"In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and portable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However, data for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online learning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides, we find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and connected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic RL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method in all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective policies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm start trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization of our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised learning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related tasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that in a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"This works handles the inverse reinforcement learning problem in high-dimensional state spaces, which relies on an efficient solution of model-based high-dimensional reinforcement learning problems. To solve the computationally expensive reinforcement learning problems, we propose a function approximation method to ensure that the Bellman Optimality Equation always holds, and then estimate a function based on the observed human actions for inverse reinforcement learning problems. The time complexity of the proposed method is linearly proportional to the cardinality of the action set, thus it can handle high-dimensional even continuous state spaces efficiently. We test the proposed method in a simulated environment to show its accuracy, and three clinical tasks to show how it can be used to evaluate a doctor's proficiency.",0
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for model-based inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) that improves upon existing approaches by using function approximation techniques. IRL involves inferring an agent’s reward function from observations of their behavior in an environment. Traditional methods use linear regression techniques and suffer from limitations such as poor scalability to high dimensional spaces and sensitivity to outliers. Our approach uses nonlinear kernel density estimation combined with Gaussian processes to learn smooth approximations of the value functions underlying the observed behavior. Experiments on benchmark environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. We further discuss applications of our technique in autonomous driving scenarios where understanding human driving behavior could provide valuable insights into safe interactions with other road users.,1
"We introduce a general framework for visual forecasting, which directly imitates visual sequences without additional supervision. As a result, our model can be applied at several semantic levels and does not require any domain knowledge or handcrafted features. We achieve this by formulating visual forecasting as an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, and directly imitate the dynamics in natural sequences from their raw pixel values. The key challenge is the high-dimensional and continuous state-action space that prohibits the application of previous IRL algorithms. We address this computational bottleneck by extending recent progress in model-free imitation with trainable deep feature representations, which (1) bypasses the exhaustive state-action pair visits in dynamic programming by using a dual formulation and (2) avoids explicit state sampling at gradient computation using a deep feature reparametrization. This allows us to apply IRL at scale and directly imitate the dynamics in high-dimensional continuous visual sequences from the raw pixel values. We evaluate our approach at three different level-of-abstraction, from low level pixels to higher level semantics: future frame generation, action anticipation, visual story forecasting. At all levels, our approach outperforms existing methods.",0

Present findings modestly but accurately highlighting any contributions your research makes compared to other work done on similar topics. Keep sentence structure uniform throughout the abstract by using present participles, gerunds or passive voice constructions where appropriate. Visual forecasting has become increasingly important in recent years due to the explosion of data available in visual media formats such as images and videos. As human consumption shifts towards digital platforms, there has been growing interest in automating processes that were once carried out manually by humans. This includes tasks like image classification and object detection, which have significant applications across many industries including healthcare, finance, retail, security, and entertainment. One key challenge associated with these tasks is the ability to make accurate predictions into the future based on past observations of natural sequences. In order to overcome this barrier, we propose a novel approach that utilizes deep learning techniques to imitate the dynamics observed in natural sequences. Our method involves training neural networks on large datasets consisting of millions of examples. By leveraging advances in computer vision algorithms and GPU computing power, our models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for both video prediction and image generation tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how our framework can be applied to challenges such as action recognition, anomaly detection, and unsupervised representation learning. Overall, our work presents a promising direction for improving the efficiency and accuracy of visual forecasting systems in various domains.",1
"In this work, we propose to apply trust region optimization to deep reinforcement learning using a recently proposed Kronecker-factored approximation to the curvature. We extend the framework of natural policy gradient and propose to optimize both the actor and the critic using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) with trust region; hence we call our method Actor Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region (ACKTR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable trust region natural gradient method for actor-critic methods. It is also a method that learns non-trivial tasks in continuous control as well as discrete control policies directly from raw pixel inputs. We tested our approach across discrete domains in Atari games as well as continuous domains in the MuJoCo environment. With the proposed methods, we are able to achieve higher rewards and a 2- to 3-fold improvement in sample efficiency on average, compared to previous state-of-the-art on-policy actor-critic methods.

"When encountering novel objects, humans are able to infer a wide range of physical properties such as mass, friction and deformability by interacting with them in a goal driven way. This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.",0

"This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a reinforcement learning environment based on the StarCraft II game. This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress.

"A crucial capability of real-world intelligent agents is their ability to plan a sequence of actions to achieve their goals in the visual world. In this work, we address the problem of visual semantic planning: the task of predicting a sequence of actions from visual observations that transform a dynamic environment from an initial state to a goal state. Doing so entails knowledge about objects and their affordances, as well as actions and their preconditions and effects. We propose learning these through interacting with a visual and dynamic environment. Our proposed solution involves bootstrapping reinforcement learning with imitation learning. To ensure cross task generalization, we develop a deep predictive model based on successor representations. Our experimental results show near optimal results across a wide range of tasks in the challenging THOR environment.",0
"Incorporating prior knowledge into planning can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of planning algorithms by reducing the search space and guiding the planner towards more probable plans. This paper presents a novel approach that uses deep learning techniques to generate semantic successor representations (SSRs) from raw perceptual inputs such as images. These SSRs encode high-level concepts of scenes in a compact and interpretable manner, allowing them to serve as meaningful input for downstream applications like planning. The proposed method leverages state-of-the-art computer vision models pre-trained on large datasets to extract features from visual input, which are then encoded into a low dimensional latent space using an autoencoder. To handle uncertainty inherent in sensor measurements and the learning process itself, we propose a probabilistic framework where each SSR is represented as a distribution over discrete states corresponding to different possible interpretations. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark domains: GridWorld, Habitat, and VLN (Visual Language Navigation). Experimental results show that incorporating our learned SSRs leads to significant improvements over standard methods in both domain randomization and fine-tuning settings. Additionally, qualitative analysis demonstrates the interpretability and robustness of generated SSR distributions across multiple tasks and environments. Our work contributes to the broader field of combining machine learning and planning, paving the way for developing powerful agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in complex real-world scenarios.",1

Based on this correspondence, a scheme to learn importance while sampling path space is derived. The new approach is demonstrated in a consistent light transport simulation algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to progressively learn where light comes from. As using this information for importance sampling includes information about visibility, too, the number of light transport paths with zero contribution is dramatically reduced, resulting in much less noisy images within a fixed time budget.",0
"In this paper we present a novel method for learning parameters controlling light transport through complex scenes using deep reinforcement learning techniques.

"Due to the popularity of smartphones and wearable devices nowadays, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are promising to bring positive and wide impacts on people's health. State-of-the-art decision-making methods for mHealth rely on some ideal assumptions. Those methods either assume that the users are completely homogenous or completely heterogeneous. However, in reality, a user might be similar with some, but not all, users. In this paper, we propose a novel group-driven reinforcement learning method for the mHealth. We aim to understand how to share information among similar users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned RL policies.

We test the proposed method in a simulated environment, and show that it is more accurate than existing methods and significantly better in scalability. We also show that the proposed method can extend many existing methods to high-dimensional state spaces. We then apply the method to evaluating the effect of rehabilitative stimulations on patients with spinal cord injuries based on the observed patient motions.",0
"Abstract: Recent advances have allowed inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) agents to operate efficiently and effectively across large state spaces by using function approximation techniques such as linear regression, neural networks, decision trees, etc. However, these methods typically require a very detailed model of both the environment’s dynamics and the reward structure which can be quite challenging and time consuming. As a result, there has been significant interest in developing new approaches that utilize more powerful representations, data, models, architectures and algorithms. Specifically, there have been efforts to develop IRL algorithms that are able to handle larger state spaces without sacrificing accuracy and efficiency. Our approach focuses on optimizing the choice of features and weights used in function approximators while maintaining interpretability and scalability. Our proposed method leverages recent progress in deep learning and natural language processing to represent high dimensional observations. We demonstrate empirically on several benchmark problems that our algorithm outperforms existing baseline methods even when they use exact feature mappings. Additionally, we show how our methodology naturally applies to real world domains where raw sensor inputs must be processed before providing any meaningful feedback. Overall, our contributions aim at bridging the gap between theory and practice in the development of advanced robotic systems capable of operating autonomously in complex environments under partial observability.",1
"Despite the substantial progress in recent years, the image captioning techniques are still far from being perfect.Sentences produced by existing methods, e.g. those based on RNNs, are often overly rigid and lacking in variability. This issue is related to a learning principle widely used in practice, that is, to maximize the likelihood of training samples. This principle encourages high resemblance to the ""ground-truth"" captions while suppressing other reasonable descriptions. Conventional evaluation metrics, e.g. BLEU and METEOR, also favor such restrictive methods. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach, with the aim to improve the naturalness and diversity -- two essential properties of human expression. Specifically, we propose a new framework based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), which jointly learns a generator to produce descriptions conditioned on images and an evaluator to assess how well a description fits the visual content. It is noteworthy that training a sequence generator is nontrivial. We overcome the difficulty by Policy Gradient, a strategy stemming from Reinforcement Learning, which allows the generator to receive early feedback along the way. We tested our method on two large datasets, where it performed competitively against real people in our user study and outperformed other methods on various tasks.",0
"In this work, we present a novel approach towards generating diverse and natural image descriptions using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Our model effectively leverages cGANs to generate accurate and descriptive textual representations of images by conditioning on external features such as object labels or semantic attributes. To achieve more diversity in generated descriptions, our method incorporates random noise into the generator input at training time. This ensures that the model generates multiple distinct descriptions even for identical inputs. Moreover, we use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fine-tune the model by optimizing a reward function based on the quality of generated descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluations. Our approach has potential applications in computer vision tasks such as scene understanding and visual question answering.",1
"Policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning have become increasingly prevalent for state-of-the-art performance in continuous control tasks. Novel methods typically benchmark against a few key algorithms such as deep deterministic policy gradients and trust region policy optimization. As such, it is important to present and use consistent baselines experiments. However, this can be difficult due to general variance in the algorithms, hyper-parameter tuning, and environment stochasticity. We investigate and discuss: the significance of hyper-parameters in policy gradients for continuous control, general variance in the algorithms, and reproducibility of reported results. We provide guidelines on reporting novel results as comparisons against baseline methods such that future researchers can make informed decisions when investigating novel methods.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex control tasks in a variety of domains, from robotics to computer graphics.

This paper addresses that issue by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the reproducibility of DRL methods on continuous control tasks using popular open-source benchmark suites. We found that despite some issues with implementation details, many state-of-the-art algorithms were able to achieve high levels of performance on these tasks, suggesting that DRL has indeed made significant progress towards solving challenging real-world problems. Our study highlights the importance of proper documentation and sharing of code and data for facilitating future research in the field. Overall, we believe our findings provide valuable insights into the current state of DRL and offer guidance for future efforts aimed at improving reproducibility and advancing the field.",1
"Face hallucination is a domain-specific super-resolution problem with the goal to generate high-resolution (HR) faces from low-resolution (LR) input images. In contrast to existing methods that often learn a single patch-to-patch mapping from LR to HR images and are regardless of the contextual interdependency between patches, we propose a novel Attention-aware Face Hallucination (Attention-FH) framework which resorts to deep reinforcement learning for sequentially discovering attended patches and then performing the facial part enhancement by fully exploiting the global interdependency of the image. Specifically, in each time step, the recurrent policy network is proposed to dynamically specify a new attended region by incorporating what happened in the past. The state (i.e., face hallucination result for the whole image) can thus be exploited and updated by the local enhancement network on the selected region. The Attention-FH approach jointly learns the recurrent policy network and local enhancement network through maximizing the long-term reward that reflects the hallucination performance over the whole image. Therefore, our proposed Attention-FH is capable of adaptively personalizing an optimal searching path for each face image according to its own characteristic. Extensive experiments show our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-arts on in-the-wild faces with large pose and illumination variations.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized many areas of computer vision, including face hallucination, which refers to generating high resolution facial images from low resolution input. Traditional methods for face hallucination often rely on handcrafted features and predefined priors that may fail to capture important aspects of face images. To address these limitations, we propose an attention-aware approach based on reinforcement learning (RL) that captures salient facial details without relying on explicit regularization terms.  Our method consists of two key components: an encoder network that maps the low-resolution input to a compressed representation and a decoder network that generates the corresponding high-resolution output through iterative refinement steps guided by RL. Specifically, at each iteration step, the agent learns to selectively focus on the most relevant regions of the face image, as measured by its attentional weighting, while minimizing reconstruction errors using policy gradient optimization.  We evaluate our model across several benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that the proposed framework effectively enhances visual quality, preserves intrinsic features, and produces plausible hallucinations even under challenging conditions such as large scale factors and noise. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the importance of incorporating attention mechanisms into the deep neural networks during training, enabling robust generalization and reducing the risk of overfitting.  In summary, our study represents a significant advance towards efficient face hallucination by harnessing powerful deep learning techniques that can adaptively attend to semantically meaningful cues within the face space. With its strong empirical validity and simplicity of implementation, our work promises exciting opportunities for real-world applications ranging from computer graphics animation to video surveillance and biometrics security systems.",1
"In this paper we study how to learn stochastic, multimodal transition dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. We focus on evaluating transition function estimation, while we defer planning over this model to future work. Stochasticity is a fundamental property of many task environments. However, discriminative function approximators have difficulty estimating multimodal stochasticity. In contrast, deep generative models do capture complex high-dimensional outcome distributions. First we discuss why, amongst such models, conditional variational inference (VI) is theoretically most appealing for model-based RL. Subsequently, we compare different VI models on their ability to learn complex stochasticity on simulated functions, as well as on a typical RL gridworld with multimodal dynamics. Results show VI successfully predicts multimodal outcomes, but also robustly ignores these for deterministic parts of the transition dynamics. In summary, we show a robust method to learn multimodal transitions using function approximation, which is a key preliminary for model-based RL in stochastic domains.",0
"In recent years, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has emerged as a promising approach for achieving high performance in complex sequential decision making tasks. However, MBRL requires accurate models of both state transition dynamics and reward functions to achieve good performance. While there have been significant advances in learning accurate state transition dynamics using multi-modal sensor data, existing methods struggle to capture the multimodality present in real world systems which leads to suboptimal policies. This paper introduces a novel algorithm called MTDDM that learns multimodal transition dynamics by jointly optimizing all relevant sensor modalities, including both image and LiDAR point cloud data from self-driving cars. Our results demonstrate substantial improvement over previous approaches on benchmark driving datasets while running at real time speeds. Furthermore, we provide insight into how our approach works and suggest future directions for research in this area.",1
"We tackle the problem of learning robotic sensorimotor control policies that can generalize to visually diverse and unseen environments. Achieving broad generalization typically requires large datasets, which are difficult to obtain for task-specific interactive processes such as reinforcement learning or learning from demonstration. However, much of the visual diversity in the world can be captured through passively collected datasets of images or videos. In our method, which we refer to as GPLAC (Generalized Policy Learning with Attentional Classifier), we use both interaction data and weakly labeled image data to augment the generalization capacity of sensorimotor policies. Our method combines multitask learning on action selection and an auxiliary binary classification objective, together with a convolutional neural network architecture that uses an attentional mechanism to avoid distractors. We show that pairing interaction data from just a single environment with a diverse dataset of weakly labeled data results in greatly improved generalization to unseen environments, and show that this generalization depends on both the auxiliary objective and the attentional architecture that we propose. We demonstrate our results in both simulation and on a real robotic manipulator, and demonstrate substantial improvement over standard convolutional architectures and domain adaptation methods.",0
"In recent years, robotic manipulation has received significant attention due to advancements in both perception and control techniques. To achieve high performance, robots must possess generalizable skills that can adapt to different scenarios and objects. Traditionally, these skills are learned through extensive supervised training on fully labeled images. However, acquiring large amounts of such data can be expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, we propose GPLAC (Generalized Policy Learning from Assisted Corrections), which employs weakly labeled images for learning robotic grasping and manipulation tasks. Our framework first trains a policy through reinforcement learning with demonstration (RLwD) by self-supervising grasp selection based on object detection scores. Then, it utilizes human feedback via click corrections to incrementally refine the policy while minimizing user effort. Experimental results on both simulation and real-world environments show that our method significantly outperforms prior RLwD methods and achieves comparable success compared to those trained with fully supervised data. Furthermore, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each component within our approach. This work paves the way toward enabling robots to learn complex manipulation tasks more efficiently without requiring vast amounts of expert-labeled data.  Abstract: Robotics researchers have made significant progress in improving robots' ability to manipulate objects in recent years, thanks to advances in perception and control techniques. While some previous approaches focused on task-specific solutions, there is now greater emphasis on developing generalizable robotic skills that can adapt to different scenarios and objects.

"We address the problem of incrementally modeling and forecasting long-term goals of a first-person camera wearer: what the user will do, where they will go, and what goal they seek. In contrast to prior work in trajectory forecasting, our algorithm, DARKO, goes further to reason about semantic states (will I pick up an object?), and future goal states that are far in terms of both space and time. DARKO learns and forecasts from first-person visual observations of the user's daily behaviors via an Online Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) approach. Classical IRL discovers only the rewards in a batch setting, whereas DARKO discovers the states, transitions, rewards, and goals of a user from streaming data. Among other results, we show DARKO forecasts goals better than competing methods in both noisy and ideal settings, and our approach is theoretically and empirically no-regret.",0
"In this work, we present a novel approach to first-person activity forecasting using online inverse reinforcement learning (RIL). Our method leverages the idea that humans can learn new skills by observing others perform those same tasks. We model this behavior as a human performing an action while simultaneously generating a sequence of instructions that they would need to follow if they were trying to learn how to achieve the same goal without prior knowledge. This allows us to predict the next most likely action given any current state, regardless of whether or not the agent has previously experienced that particular situation before. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three different datasets: one focused on household activities, another on cooking recipes, and finally on autonomous driving scenarios. Across all three domains, we achieved significant improvements over baseline models and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach at producing accurate predictions of future actions. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards developing intelligent agents capable of acquiring complex real-world skills through natural observation alone.",1
"We initiate the study of fairness in reinforcement learning, where the actions of a learning algorithm may affect its environment and future rewards. Our fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never prefers one action over another if the long-term (discounted) reward of choosing the latter action is higher. Our first result is negative: despite the fact that fairness is consistent with the optimal policy, any learning algorithm satisfying fairness must take time exponential in the number of states to achieve non-trivial approximation to the optimal policy. We then provide a provably fair polynomial time algorithm under an approximate notion of fairness, thus establishing an exponential gap between exact and approximate fairness",0
"Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training agents to make decisions in complex environments. However, ensuring fairness in RL remains a challenge due to the lack of transparency and interpretability in decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose methods to evaluate and promote fairness in RL algorithms by considering distributional criteria that can account for different groups within society. We present case studies on both simulated environments and real-world applications to demonstrate how these criteria can lead to more equitable outcomes across populations. Our work contributes to the broader discussion on ethics and social responsibility in artificial intelligence, and provides insights into designing fairer RL systems.",1
"Given a textual description of an image, phrase grounding localizes objects in the image referred by query phrases in the description. State-of-the-art methods address the problem by ranking a set of proposals based on the relevance to each query, which are limited by the performance of independent proposal generation systems and ignore useful cues from context in the description. In this paper, we adopt a spatial regression method to break the performance limit, and introduce reinforcement learning techniques to further leverage semantic context information. We propose a novel Query-guided Regression network with Context policy (QRC Net) which jointly learns a Proposal Generation Network (PGN), a Query-guided Regression Network (QRN) and a Context Policy Network (CPN). Experiments show QRC Net provides a significant improvement in accuracy on two popular datasets: Flickr30K Entities and Referit Game, with 14.25% and 17.14% increase over the state-of-the-arts respectively.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as phrase grounding, which involves identifying entities mentioned in text that correspond to real world objects. One approach to addressing this challenge is through query guided regression networks, wherein input queries guide the network towards relevant concepts by providing contextual guidance during training and inference. This research proposes a new architecture based on query-guided regression networks called ""context policy"" which improves upon existing models by using learned probability distributions over possible answers rather than relying exclusively on maximum likelihood estimation. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in performance across multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed model. Overall, these results have important implications for future work in NLP and machine learning more broadly, highlighting the potential benefits of incorporating uncertainty into deep neural networks.",1
"High-dimensional representations, such as radial basis function networks or tile coding, are common choices for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. Learning with such high-dimensional representations, however, can be expensive, particularly for matrix methods, such as least-squares temporal difference learning or quasi-Newton methods that approximate matrix step-sizes. In this work, we explore the utility of sketching for these two classes of algorithms. We highlight issues with sketching the high-dimensional features directly, which can incur significant bias. As a remedy, we demonstrate how to use sketching more sparingly, with only a left-sided sketch, that can still enable significant computational gains and the use of these matrix-based learning algorithms that are less sensitive to parameters. We empirically investigate these algorithms, in four domains with a variety of representations. Our aim is to provide insights into effective use of sketching in practice.",0
"Value function approximation plays a crucial role in many reinforcement learning algorithms as the policy improvement depends on accurate estimation of state values. Sketching methods have recently emerged as effective alternatives to existing model-based and Monte Carlo-based approximations by leveraging random projections for both reducing computational cost and improving statistical efficiency. This paper presents new efficient algorithms tailored specifically for discrete actions and continuous statespaces that enable approximate dynamic programming methods like policy iteration, value iteration, and Q-iteration. The proposed sketching method can exploit structural properties like linearity, low rankness, and bellman completeness under mild conditions. Our experimental results confirm that our method can significantly reduce computation time while maintaining accuracy compared to popular baselines. We showcase how our approach applies broadly across diverse domains such as finance, robotics, game theory, healthcare, and energy systems. Therefore, the main contributions herein enhance the understanding, design, analysis, evaluation, and utilization of efficient sketching techniques for optimal decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Wireless systems perform rate adaptation to transmit at highest possible instantaneous rates. Rate adaptation has been increasingly granular over generations of wireless systems. The base-station uses SINR and packet decode feedback called acknowledgement/no acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) to perform rate adaptation. SINR is used for rate anchoring called inner look adaptation and ACK/NACK is used for fine offset adjustments called Outer Loop Link Adaptation (OLLA). We cast the OLLA as a reinforcement learning problem of the class of Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) where the different offset values are the arms of the bandit. In OLLA, as the offset values increase, the probability of packet error also increase, and every user equipment (UE) has a desired Block Error Rate (BLER) to meet certain Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. For this MAB we propose a binary search based algorithm which achieves a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) solution making use of bounds from large deviation theory and confidence bounds. In addition to this we also discuss how a Thompson sampling or UCB based method will not help us meet the target objectives. Finally, simulation results are provided on an LTE system simulator and thereby prove the efficacy of our proposed algorithm.",0
"In this paper we propose two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that enhance outer loop link adaptation performance in 4G/5G systems: QLRA (Q-learning with Rolling Horizon based on Lower confidence bounds) and MSVQLB (Model-free SARSA with Variance Reduced Learning Rate). These schemes aim at improving system throughput by adjusting mobile station transmission power, based on channel quality feedback provided from the Base Station (BS), which could significantly impact overall network efficiency. Our simulations prove their effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as OLLA (Outer Loop Link Adaptation) and ARM (Adaptive Resource Management) in realistic environments across diverse scenarios, while guaranteeing stability, convergence and robustness to changes in user mobility patterns and traffic intensity, thus enhancing user satisfaction and reducing operational costs. By providing new methodologies applicable to both 4G and emerging 5G architectures, these studies extend our understanding of how to optimize resource allocation under different channel conditions towards the goal of achieving ubiquitous high speed connectivity while ensuring low latency and reliability. They further promote green communication technologies in response to society’s increasing concern over climate change, since energy efficient networks translate into significant carbon footprint reduction. Overall, these results contribute to advancing knowledge around intelligent radio resource management (IRRM), lay groundwork for future development of machine intelligence tools within IRRM design space and pave the road towards creating sustainable intelligent wireless infrastructures empowered by artificial intelligence.

"We develop an approach to training generative models based on unrolling a variational auto-encoder into a Markov chain, and shaping the chain's trajectories using a technique inspired by recent work in Approximate Bayesian computation. We show that the global minimizer of the resulting objective is achieved when the generative model reproduces the target distribution. To allow finer control over the behavior of the models, we add a regularization term inspired by techniques used for regularizing certain types of policy search in reinforcement learning. We present empirical results on the MNIST and TFD datasets which show that our approach offers state-of-the-art performance, both quantitatively and from a qualitative point of view.",0
"In our work we present a new kind of generative neural network model that combines variational Bayesian inference with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGLD). By using collaborative shaping constraints on intermediate layers we enforce structured representations that better match human intuition than models trained only to optimize log likelihood. We find improved performance compared to competing methods across several tasks and datasets. Finally, we show that the flexibility introduced by variational approximations can significantly reduce the amount of training data required while improving predictive accuracy compared to classical non-Bayesian alternatives. Overall, the combination of these ideas leads to state-of-the-art results and provides researchers with a powerful tool for generating coherent sequences of symbols. These sequences could represent text paragraphs, images, molecules, genomes, music, etc., making potential applications far reaching.",1
"The Particle Swarm Optimization Policy (PSO-P) has been recently introduced and proven to produce remarkable results on interacting with academic reinforcement learning benchmarks in an off-policy, batch-based setting. To further investigate the properties and feasibility on real-world applications, this paper investigates PSO-P on the so-called Industrial Benchmark (IB), a novel reinforcement learning (RL) benchmark that aims at being realistic by including a variety of aspects found in industrial applications, like continuous state and action spaces, a high dimensional, partially observable state space, delayed effects, and complex stochasticity. The experimental results of PSO-P on IB are compared to results of closed-form control policies derived from the model-based Recurrent Control Neural Network (RCNN) and the model-free Neural Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQ). Experiments show that PSO-P is not only of interest for academic benchmarks, but also for real-world industrial applications, since it also yielded the best performing policy in our IB setting. Compared to other well established RL techniques, PSO-P produced outstanding results in performance and robustness, requiring only a relatively low amount of effort in finding adequate parameters or making complex design decisions.",0

By presenting these first experiences with batch RL on real-world datasets, we aim to encourage further research and discussion in the community.",1
"When an agent cannot represent a perfectly accurate model of its environment's dynamics, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) can fail catastrophically. Planning involves composing the predictions of the model; when flawed predictions are composed, even minor errors can compound and render the model useless for planning. Hallucinated Replay (Talvitie 2014) trains the model to ""correct"" itself when it produces errors, substantially improving MBRL with flawed models. This paper theoretically analyzes this approach, illuminates settings in which it is likely to be effective or ineffective, and presents a novel error bound, showing that a model's ability to self-correct is more tightly related to MBRL performance than one-step prediction error. These results inspire an MBRL algorithm for deterministic MDPs with performance guarantees that are robust to model class limitations.",0
"This paper describes how machine learning models can correct their own errors using model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. By leveraging these self-corrective capabilities, agents trained via model-based RL may achieve higher levels of accuracy without requiring significant changes to their underlying architecture. As such, our findings have important implications for a variety of domains where data efficiency is critical, including robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, and more. We evaluate our approach on several challenging benchmark tasks and demonstrate that it leads to marked improvements over baseline methods across all environments. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into why self-correction matters for RL by connecting it with generalization gaps, which have been well studied in supervised learning but whose importance has only recently been recognized in RL contexts. Finally, we discuss promising future directions arising from our work and consider open questions ripe for further investigation. Overall, our results showcase the potential benefits of integrating self-correction mechanisms into deep learning systems with complex environments, thus enabling efficient, flexible, and effective exploration strategies capable of achieving top performance.",1
"This paper considers a demand response agent that must find a near-optimal sequence of decisions based on sparse observations of its environment. Extracting a relevant set of features from these observations is a challenging task and may require substantial domain knowledge. One way to tackle this problem is to store sequences of past observations and actions in the state vector, making it high dimensional, and apply techniques from deep learning. This paper investigates the capabilities of different deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, to extract relevant features for finding near-optimal policies for a residential heating system and electric water heater that are hindered by sparse observations. Our simulation results indicate that in this specific scenario, feeding sequences of time-series to an LSTM network, which is a specific type of recurrent neural network, achieved a higher performance than stacking these time-series in the input of a convolutional neural network or deep neural network.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using advanced machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the performance of electricity grid systems. One key challenge facing these efforts is that many grid devices, particularly thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), lack sensors and thus provide only limited observability into their behavior. This paper presents an approach based on DRL called direct load control of TCLs (DLCTL) which can make use of sparse observations from individual devices to optimally manage their energy consumption while maintaining user comfort levels. Our method makes three key contributions: Firstly, we develop an algorithmic framework capable of incorporating both real-time pricing signals and historical demand patterns in order to effectively guide decision making at each device level. Secondly, we design a reward mechanism specifically tailored towards TCLs that balances user satisfaction and system efficiency objectives. Finally, we introduce novel model selection procedures to ensure scalability and adaptivity across different network topologies and parameter settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our DLCTL approach outperforms conventional methods by reducing up to 24% peak load while minimizing uncomfortable temperature excursions over diverse test cases. Overall, the findings indicate that DRL has significant potential in enabling intelligent management of smart grids with limited sensor availability through direct load control strategies.",1
"This paper develops an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm aimed at recovering a reward function from the observed actions of an agent. We introduce a strategy to flexibly handle different types of actions with two approximations of the Bellman Optimality Equation, and a Bellman Gradient Iteration method to compute the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the reward function. These methods allow us to build a differentiable relation between the Q-value and the reward function and learn an approximately optimal reward function with gradient methods. We test the proposed method in two simulated environments by evaluating the accuracy of different approximations and comparing the proposed method with existing solutions. The results show that even with a linear reward function, the proposed method has a comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art method adopting a non-linear reward function, and the proposed method is more flexible because it is defined on observed actions instead of trajectories.",0
"Gradient iteration has emerged as a popular method for solving inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problems, where the goal is to recover the reward function that generated a set of observed behavior trajectories. One well-known gradient iterative method is the trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm, which updates policies by maximizing expected improvement of their performance measures using local quadratic approximations of their objective functions. However, TRPO only guarantees monotonic improvements in policy quality if certain conditions on the problem setup hold, such as Lipschitz continuity of reward gradients, which may not always be satisfied in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new iterative method based on the idea of ""Bellman operators,"" which represent the effect of taking one step of a greedy policy improvement update given a fixed reward function. By applying multiple layers of Bellman operator iterations, followed by linearized policy parameter updates and Armijo line search steps, our proposed method ensures global convergence to optimal solutions for IRL problems under mild assumptions on the smoothness of reward functions and the compactness of state spaces. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.",1
"We propose a method for learning expressive energy-based policies for continuous states and actions, which has been feasible only in tabular domains before. We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actor-critic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.",0
"This paper develops methods that learn deep energy-based policies directly from sensorimotor experience, without relying on handcrafted reward functions, value functions, inverse models, or other forms of supervision. Our approach casts policy learning as inference within deep neural networks whose parameters take the form of energies, defined over state and action pairs. We show how these energies can be derived in principled ways from either optimal control theory or variational Bayesian frameworks, enabling us to capture rich structure beyond simple Q functions. In order to actually fit these deep energy-based policies (DEPOL) in practice using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we develop novel gradient estimators based on automatic differentiation through dynamic programming, which exploit both high-level task abstraction and low-level motor details as they naturally occur during execution. With DEPOL and our optimization schemes, agents bootstrapped by nothing but pixels and raw sensors achieve good performance across multiple challenging continuous-control tasks. Notably, we obtain improved results compared to prior work employing powerful model-free RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and data augmentation techniques; however, our architectures are generally less complex than those used in stateof-theart approaches requiring substantial amounts of human design. Code accompanying this manuscript enables reproducibility experiments for several of our scenarios: OpenAI Gym benchmarks Hopper, Walker2D, and HalfCheetah, along with Acrobot, Ant, and LunarLander from the DeepMind Control Suite.

"In this paper we argue for the fundamental importance of the value distribution: the distribution of the random return received by a reinforcement learning agent. This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement learning which models the expectation of this return, or value. Although there is an established body of literature studying the value distribution, thus far it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical evidence to highlight the ways in which the value distribution impacts learning in the approximate setting.",0
"Recent advances have demonstrated that modeling higher-order moments of the return distribution can significantly improve policy evaluation and optimization in reinforcement learning (RL). Motivated by these findings, we present a new algorithm called Higher Order Policy Iteration (HOPI), which approximates the expected KL divergence between the policies at each iteration. Our approach allows us to directly optimize the shape of both the mean policy improvement curve and the variance reduction rate as functions of time step. We show that HOPI outperforms state-of-the-art actor-critic methods such as TD(lambda) and SAC on challenging continuous control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite. Our results suggest that the incorporation of high order statistics in RL algorithms provides significant improvements over traditional approaches based on first moment analysis.",1
"Semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds is an important research topic in computer vision and remote sensing fields. Most existing approaches utilize hand-crafted features for each modality independently and combine them in a heuristic manner. They often fail to consider the consistency and complementary information among features adequately, which makes them difficult to capture high-level semantic structures. The features learned by most of the current deep learning methods can obtain high-quality image classification results. However, these methods are hard to be applied to recognize 3D point clouds due to unorganized distribution and various point density of data. In this paper, we propose a 3DCNN-DQN-RNN method which fuses the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Residual recurrent neural network (RNN) for an efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds. In our method, an eye window under control of the 3D CNN and DQN can localize and segment the points of the object class efficiently. The 3D CNN and Residual RNN further extract robust and discriminative features of the points in the eye window, and thus greatly enhance the parsing accuracy of large-scale point clouds. Our method provides an automatic process that maps the raw data to the classification results. It also integrates object localization, segmentation and classification into one framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud classification methods.",0

To evaluate its performance, we compare our approach against several baseline methods on two real world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Overall, the proposed framework offers a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners working with large scale 3D data sets who require advanced semantic understanding capabilities.",1
"Unprecedented high volumes of data are becoming available with the growth of the advanced metering infrastructure.

In this paper, we explore for the first time in the smart grid context the benefits of using Deep Reinforcement Learning, a hybrid type of methods that combines Reinforcement Learning with Deep Learning, to perform on-line optimization of schedules for building energy management systems. The learning procedure was explored using two methods, Deep Q-learning and Deep Policy Gradient, both of them being extended to perform multiple actions simultaneously. The proposed approach was validated on the large-scale Pecan Street Inc. database. This highly-dimensional database includes information about photovoltaic power generation, electric vehicles as well as buildings appliances. Moreover, these on-line energy scheduling strategies could be used to provide real-time feedback to consumers to encourage more efficient use of electricity.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to optimize building energy consumption using deep reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed method combines RL with on-line data from building management systems and real-time weather forecasts to find optimal operating parameters that minimize energy costs while maintaining occupant comfort.

Simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce annual energy consumption by up to 24% compared to existing heuristics methods. Furthermore, the learned policies generalize well across different buildings and weather conditions, demonstrating the robustness of our methodology. Our work highlights the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of building operations and contribute towards sustainability goals.",1
"We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.",0

"Autonomous unpowered flight is a challenge for control and guidance systems: all the energy the aircraft might use during flight has to be harvested directly from the atmosphere. We investigate the design of an algorithm that optimizes the closed-loop control of a glider's bank and sideslip angles, while flying in the lower convective layer of the atmosphere in order to increase its mission endurance. Using a Reinforcement Learning approach, we demonstrate the possibility for real-time adaptation of the glider's behaviour to the time-varying and noisy conditions associated with thermal soaring flight. Our approach is online, data-based and model-free, hence avoids the pitfalls of aerological and aircraft modelling and allow us to deal with uncertainties and non-stationarity. Additionally, we put a particular emphasis on keeping low computational requirements in order to make on-board execution feasible. This article presents the stochastic, time-dependent aerological model used for simulation, together with a standard aircraft model. Then we introduce an adaptation of a Q-learning algorithm and demonstrate its ability to control the aircraft and improve its endurance by exploiting updrafts in non-stationary scenarios.",0
"This study evaluates the performance of a Q-learning algorithm as applied to model free autonomous soaring by comparing simulations with empirically collected flight data from actual gliders operating under diverse atmospheric conditions (thermal lift).

"We formulate tracking as an online decision-making process, where a tracking agent must follow an object despite ambiguous image frames and a limited computational budget. Crucially, the agent must decide where to look in the upcoming frames, when to reinitialize because it believes the target has been lost, and when to update its appearance model for the tracked object. Such decisions are typically made heuristically. Instead, we propose to learn an optimal decision-making policy by formulating tracking as a partially observable decision-making process (POMDP). We learn policies with deep reinforcement learning algorithms that need supervision (a reward signal) only when the track has gone awry. We demonstrate that sparse rewards allow us to quickly train on massive datasets, several orders of magnitude more than past work. Interestingly, by treating the data source of Internet videos as unlimited streams, we both learn and evaluate our trackers in a single, unified computational stream.",0

In particular, we show that our agents learn effective policies directly from streaming video inputs, requiring no preprocessing or extraction of relevant features beyond simple image cropping. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach compared to traditional methods. Our results highlight the potential for tracking-based reinforcement learning to enable new applications in robotics and computer vision.",1
"For sophisticated reinforcement learning (RL) systems to interact usefully with real-world environments, we need to communicate complex goals to these systems. In this work, we explore goals defined in terms of (non-expert) human preferences between pairs of trajectory segments. We show that this approach can effectively solve complex RL tasks without access to the reward function, including Atari games and simulated robot locomotion, while providing feedback on less than one percent of our agent's interactions with the environment. This reduces the cost of human oversight far enough that it can be practically applied to state-of-the-art RL systems. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we show that we can successfully train complex novel behaviors with about an hour of human time. These behaviors and environments are considerably more complex than any that have been previously learned from human feedback.",0

"Many real-world tasks involve multiple agents with partial observability and limited communication. Learning is challenging in these settings due to local viewpoints of agents, which perceive the world as non-stationary due to concurrently-exploring teammates. Approaches that learn specialized policies for individual tasks face problems when applied to the real world: not only do agents have to learn and store distinct policies for each task, but in practice identities of tasks are often non-observable, making these approaches inapplicable. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning under partial observability. We introduce a decentralized single-task learning approach that is robust to concurrent interactions of teammates, and present an approach for distilling single-task policies into a unified policy that performs well across multiple related tasks, without explicit provision of task identity.",0

"Most deep reinforcement learning algorithms are data inefficient in complex and rich environments, limiting their applicability to many scenarios. One direction for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared neural network parameters, where efficiency may be improved through transfer across related tasks. In practice, however, this is not usually observed, because gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively, making learning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the different reward schemes between tasks, which can easily lead to one task dominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new approach for joint training of multiple tasks, which we refer to as Distral (Distill & transfer learning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers, we propose to share a ""distilled"" policy that captures common behaviour across tasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay close to the shared policy, while the shared policy is trained by distillation to be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process are derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach supports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments, outperforming several related methods. Moreover, the proposed learning process is more robust and more stable---attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.",0

"Given a large number of unlabeled face images, face grouping aims at clustering the images into individual identities present in the data. This task remains a challenging problem despite the remarkable capability of deep learning approaches in learning face representation. In particular, grouping results can still be egregious given profile faces and a large number of uninteresting faces and noisy detections. Often, a user needs to correct the erroneous grouping manually. In this study, we formulate a novel face grouping framework that learns clustering strategy from ground-truth simulated behavior. This is achieved through imitation learning (a.k.a apprenticeship learning or learning by watching) via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In contrast to existing clustering approaches that group instances by similarity, our framework makes sequential decision to dynamically decide when to merge two face instances/groups driven by short- and long-term rewards. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms unsupervised and supervised baselines.",0
"One approach that has proven successful at grouping objects such as images and text is imitation learning. However, imitation learning has yet to be applied to grouping faces together into distinct groups. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether imitation learning could be used successfully to group faces into two categories – male and female. To test our hypothesis, participants were asked to sort a set of faces into either ""male"" or ""female."" They were then shown examples from each category along with one face that did not fit into any category, and were instructed to select the correct group for the outlier face. Participants showed significant accuracy rates on both pretests and posttests across all conditions. These results support our conclusion that imitation learning can be an effective method for categorizing faces based on gender. Further research should examine how imitation learning might be expanded to other types of object recognition tasks beyond facial features.",1
"In this paper, we propose a principled deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach that is able to accelerate the convergence rate of general deep neural networks (DNNs). With our approach, a deep RL agent (synonym for optimizer in this work) is used to automatically learn policies about how to schedule learning rates during the optimization of a DNN. The state features of the agent are learned from the weight statistics of the optimizee during training. The reward function of this agent is designed to learn policies that minimize the optimizee's training time given a certain performance goal. The actions of the agent correspond to changing the learning rate for the optimizee during training. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to use deep RL to learn how to optimize a large-sized DNN. We perform extensive experiments on a standard benchmark dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the policies learned by our approach.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for accelerating the training of deep neural networks using Deep Q-networks (DQN). Traditional methods for training deep neural networks can take significant time and computational resources due to their high dimensionality and nonlinear nature. In contrast, DQNs have been shown to efficiently learn policies that maximize expected cumulative rewards through reinforcement learning. By leveraging these capabilities, we propose a new framework that combines DNNs and DQNs to reduce the training time required for deep models. Our methodology involves first pretraining the DNN layer by layer, then combining the pretrained weights with Q-learning to optimize network parameters at each iteration. Our results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for speeding up the training process while maintaining or improving model accuracy on several benchmark datasets. Our work has important implications for real-world applications where quick deployment of accurate deep learning models is crucial, such as in autonomous vehicles and healthcare diagnostics.",1
"Visual servoing involves choosing actions that move a robot in response to observations from a camera, in order to reach a goal configuration in the world. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive application-specific feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, to enable quick adaptation to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use a sample-efficient fitted Q-iteration algorithm to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that we can learn an effective visual servo on a complex synthetic car following benchmark using just 20 training trajectory samples for reinforcement learning. We demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional approach based on image pixels or hand-designed keypoints, and we show an improvement in sample-efficiency of more than two orders of magnitude over standard model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

"In this work we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (RL) called Fitted Q-Iteration with model predictive control that can learn complex manipulation tasks by using visual servoing guided by learned feature representations and temporal abstraction. We demonstrate RL with Fitted Q-Iteration outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques on robotic grasping tasks while using more general policies than those found with human engineered features. Further, our method learns high performing policies in significantly fewer interactions with the environment than prior methods making it well suited for applications where interaction time is limited. The results presented here offer evidence that RL with Fitted Q-Iteration is capable of discovering effective solutions to challenging manipulation problems directly from raw sensory input without explicit engineering of task features or low level controllers. Finally, we provide qualitative examples demonstrating how our agent discovers meaningful subgoals during training through the use of model predictive control. We expect these findings to inspire further research into developing powerful and scalable automated manipulation systems able to operate in real world environments under minimal supervision. ------ In this study, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm known as Fitted Q-Iteration with Model Predictive Control (FQC). This approach combines visual servoing guidance with learned feature representations and temporal abstraction to enable robots to perform complex manipulation tasks. Our results show that FQC outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques across multiple benchmarks, including robotic grasping tasks. Notably, FQC learns effective policies using more general features than those handcrafted by humans, reducing the need for manual intervention. Additionally, our method requires fewer environmental interactions compared to previous approaches, making it ideal for settings with limited time resources. These findings support the potential of reinforcement learning with FQC to develop versatile robotic systems that can solve demanding manipulation problems directly from sensor inputs without relying on human engineering expertise.

Overall, our work offers a promising direction for developing efficient and effective RL algorithms.",1
"We consider the problem of provably optimal exploration in reinforcement learning for finite horizon MDPs. We show that an optimistic modification to value iteration achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{HSAT} + H^2S^2A+H\sqrt{T})$ where $H$ is the time horizon, $S$ the number of states, $A$ the number of actions and $T$ the number of time-steps. This result improves over the best previous known bound $\tilde{O}(HS \sqrt{AT})$ achieved by the UCRL2 algorithm of Jaksch et al., 2010. The key significance of our new results is that when $T\geq H^3S^3A$ and $SA\geq H$, it leads to a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{HSAT})$ that matches the established lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ up to a logarithmic factor. Our analysis contains two key insights. We use careful application of concentration inequalities to the optimal value function as a whole, rather than to the transitions probabilities (to improve scaling in $S$), and we define Bernstein-based ""exploration bonuses"" that use the empirical variance of the estimated values at the next states (to improve scaling in $H$).",0
"Abstract: In this paper, we provide new regret bounds for reinforcement learning algorithms that minimize their worst-case expected regret, known as minimax regret. Our results apply to both discrete and continuous state spaces and action sets, which generalizes prior work on minimax regret. We achieve these results by introducing novel analysis techniques based on martingale stopping times. Additionally, our bounds offer insight into the behavior of minimax regret in different regimes such as number of states/actions and time horizon. These findings could aid researchers designing new RL algorithms with provably low minimax regret. Finally, we empirically validate our analysis through simulations, showing significant improvement over existing methods. Overall, our work significantly advances understanding of minimax regret guarantees in RL.

"We propose a new neural sequence model training method in which the objective function is defined by $\alpha$-divergence. We demonstrate that the objective function generalizes the maximum-likelihood (ML)-based and reinforcement learning (RL)-based objective functions as special cases (i.e., ML corresponds to $\alpha \to 0$ and RL to $\alpha \to1$). We also show that the gradient of the objective function can be considered a mixture of ML- and RL-based objective gradients. The experimental results of a machine translation task show that minimizing the objective function with $\alpha  0$ outperforms $\alpha \to 0$, which corresponds to ML-based methods.",0
"A new approach to training neural sequence models using minimizing alpha divergence has been proposed. This method allows for more efficient use of data by optimizing the parameters to reduce the difference between predicted and true sequences while also addressing overfitting issues that can arise during training. By incorporating measures such as entropy regularization and gradient normalization into the loss function, this technique achieves improved performance on a variety of benchmark datasets. Additionally, the framework presented in this work can be applied to a range of model architectures and sequence prediction tasks, making it a versatile tool for researchers in the field.

"We propose a novel and flexible approach to meta-learning for learning-to-learn from only a few examples. Our framework is motivated by actor-critic reinforcement learning, but can be applied to both reinforcement and supervised learning. The key idea is to learn a meta-critic: an action-value function neural network that learns to criticise any actor trying to solve any specified task. For supervised learning, this corresponds to the novel idea of a trainable task-parametrised loss generator. This meta-critic approach provides a route to knowledge transfer that can flexibly deal with few-shot and semi-supervised conditions for both reinforcement and supervised learning. Promising results are shown on both reinforcement and supervised learning problems.",0

"The past few years have witnessed a growth in size and computational requirements for training and inference with neural networks. Currently, a common approach to address these requirements is to use a heterogeneous distributed environment with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Importantly, the decision of placing parts of the neural models on devices is often made by human experts based on simple heuristics and intuitions. In this paper, we propose a method which learns to optimize device placement for TensorFlow computational graphs. Key to our method is the use of a sequence-to-sequence model to predict which subsets of operations in a TensorFlow graph should run on which of the available devices. The execution time of the predicted placements is then used as the reward signal to optimize the parameters of the sequence-to-sequence model. Our main result is that on Inception-V3 for ImageNet classification, and on RNN LSTM, for language modeling and neural machine translation, our model finds non-trivial device placements that outperform hand-crafted heuristics and traditional algorithmic methods.",0
"In many machine learning applications, device placement optimization can greatly improve performance by reducing latency and increasing efficiency. This work presents a new approach for optimizing device placement using reinforcement learning. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where each state represents a possible configuration of devices and actions represent changes to that configuration. Our algorithm learns a policy that maximizes a reward function based on metrics such as response time and energy consumption. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to heuristics baselines, achieving significant improvements across a variety of scenarios. Additionally, we analyze how the learned policies trade off between these two objectives and provide insights into their behavior. Overall, this research advances the field of device placement optimization through the use of powerful reinforcement learning techniques.",1
"Existing action detection algorithms usually generate action proposals through an extensive search over the video at multiple temporal scales, which brings about huge computational overhead and deviates from the human perception procedure. We argue that the process of detecting actions should be naturally one of observation and refinement: observe the current window and refine the span of attended window to cover true action regions. In this paper, we propose an active action proposal model that learns to find actions through continuously adjusting the temporal bounds in a self-adaptive way. The whole process can be deemed as an agent, which is firstly placed at a position in the video at random, adopts a sequence of transformations on the current attended region to discover actions according to a learned policy. We utilize reinforcement learning, especially the Deep Q-learning algorithm to learn the agent's decision policy. In addition, we use temporal pooling operation to extract more effective feature representation for the long temporal window, and design a regression network to adjust the position offsets between predicted results and the ground truth. Experiment results on THUMOS 2014 validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can achieve competitive performance with current action detection algorithms via much fewer proposals.",0
"Abstract: This work presents a new self-adaptive proposal model for temporal action detection that utilizes reinforcement learning to automatically learn from both positive and negative feedback during training. Inspired by recent developments in object detection using Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2017) and video grounding (Chao et al., 2021), we propose a novel framework consisting of several key components: A region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN) to generate proposals at different scales; an attentional module that adaptively selects regions within each scale map and aggregates them into one feature vector representation of the entire image sequence; and finally, our self-adaptive policy refinement method which uses deep Q-learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992) to update the parameters of the RCNN and selection module based on binary cross entropy loss from generated proposals evaluated against their corresponding ground truth labels. Our experiments show improvements over baseline methods across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach for temporal action detection.",1
"Observational learning is a type of learning that occurs as a function of observing, retaining and possibly replicating or imitating the behaviour of another agent. It is a core mechanism appearing in various instances of social learning and has been found to be employed in several intelligent species, including humans. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the explicit modelling of other agents is necessary to achieve observational learning through machine learning. Especially, we argue that observational learning can emerge from pure Reinforcement Learning (RL), potentially coupled with memory. Through simple scenarios, we demonstrate that an RL agent can leverage the information provided by the observations of an other agent performing a task in a shared environment. The other agent is only observed through the effect of its actions on the environment and never explicitly modeled. Two key aspects are borrowed from observational learning: i) the observer behaviour needs to change as a result of viewing a 'teacher' (another agent) and ii) the observer needs to be motivated somehow to engage in making use of the other agent's behaviour. The later is naturally modeled by RL, by correlating the learning agent's reward with the teacher agent's behaviour.",0
"This paper investigates how reinforcement learning can be used to enable artificial agents to learn through observation alone. We show that careful design choices allow us to create agents capable of acquiring significant amounts of knowledge from raw sensory inputs without any form of supervision, guidance, or rewards beyond their own trial-and-error exploration. Our experimental results suggest that carefully designed exploration strategies can be enough to generate meaningful behavioral progress, even when all prior domain knowledge is lacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these behaviors continue to improve over time as experience accumulates, enabling truly autonomous lifelong learning across a wide range of tasks. These findings offer insights into both computational approaches to understanding natural intelligence, as well as potential future applications in robotics and computer science.",1
"Node-perturbation learning is a type of statistical gradient descent algorithm that can be applied to problems where the objective function is not explicitly formulated, including reinforcement learning. It estimates the gradient of an objective function by using the change in the object function in response to the perturbation. The value of the objective function for an unperturbed output is called a baseline. Cho et al. proposed node-perturbation learning with a noisy baseline. In this paper, we report on building the statistical mechanics of Cho's model and on deriving coupled differential equations of order parameters that depict learning dynamics. We also show how to derive the generalization error by solving the differential equations of order parameters. On the basis of the results, we show that Cho's results are also apply in general cases and show some general performances of Cho's model.",0
In statistical mechanics we study complex systems by analyzing how their components interact. We can analyze learning as if individual nodes that make up our datasets have individual opinions on what’s true.

"Teaching a computer to read and answer general questions pertaining to a document is a challenging yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we describe a novel neural network architecture called the Reasoning Network (ReasoNet) for machine comprehension tasks. ReasoNets make use of multiple turns to effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents, and answers. Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns during inference, ReasoNets introduce a termination state to relax this constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning, ReasoNets can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer. ReasoNets have achieved exceptional performance in machine comprehension datasets, including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, the Stanford SQuAD dataset, and a structured Graph Reachability dataset.",0
"Title: Optimizing Machine Comprehension with Reasoning  Machine comprehension has made significant strides in recent years, with models achieving state-of-the art results on benchmark datasets. However, these models often struggle with answering questions that require reasoning over the text, such as understanding relationships between entities or making inferences based on implicit knowledge. In this work, we propose ReasoNet, a novel neural network architecture designed to improve machine comprehension by incorporating explicit reasoning mechanisms into the model.  ReasoNet consists of two main components: a pre-trained language model and a graph reasoning module. The language model processes input texts and generates representations of their meanings, while the graph reasoning module uses this information to construct a logical representation of the meaning. This allows the model to efficiently reason over the text and generate more accurate answers to complex questions. We evaluate our approach on several popular machine comprehension datasets and show that ReasoNet outperforms existing baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness at improving machine comprehension through reasoning.  Our findings suggest that explicitly incorporating reasoning mechanisms can significantly enhance the performance of machine comprehension systems, enabling them to better understand complex texts and provide more accurate answers. This research paves the way for future advancements in natural language processing, where effective reasoning over textual data is crucial.

"We propose the first multistage intervention framework that tackles fake news in social networks by combining reinforcement learning with a point process network activity model. The spread of fake news and mitigation events within the network is modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process with additional exogenous control terms. By choosing a feature representation of states, defining mitigation actions and constructing reward functions to measure the effectiveness of mitigation activities, we map the problem of fake news mitigation into the reinforcement learning framework. We develop a policy iteration method unique to the multivariate networked point process, with the goal of optimizing the actions for maximal total reward under budget constraints. Our method shows promising performance in real-time intervention experiments on a Twitter network to mitigate a surrogate fake news campaign, and outperforms alternatives on synthetic datasets.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to mitigating fake news using point process theory and interventions based on network epidemiology principles. With the increasing prevalence of fake news online, there is a pressing need to develop effective methods to identify and counteract its spread. Our proposed method combines traditional machine learning techniques with spatially-explicit modeling to analyze social media data and detect patterns associated with the diffusion of fake news. We then use these insights to design targeted interventions that disrupt the spread of harmful content at key points in the networks where they originate or gain traction. In addition, our framework incorporates mechanisms for monitoring and adaptively adjusting our interventions based on real-time feedback from online users. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the impact of fake news across multiple social media platforms.

We empirically show that our augmented DQN has lower sample complexity when simultaneously learning subtasks with negative transfer, without degrading performance when learning subtasks with positive transfer.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising areas of artificial intelligence research, enabling agents to learn complex tasks by interacting with their environment.

"This paper introduces Dex, a reinforcement learning environment toolkit specialized for training and evaluation of continual learning methods as well as general reinforcement learning problems. We also present the novel continual learning method of incremental learning, where a challenging environment is solved using optimal weight initialization learned from first solving a similar easier environment. We show that incremental learning can produce vastly superior results than standard methods by providing a strong baseline method across ten Dex environments. We finally develop a saliency method for qualitative analysis of reinforcement learning, which shows the impact incremental learning has on network attention.",0
"This project introduces Dex, an algorithm designed for deep reinforcement learning that allows agents to learn from trial and error without suffering excessive damage caused by trial-and-error exploration. While deep reinforcement learning has been successful at solving many problems, most methods rely on human expertise (human knowledge + intuition) such as handcrafting intricate reward shaping functions and designing state representation systems. However, these approaches tend to fail when faced with more complex tasks and environments where it becomes computationally expensive to solve by manual engineering. Consequently, there have been growing interests towards automating the process of generating machine learning algorithms via deep neural networks and evolutionary techniques inspired by nature’s evolution processes. To achieve this aim, we create Dex to combine multi-agent competition and experience sharing into one system so that multiple agents can learn faster while limiting their exposure to harmful experiences. We evaluate Dex against several benchmark domains and show competitive performance against strong baselines under most settings. Future work includes applying Dex to real-world applications which require robust solutions capable of dealing with large environmental changes over time as well as addressing the challenges brought by partial observability and continuous action spaces. Our contributions are thus to introduce a new model, algorithm, and framework that integrate experience sharing and competition mechanisms to encourage agents in making correct decisions while minimizing potential damages from trials. We believe our approach represents an important step toward developing intelligent artificial agents that may perform effectively across diverse application domains while adapting to varying circumstances.

"We describe a framework for multitask deep reinforcement learning guided by policy sketches. Sketches annotate tasks with sequences of named subtasks, providing information about high-level structural relationships among tasks but not how to implement them---specifically not providing the detailed guidance used by much previous work on learning policy abstractions for RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations). To learn from sketches, we present a model that associates every subtask with a modular subpolicy, and jointly maximizes reward over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies. Optimization is accomplished via a decoupled actor--critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from multiple dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in three environments featuring both discrete and continuous control, and with sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a number of high-level subgoals. Experiments show that using our approach to learn policies guided by sketches gives better performance than existing techniques for learning task-specific or shared policies, while naturally inducing a library of interpretable primitive behaviors that can be recombined to rapidly adapt to new tasks.",0
"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have demonstrated impressive results on complex tasks such as video games and simulated robotics.

To address these issues, we propose modular multitask reinforcement learning with policy sketches. Our approach leverages recent advances in meta-learning and skill abstraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on multiple tasks from Atari, MiniWorld, and Roboschool. Our findings show that our method outperforms prior work in sample efficiency, adaptability, and transfer performance. Further analysis reveals promising properties towards better understanding of humanlike adaptation.

"Representation learning and option discovery are two of the biggest challenges in reinforcement learning (RL). Proto-value functions (PVFs) are a well-known approach for representation learning in MDPs. In this paper we address the option discovery problem by showing how PVFs implicitly define options. We do it by introducing eigenpurposes, intrinsic reward functions derived from the learned representations. The options discovered from eigenpurposes traverse the principal directions of the state space. They are useful for multiple tasks because they are discovered without taking the environment's rewards into consideration. Moreover, different options act at different time scales, making them helpful for exploration. We demonstrate features of eigenpurposes in traditional tabular domains as well as in Atari 2600 games.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to option discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) using a Laplacian framework.

"This paper presents the input convex neural network architecture. These are scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural networks with constraints on the network parameters such that the output of the network is a convex function of (some of) the inputs. The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization over some inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to settings including structured prediction, data imputation, reinforcement learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many existing neural network architectures can be made input-convex with a minor modification, and develop specialized optimization algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.",0
"Neural networks have proven themselves powerful tools for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. However, their training can often require large amounts of data and computational resources. In this work, we present a method for training neural networks that greatly reduces both requirements. Our approach relies on using input convex activation functions during the forward pass, which allows us to use strong guarantees regarding their gradients and Hessians throughout the network. This results in significantly smaller error norm bounds compared to traditional rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations. Additionally, we show how our technique can be applied to common architectures such as ResNet and VGG without any loss of accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets across different domains, including CIFAR, ImageNet, and sentiment analysis. Overall, our findings indicate that input convex neural networks hold great promise in reducing the cost of training high quality models while maintaining competitive performance.",1
"We discuss the relative merits of optimistic and randomized approaches to exploration in reinforcement learning. Optimistic approaches presented in the literature apply an optimistic boost to the value estimate at each state-action pair and select actions that are greedy with respect to the resulting optimistic value function. Randomized approaches sample from among statistically plausible value functions and select actions that are greedy with respect to the random sample. Prior computational experience suggests that randomized approaches can lead to far more statistically efficient learning. We present two simple analytic examples that elucidate why this is the case. In principle, there should be optimistic approaches that fare well relative to randomized approaches, but that would require intractable computation. Optimistic approaches that have been proposed in the literature sacrifice statistical efficiency for the sake of computational efficiency. Randomized approaches, on the other hand, may enable simultaneous statistical and computational efficiency.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress made in reinforcement learning (RL). Researchers have explored different approaches to improve RL algorithms including optimism versus randomization. While both methods aim at improving efficiency over traditional model-free value iteration by reducing variance while maintaining computational efficiency, they differ greatly in their implementation strategies. This paper aims to compare these two methods on selected benchmark tasks, evaluate which method performs better and under which conditions. Furthermore, we investigate how these differences affect final performance metrics. By conducting extensive experiments, our results show that optimistic methods outperform randomized methods due to its ability to provide more accurate estimates. We further provide insights into selecting appropriate baselines for each method based on task difficulty. These findings suggest that optimism plays an essential role in improving sample efficiency for deep RL. Given that RL can require large amounts of data, these improvements are critical for practical applications.",1
"Computational results demonstrate that posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) dramatically outperforms algorithms driven by optimism, such as UCRL2. We provide insight into the extent of this performance boost and the phenomenon that drives it. We leverage this insight to establish an $\tilde{O}(H\sqrt{SAT})$ Bayesian expected regret bound for PSRL in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes, where $H$ is the horizon, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions and $T$ is the time elapsed. This improves upon the best previous bound of $\tilde{O}(H S \sqrt{AT})$ for any reinforcement learning algorithm.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using deep learning algorithms to tackle reinforcement learning problems. One key challenge faced by these models is how to effectively explore the state space while minimizing the risk of taking suboptimal actions that could lead to negative rewards. Two common approaches to addressing this issue are posterior sampling and optimism.  Posterior sampling involves generating new states from the model's predictive distribution and following up on those states as if they were true states. This approach provides a principled method for balancing exploration and exploitation by randomly selecting action policies according to their probabilities under the current belief state, which naturally incorporates both uncertainty and optimality.  On the other hand, optimism is based on assuming the worst possible outcome under the current policy, which can result in excessively conservative behavior and reduced exploration. While optimism is computationally efficient and easy to implement, it often leads to poor performance in practice, particularly in complex environments where uncertainties play a crucial role.  This paper argues that posterior sampling is superior to optimism for reinforcement learning tasks due to its ability to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of posterior sampling over several benchmark domains and compare the results against a range of prior methods. Our findings show that posterior sampling significantly outperforms optimism across all tested domains, even when compared against state-of-the-art techniques such as advantage actor-critic (A2C).  Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering uncertainty in decision making for reinforcement learning, and demonstrates that posterior sampling is a powerful tool for achieving better exploration strategies in challenging environments. By bridging theory and practice, we aim to contribute towards building more robust artificial intelligence agents that can perform well in real-world scenarios.",1
"Reward function design and exploration time are arguably the biggest obstacles to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real world. In many real-world tasks, designing a reward function takes considerable hand engineering and often requires additional sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many interesting tasks consist of multiple implicit intermediate steps that must be executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not necessarily provide feedback on these intermediate steps. To address these issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is able to identify key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit specification of sub-goals. The resulting reward functions can then be used by an RL agent to learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned reward, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also show that our method can be used to learn a real-world door opening skill using a real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by a human using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results showing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and without supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.

"In imitation learning, an agent learns by observing human demonstrations and then replicating those actions on its own. However, traditional imitation learning often relies on supervision signals such as success/failure feedback or human ratings. This work presents a new method called ""Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning"" which removes the need for explicit guidance during training, allowing agents to learn solely from raw perceptions without any prior knowledge of their objectives. By doing so, we improve both the robustness and efficiency of the learning process and make it applicable to real-world scenarios where manual annotations may be difficult or impractical. Our experiments show that our approach can outperform existing methods even when given only limited data, highlighting the potential benefits of unsupervised reinforcement learning for imitation tasks.",1
"We learn recurrent neural network optimizers trained on simple synthetic functions by gradient descent. We show that these learned optimizers exhibit a remarkable degree of transfer in that they can be used to efficiently optimize a broad range of derivative-free black-box functions, including Gaussian process bandits, simple control objectives, global optimization benchmarks and hyper-parameter tuning tasks. Up to the training horizon, the learned optimizers learn to trade-off exploration and exploitation, and compare favourably with heavily engineered Bayesian optimization packages for hyper-parameter tuning.",0
"Abstract: In machine learning research today, many algorithms focus on minimizing some loss function over examples using gradient descent. However, there has been less work done on how to optimize those algorithms themselves. In particular, we would like to know how well gradient descent can generalize to unseen tasks, and whether it can learn from only one set of training data without forgetting what it learned previously. We therefore propose a new method based on a meta-learning objective inspired by MAML, but which learns faster than standard MAML. Our method outperforms both vanilla gradient descent and existing meta-learning methods when applied to several different datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN. Our results show that our algorithm is capable of quickly adapting to novel environments and maintains good performance across multiple tasks. This suggests that gradient descent may have more potential as a tool for building powerful artificial intelligence systems than was previously thought. Finally, we hope this study will inspire further investigation into gradient descent’s capabilities, particularly in real-world applications where computational resources are limited.

"In this paper we explore methods to exploit symmetries for ensuring sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL), this problem deserves ever increasing attention with the recent advances in the use of deep networks for complex RL tasks which require large amount of training data. We introduce a novel method to detect symmetries using reward trails observed during episodic experience and prove its completeness. We also provide a framework to incorporate the discovered symmetries for functional approximation. Finally we show that the use of potential based reward shaping is especially effective for our symmetry exploitation mechanism. Experiments on various classical problems show that our method improves the learning performance significantly by utilizing symmetry information.",0

Then, we describe our methodology for identifying and incorporating symmetries into the learning process before presenting empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple domains.

"Understanding the simultaneously very diverse and intricately fine-grained set of possible human actions is a critical open problem in computer vision. Manually labeling training videos is feasible for some action classes but doesn't scale to the full long-tailed distribution of actions. A promising way to address this is to leverage noisy data from web queries to learn new actions, using semi-supervised or ""webly-supervised"" approaches. However, these methods typically do not learn domain-specific knowledge, or rely on iterative hand-tuned data labeling policies. In this work, we instead propose a reinforcement learning-based formulation for selecting the right examples for training a classifier from noisy web search results. Our method uses Q-learning to learn a data labeling policy on a small labeled training dataset, and then uses this to automatically label noisy web data for new visual concepts. Experiments on the challenging Sports-1M action recognition benchmark as well as on additional fine-grained and newly emerging action classes demonstrate that our method is able to learn good labeling policies for noisy data and use this to learn accurate visual concept classifiers.",0

Our results show that our method significantly outperforms prior methods on several benchmark tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most of them even without additional fine-tuning.",1
"Policy evaluation is a crucial step in many reinforcement-learning procedures, which estimates a value function that predicts states' long-term value under a given policy. In this paper, we focus on policy evaluation with linear function approximation over a fixed dataset. We first transform the empirical policy evaluation problem into a (quadratic) convex-concave saddle point problem, and then present a primal-dual batch gradient method, as well as two stochastic variance reduction methods for solving the problem. These algorithms scale linearly in both sample size and feature dimension. Moreover, they achieve linear convergence even when the saddle-point problem has only strong concavity in the dual variables but no strong convexity in the primal variables. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.",0
"Policy evaluation methods play a critical role in assessing the effectiveness of policies in achieving their desired objectives. However, due to complexities involved in real-world systems, policy evaluations often face challenges in terms of data availability, quality, and variability. As a result, stochastic variance reduction methods have emerged as promising approaches that aim to reduce these uncertainties by leveraging historical data and probabilistic models. This work presents an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques used in stochastic variance reduction methods (SVRM) for policy evaluation purposes. We begin by discussing common challenges encountered in policy evaluation, followed by an introduction to SVRM and how they tackle such challenges. Then we examine existing literature on SVRM methods across different domains including finance, economics, healthcare, education, and social science. Our analysis highlights key insights into successful applications of SVRM techniques and identifies open research directions for future development. Ultimately, our goal is to provide practitioners and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of SVRM tools and their potential benefits towards informed decision making under uncertainty. By bridging the gap between theory and practice through this review, we envision improved adoption and tailoring of SVRM methods to suit diverse policy evaluation needs.",1
"Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in simulation to construct policies useful in real life is challenging. This is often attributed to the sequential decision making aspect: inaccuracies in simulation accumulate over multiple steps, hence the simulated trajectories diverge from what would happen in reality.   In our work we show the need to consider another important aspect: the mismatch in simulating control. We bring attention to the need for modeling control as well as dynamics, since oversimplifying assumptions about applying actions of RL policies could make the policies fail on real-world systems.   We design a simulator for solving a pivoting task (of interest in Robotics) and demonstrate that even a simple simulator designed with RL in mind outperforms high-fidelity simulators when it comes to learning a policy that is to be deployed on a real robotic system. We show that a phenomenon that is hard to model - friction - could be exploited successfully, even when RL is performed using a simulator with a simple dynamics and noise model. Hence, we demonstrate that as long as the main sources of uncertainty are identified, it could be possible to learn policies applicable to real systems even using a simple simulator.   RL-compatible simulators could open the possibilities for applying a wide range of RL algorithms in various fields. This is important, since currently data sparsity in fields like healthcare and education frequently forces researchers and engineers to only consider sample-efficient RL approaches. Successful simulator-aided RL could increase flexibility of experimenting with RL algorithms and help applying RL policies to real-world settings in fields where data is scarce. We believe that lessons learned in Robotics could help other fields design RL-compatible simulators, so we summarize our experience and conclude with suggestions.",0
"Simulation has become an essential tool for many fields as it allows researchers to test hypotheses without risking damage to expensive equipment, harm to living subjects or dangerous situations for human operators. Recent advances in machine learning have made simulation even more powerful by enabling the use of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that can generate their own training data from simulations. In order to fully unleash the potential of simulators combined with RL, there needs to be careful consideration during the design process of these systems. This paper focuses on exploring how certain aspects such as state representation, reward functions, agent architectures, system architecture and testing methodologies should be designed specifically with RL applications in mind. We provide insights into each aspect and highlight their importance through case studies and experiments. By following our guidelines, we show significant improvements in performance compared to traditional approaches. Our work provides valuable insight into the future of using simulation in conjunction with RL and demonstrates the power of well thought out system designs.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising and powerful technique for automatically acquiring control policies that can process raw sensory inputs, such as images, and perform complex behaviors. However, extending deep RL to real-world robotic tasks has proven challenging, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous flight, where a trial-and-error learning process is often impractical. In this paper, we explore the following question: can we train vision-based navigation policies entirely in simulation, and then transfer them into the real world to achieve real-world flight without a single real training image? We propose a learning method that we call CAD$^2$RL, which can be used to perform collision-free indoor flight in the real world while being trained entirely on 3D CAD models. Our method uses single RGB images from a monocular camera, without needing to explicitly reconstruct the 3D geometry of the environment or perform explicit motion planning. Our learned collision avoidance policy is represented by a deep convolutional neural network that directly processes raw monocular images and outputs velocity commands. This policy is trained entirely on simulated images, with a Monte Carlo policy evaluation algorithm that directly optimizes the network's ability to produce collision-free flight. By highly randomizing the rendering settings for our simulated training set, we show that we can train a policy that generalizes to the real world, without requiring the simulator to be particularly realistic or high-fidelity. We evaluate our method by flying a real quadrotor through indoor environments, and further evaluate the design choices in our simulator through a series of ablation studies on depth prediction.

"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using computer vision techniques to enable robots to interact with their environment more effectively. One area that has received particular attention is real-time object detection and localization, which refers to the ability of a robot to accurately identify objects within its field of view and determine their location relative to itself. While there have been many advances in this area, current approaches still often rely on large amounts of annotated data and specialized hardware.  In contrast, our work presents a new method for real-image single flight (CAD2RL) that enables accurate object detection and localization using only synthetic images generated from three-dimensional models. This approach addresses some of the limitations of traditional methods by allowing us to train detectors on a diverse set of synthetic examples that cover a wide range of possible scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that these detectors can then be applied to real-world environments, achieving results comparable to those obtained using training sets based on actual images.  Our contributions include developing a novel framework for generating synthetic datasets tailored to object detection tasks and evaluating the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experimental validation. We believe that our work represents a significant step forward in enabling robots to perform complex perception tasks in dynamic real-world settings, paving the way for more advanced autonomous systems.",1
"In several realistic situations, an interactive learning agent can practice and refine its strategy before going on to be evaluated. For instance, consider a student preparing for a series of tests. She would typically take a few practice tests to know which areas she needs to improve upon. Based of the scores she obtains in these practice tests, she would formulate a strategy for maximizing her scores in the actual tests. We treat this scenario in the context of an agent exploring a fixed-horizon episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the agent can practice on the MDP for some number of episodes (not necessarily known in advance) before starting to incur regret for its actions.   During practice, the agent's goal must be to maximize the probability of following an optimal policy. This is akin to the problem of Pure Exploration (PE). We extend the PE problem of Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) to MDPs and propose a Bayesian algorithm called Posterior Sampling for Pure Exploration (PSPE), which is similar to its bandit counterpart. We show that the Bayesian simple regret converges at an optimal exponential rate when using PSPE.   When the agent starts being evaluated, its goal would be to minimize the cumulative regret incurred. This is akin to the problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent uses the Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning algorithm (PSRL) initialized with the posteriors of the practice phase. We hypothesize that this PSPE + PSRL combination is an optimal strategy for minimizing regret in RL problems with an initial practice phase. We show empirical results which prove that having a lower simple regret at the end of the practice phase results in having lower cumulative regret during evaluation.",0

"Off-policy model-free deep reinforcement learning methods using previously collected data can improve sample efficiency over on-policy policy gradient techniques. On the other hand, on-policy algorithms are often more stable and easier to use. This paper examines, both theoretically and empirically, approaches to merging on- and off-policy updates for deep reinforcement learning. Theoretical results show that off-policy updates with a value function estimator can be interpolated with on-policy policy gradient updates whilst still satisfying performance bounds. Our analysis uses control variate methods to produce a family of policy gradient algorithms, with several recently proposed algorithms being special cases of this family. We then provide an empirical comparison of these techniques with the remaining algorithmic details fixed, and show how different mixing of off-policy gradient estimates with on-policy samples contribute to improvements in empirical performance. The final algorithm provides a generalization and unification of existing deep policy gradient techniques, has theoretical guarantees on the bias introduced by off-policy updates, and improves on the state-of-the-art model-free deep RL methods on a number of OpenAI Gym continuous control benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied successfully to many complex realworld problems. However, one major challenge in applying DRL to these tasks remains high variance gradient estimators that result from on-policy methods such as REINFORCE. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method called interpolated policy gradients (IPG). This approach combines the advantages of both onand off-policy estimation by blending importance sampling correction terms into the objective function. Our main contributions are: We develop a general framework for IPG which can be used in tandem with any actorcritic algorithm and shows significant stability improvements over standard REINFORCE; and we provide extensive empirical evaluation across multiple MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrating state-of-theart performance compared against other popular baselines.",1
"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which updates the model parameters by adding a local gradient times a learning rate at each step, is widely used in model training of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks. It is observed that the models trained by SGD are sensitive to learning rates and good learning rates are problem specific. We propose an algorithm to automatically learn learning rates using neural network based actor-critic methods from deep reinforcement learning (RL).In particular, we train a policy network called actor to decide the learning rate at each step during training, and a value network called critic to give feedback about quality of the decision (e.g., the goodness of the learning rate outputted by the actor) that the actor made. The introduction of auxiliary actor and critic networks helps the main network achieve better performance. Experiments on different datasets and network architectures show that our approach leads to better convergence of SGD than human-designed competitors.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing complex optimization problems in machine learning. One area where reinforcement learning has shown great promise is in controlling the learning rate during training. In traditional machine learning algorithms, the learning rate is typically set manually based on heuristics or empirical knowledge. However, finding the optimal learning rate can be challenging and often requires significant trial and error.  In this work, we present a novel approach for using reinforcement learning to control the learning rate during training. Our method learns the optimal learning rate by interacting with the environment through feedback from rewards and penalties. By doing so, our algorithm can adaptively adjust the learning rate according to the current state of the model and the task at hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark tasks, showing that our method outperforms both fixed learning rate methods and manual hyperparameter tuning. Overall, our results show that reinforcement learning is a promising technique for automating the process of learning rate selection in machine learning.",1
"Partially observable environments present an important open challenge in the domain of sequential control learning with delayed rewards. Despite numerous attempts during the two last decades, the majority of reinforcement learning algorithms and associated approximate models, applied to this context, still assume Markovian state transitions. In this paper, we explore the use of a recently proposed attention-based model, the Gated End-to-End Memory Network, for sequential control. We call the resulting model the Gated End-to-End Memory Policy Network. More precisely, we use a model-free value-based algorithm to learn policies for partially observed domains using this memory-enhanced neural network. This model is end-to-end learnable and it features unbounded memory. Indeed, because of its attention mechanism and associated non-parametric memory, the proposed model allows us to define an attention mechanism over the observation stream unlike recurrent models. We show encouraging results that illustrate the capability of our attention-based model in the context of the continuous-state non-stationary control problem of stock trading. We also present an OpenAI Gym environment for simulated stock exchange and explain its relevance as a benchmark for the field of non-Markovian decision process learning.",0
"In recent years, end-to-end memory policy networks have emerged as powerful models for deep reinforcement learning tasks. These models allow agents to learn complex behaviors by directly mapping raw sensory inputs to actions without requiring handcrafted features or intermediate representations. However, most existing memory policy networks operate on Markov decision processes (MDPs), which assume that state transitions are stationary and independent over time. In practice, many real-world problems exhibit non-stationarities such as changes in reward functions, transition probabilities, and even hidden states themselves. In this work, we propose gated end-to-end memory policy networks, a variant of memory policy networks designed to handle non-Markovian decision making. By utilizing explicit memorization gates, these models can selectively store information from previous interactions, enabling more effective adaptations to evolving environments. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark control domains with varying levels of stochasticity, including cartpole swingup, mountain car, and robotics manipulation tasks. Results showcase the effectiveness of our method compared to strong baseline methods while providing insight into the mechanisms underlying gated end-to-end memory policies.",1
"Deep neural network (DNN) based approaches hold significant potential for reinforcement learning (RL) and have already shown remarkable gains over state-of-art methods in a number of applications. The effectiveness of DNN methods can be attributed to leveraging the abundance of supervised data to learn value functions, Q-functions, and policy function approximations without the need for feature engineering. Nevertheless, the deployment of DNN-based predictors with very deep architectures can pose an issue due to computational and other resource constraints at test-time in a number of applications. We propose a novel approach for reducing the average latency by learning a computationally efficient gating function that is capable of recognizing states in a sequential decision process for which policy prescriptions of a shallow network suffices and deeper layers of the DNN have little marginal utility. The overall system is adaptive in that it dynamically switches control actions based on state-estimates in order to reduce average latency without sacrificing terminal performance. We experiment with a number of alternative loss-functions to train gating functions and shallow policies and show that in a number of applications a speed-up of up to almost 5X can be obtained with little loss in performance.",0
"This paper presents a sequential decision making framework using deep neural networks that can operate under test-time budget constraints.

Our method efficiently balances exploration and exploitation by choosing actions proportional to their values estimated by the neural network. Our approach uses only the samples generated during tree expansion, and each action selection has a fixed cost allowing us to control the overall amount of computation used while maximizing rewards. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark domains. Additionally, we showcase how our technique performs well even when provided with limited training data compared to traditional model-based methods. Lastly, we provide insightful analysis regarding the impacts of different components in the proposed algorithm, including network architecture design choices and hyperparameter tuning.

"For many applications of reinforcement learning it can be more convenient to specify both a reward function and constraints, rather than trying to design behavior through the reward function. For example, systems that physically interact with or around humans should satisfy safety constraints. Recent advances in policy search algorithms (Mnih et al., 2016, Schulman et al., 2015, Lillicrap et al., 2016, Levine et al., 2016) have enabled new capabilities in high-dimensional control, but do not consider the constrained setting.   We propose Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning with guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration. Our method allows us to train neural network policies for high-dimensional control while making guarantees about policy behavior all throughout training. Our guarantees are based on a new theoretical result, which is of independent interest: we prove a bound relating the expected returns of two policies to an average divergence between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated robot locomotion tasks where the agent must satisfy constraints motivated by safety.",0

"Quantum computing has shown great potential as a tool for solving complex optimization problems due to the exponential speedup offered by quantum algorithms over classical methods. One such application is free energy based reinforcement learning (RL), which utilizes the negative free energy bound on the log Bayes risk to maximize expected reward.

"In this paper, we present a novel method of no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), which is to predict the perceptual quality score of a given image without using any reference image. The proposed method harnesses three functions (i) the visual attention mechanism, which affects many aspects of visual perception including image quality assessment, however, is overlooked in the NR-IQA literature. The method assumes that the fixation areas on an image contain key information to the process of IQA. (ii) the robust averaging strategy, which is a means \--- supported by psychology studies \--- to integrating multiple/step-wise evidence to make a final perceptual judgment. (iii) the multi-task learning, which is believed to be an effectual means to shape representation learning and could result in a more generalized model.   To exploit the synergy of the three, we consider the NR-IQA as a dynamic perception process, in which the model samples a sequence of ""informative"" areas and aggregates the information to learn a representation for the tasks of jointly predicting the image quality score and the distortion type.   The model learning is implemented by a reinforcement strategy, in which the rewards of both tasks guide the learning of the optimal sampling policy to acquire the ""task-informative"" image regions so that the predictions can be made accurately and efficiently (in terms of the sampling steps). The reinforcement learning is realized by a deep network with the policy gradient method and trained through back-propagation.   In experiments, the model is tested on the TID2008 dataset and it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model is very efficient in the sense that a small number of fixations are used in NR-IQA.",0
This paper presents a novel approach to no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant regions of an image. Traditional NR-IQA methods often struggle with assessing image quality due to their inability to distinguish between distortions caused by compression artifacts and those introduced by other factors such as content complexity or viewpoint changes. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by employing an encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention modules to identify important features that most accurately represent the visual quality of the input images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA models across several benchmark datasets while achieving competitive performance on full-reference IQA metrics.,1
"Recent advances in combining deep neural network architectures with reinforcement learning techniques have shown promising potential results in solving complex control problems with high dimensional state and action spaces. Inspired by these successes, in this paper, we build two kinds of reinforcement learning algorithms: deep policy-gradient and value-function based agents which can predict the best possible traffic signal for a traffic intersection. At each time step, these adaptive traffic light control agents receive a snapshot of the current state of a graphical traffic simulator and produce control signals. The policy-gradient based agent maps its observation directly to the control signal, however the value-function based agent first estimates values for all legal control signals. The agent then selects the optimal control action with the highest value. Our methods show promising results in a traffic network simulated in the SUMO traffic simulator, without suffering from instability issues during the training process.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to traffic light control using deep policy-gradient and value-function based reinforcement learning. Traditional methods for controlling traffic lights use predefined rules that can become quickly outdated as road conditions change. With our proposed method, we train artificial intelligence agents in simulation to make decisions regarding how to optimize traffic flow through intersections. We evaluate both on-policy and off-policy algorithms for training these agents and compare their performance in terms of minimizing travel time for all cars while maximizing safety at intersections. Our results show that the off-policy algorithm significantly reduces travel times without sacrificing safety. We conclude by discussing potential applications of our system beyond just optimizing traffic signal timings but potentially integrating other features like realtime car detection and adaptive cruise controls among others, and possible future directions for research.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to learn complex tasks using highly general policy classes. However, sparse reward problems remain a significant challenge. Exploration methods based on novelty detection have been particularly successful in such settings but typically require generative or predictive models of the observations, which can be difficult to train when the observations are very high-dimensional and complex, as in the case of raw images. We propose a novelty detection algorithm for exploration that is based entirely on discriminatively trained exemplar models, where classifiers are trained to discriminate each visited state against all others. Intuitively, novel states are easier to distinguish against other states seen during training.

However, there still exist several challenges that hinder their performance and generalization abilities across different domains. In our work, we aim to address these challenges by exploring exemplar models for deep reinforcement learning problems. We present two methods—Ex2Train and Ex2Transfer—that use exemplars as training data to train new models with improved generalization capabilities, effectively solving tasks without requiring vast quantities of data. Our results show that these methods can significantly outperform baseline RL models and transfer learned knowledge across similar tasks, providing evidence of the effectiveness of using exemplar models for deep reinforcement learning.",1
"In recent years, model-free methods that use deep learning have achieved great success in many different reinforcement learning environments. Most successful approaches focus on solving a single task, while multi-task reinforcement learning remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a model based approach to deep reinforcement learning which we use to solve different tasks simultaneously. We show that our approach not only does not degrade but actually benefits from learning multiple tasks. For our model, we also present a new kind of recurrent neural network inspired by residual networks that decouples memory from computation allowing to model complex environments that do not require lots of memory.",0

In addition, we discuss how the combination of multi-task learning and deep models can allow agents to learn more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods. Our findings suggest that this method has great potential for improving the capabilities of autonomous systems in complex environments.",1
"Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and costs hospitals billions annually. Treating a septic patient is highly challenging, because individual patients respond very differently to medical interventions and there is no universally agreed-upon treatment for sepsis. Understanding more about a patient's physiological state at a given time could hold the key to effective treatment policies. In this work, we propose a new approach to deduce optimal treatment policies for septic patients by using continuous state-space models and deep reinforcement learning. Learning treatment policies over continuous spaces is important, because we retain more of the patient's physiological information. Our model is able to learn clinically interpretable treatment policies, similar in important aspects to the treatment policies of physicians. Evaluating our algorithm on past ICU patient data, we find that our model could reduce patient mortality in the hospital by up to 3.6% over observed clinical policies, from a baseline mortality of 13.7%. The learned treatment policies could be used to aid intensive care clinicians in medical decision making and improve the likelihood of patient survival.",0
"""Septic shock is a life-threatening complication that can occur as a result of sepsis, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to severe infection. Despite advancements in treatment options, early diagnosis and effective management remain crucial for improving patient outcomes. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize sepsis treatment plans.  The objective of our study was to develop a continuous state-space model for optimal sepsis treatment using DRL algorithms. We used retrospective data from patients admitted with septic shock at a tertiary care center to construct our models. Our approach involved defining meaningful states based on clinical variables relevant to sepsis management, which were then used as input to our DRL algorithm. Our goal was to find the most effective treatment plan that minimizes mortality while maximizing organ function preservation.  Our results showed promising improvements compared to standard therapy protocols. By utilizing real-time patient data inputs, the AI was able to adjust treatment plans accordingly, allowing for more personalized care tailored to individual patient needs. Additionally, we demonstrated the feasibility of integrating our AI-guided strategy into existing healthcare systems through simulation studies.  Overall, our work represents a step towards providing physicians with powerful tools to guide decision making in managing septic shock patients. Further evaluation of our methodology in prospective randomized controlled trials may lead to better patient outcomes and cost savings.""",1
"Dropout is used as a practical tool to obtain uncertainty estimates in large vision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, a grid-search over the dropout probabilities is necessary - a prohibitive operation with large models, and an impossible one with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved performance and better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments in Bayesian deep learning, we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete masks. Together with a principled optimisation objective, this allows for automatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models, and as a result faster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as more data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant extensively on a range of tasks, and give insights into common practice in the field where larger dropout probabilities are often used in deeper model layers.",0

"We propose a general framework for entropy-regularized average-reward reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our approach is based on extending the linear-programming formulation of policy optimization in MDPs to accommodate convex regularization functions. Our key result is showing that using the conditional entropy of the joint state-action distributions as regularization yields a dual optimization problem closely resembling the Bellman optimality equations. This result enables us to formalize a number of state-of-the-art entropy-regularized reinforcement learning algorithms as approximate variants of Mirror Descent or Dual Averaging, and thus to argue about the convergence properties of these methods. In particular, we show that the exact version of the TRPO algorithm of Schulman et al. (2015) actually converges to the optimal policy, while the entropy-regularized policy gradient methods of Mnih et al. (2016) may fail to converge to a fixed point. Finally, we illustrate empirically the effects of using various regularization techniques on learning performance in a simple reinforcement learning setup.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using Markov decision processes (MDPs) as a tool for solving complex decision making problems. One challenge faced by researchers working on MDPs is that these models often struggle with state explosion, which occurs when the number of possible states becomes too large for the model to handle effectively. To address this issue, many researchers have turned to techniques such as entropy regularization. Entropy regularization adds a penalty term based on the Shannon entropy of the policy to the objective function, resulting in policies that minimize the expected cumulative reward while also maximizing uncertainty. While previous work has focused on using entropy regularization with either stochastic policies or deterministic policies, we take a different approach. We propose a novel framework that allows us to use entropy regularization with any type of policy, whether it be stochastic or deterministic. Our proposed method introduces a new regularizer called Tsallis entropy that generalizes both the standard Shannon entropy and Renyi entropy. By utilizing this regularizer, our framework can improve the performance of MDPs, especially in high-dimensional spaces where traditional methods may fail due to poor exploration. Additionally, through numerical experiments we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across several tasks including robotics, control systems, finance, and healthcare. Overall, our work provides a more robust solution to the problem of state explosion and demonstrates how entropy regularization can lead to better decision making in real-world applications.",1
"Online reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly popular for the personalized mobile health (mHealth) intervention. It is able to personalize the type and dose of interventions according to user's ongoing statuses and changing needs. However, at the beginning of online learning, there are usually too few samples to support the RL updating, which leads to poor performances. A delay in good performance of the online learning algorithms can be especially detrimental in the mHealth, where users tend to quickly disengage with the mHealth app. To address this problem, we propose a new online RL methodology that focuses on an effective warm start. The main idea is to make full use of the data accumulated and the decision rule achieved in a former study. As a result, we can greatly enrich the data size at the beginning of online learning in our method. Such case accelerates the online learning process for new users to achieve good performances not only at the beginning of online learning but also through the whole online learning process. Besides, we use the decision rules achieved in a previous study to initialize the parameter in our online RL model for new users. It provides a good initialization for the proposed online RL algorithm. Experiment results show that promising improvements have been achieved by our method compared with the state-of-the-art method.",0
"This research presents an effective warm start approach for online actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms used in mobile health (mHealth) interventions.

Our experiments on real-world datasets show significant improvements compared to baseline methods that lack a warm start mechanism, highlighting the effectiveness and potential impact of our approach. We discuss the implications of these findings for future work in developing intelligent agents for mHealth applications.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods have performed well in an increasing numbering of high-dimensional visual decision making domains. Among all such visual decision making problems, those with discrete action spaces often tend to have underlying compositional structure in the said action space. Such action spaces often contain actions such as go left, go up as well as go diagonally up and left (which is a composition of the former two actions). The representations of control policies in such domains have traditionally been modeled without exploiting this inherent compositional structure in the action spaces. We propose a new learning paradigm, Factored Action space Representations (FAR) wherein we decompose a control policy learned using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm into independent components, analogous to decomposing a vector in terms of some orthogonal basis vectors. This architectural modification of the control policy representation allows the agent to learn about multiple actions simultaneously, while executing only one of them. We demonstrate that FAR yields considerable improvements on top of two DRL algorithms in Atari 2600: FARA3C outperforms A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic) in 9 out of 14 tasks and FARAQL outperforms AQL (Asynchronous n-step Q-Learning) in 9 out of 13 tasks.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), finding efficient representations of action spaces is crucial for scalability, interpretability, and sample efficiency. Traditional approaches often represent actions as one hot vectors, resulting in large action spaces that can lead to high dimensional state spaces and slow convergence rates. This study proposes a novel approach to factoring policies and action-value functions into low rank matrices, representing continuous actions using only a few parameters. Our method leverages recent advances in linear algebra and deep RL algorithms to efficiently learn factorized representations of action-value functions and policies. We show that these representations significantly improve sample complexity while achieving comparable performance on benchmark control tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our framework provides interpretable insights into learned factors that control different aspects of agent behavior. Overall, our work shows that incorporating structured representation learning into model architecture design leads to more effective RL agents.",1
"Adversarial examples have been shown to exist for a variety of deep learning architectures.

We present a novel method for reducing the number of times adversarial examples need to be injected for a successful attack, based on the value function. We further explore how re-training on random noise and FGSM perturbations affects the resilience against adversarial examples.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can make decisions and take actions based on deep learning algorithms.

This paper explores the nature of adversarial attacks on deep policies and proposes new techniques for detecting and mitigating them. We begin by reviewing existing work on adversarial attacks and discussing how they can cause problems for deep policy models. Next, we present our own research into developing effective methods for identifying and addressing these issues. Our approach involves using a combination of mathematical analysis and simulation to analyze the behavior of deep policy models under different attack scenarios. Through this process, we identify several promising strategies for improving the resilience of these models to adversarial attacks. Overall, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the challenges faced by deep policy models and offer potential solutions for enhancing their reliability and effectiveness.",1
"We propose a novel framework for efficient parallelization of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling these algorithms to learn from multiple actors on a single machine. The framework is algorithm agnostic and can be applied to on-policy, off-policy, value based and policy gradient based algorithms. Given its inherent parallelism, the framework can be efficiently implemented on a GPU, allowing the usage of powerful models while significantly reducing training time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by implementing an advantage actor-critic algorithm on a GPU, using on-policy experiences and employing synchronous updates. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Atari domain after only a few hours of training. Our framework thus opens the door for much faster experimentation on demanding problem domains. Our implementation is open-source and is made public at https://github.com/alfredvc/paac",0
"Recent advances in parallel computing have made deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training feasible on large neural networks. This has enabled faster exploration through larger parameter spaces and increased efficiency by reducing sample complexity. In this work, we present two parallel algorithms that further improve upon existing methods: gradient clipping and asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. Our first method uses gradient clipping to avoid singularities in actor updates while scaling up training sizes. This allows us to use higher learning rates without diverging. Gradient clipping maintains stability during sparse credit assignment in high-dimensional action spaces, preventing large updates from accumulating errors. Our second method introduces asynchronous SGD into DRL algorithms to overlap computation with communication. Asynchronous update steps operate independently and exchange messages with a shared model store. With careful scheduling techniques, such as synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, mutexes, atomic variables etc., our algorithm remains stable under non-uniform delays due to data transmission latencies. We evaluate both proposals across several benchmark domains, including continuous control tasks and multi-agent games. Results show consistent improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating their effectiveness at scaling up deep reinforcement learning systems. By combining efficient parallel processing strategies and novel improvements to actor updating rules, these contributions demonstrate how to accelerate progress towards solving more complex sequential decision problems beyond current capabilities. Ultimately, we aim to create intelligent agents that can tackle real-world challenges effectively using artificial intelligence.",1
"This article provides the first survey of computational models of emotion in reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g., homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL.

"Portfolio management is the decision-making process of allocating an amount of fund into different financial investment products. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. This paper presents a model-less convolutional neural network with historic prices of a set of financial assets as its input, outputting portfolio weights of the set. The network is trained with 0.7 years' price data from a cryptocurrency exchange. The training is done in a reinforcement manner, maximizing the accumulative return, which is regarded as the reward function of the network. Backtest trading experiments with trading period of 30 minutes is conducted in the same market, achieving 10-fold returns in 1.8 months' periods.

Results show that our method outperforms benchmark strategies such as buy-and-hold, moving average and coin picking in terms of cumulative return. Furthermore, our agent learns to make trades dynamically based on market conditions without relying on fixed rules or threshold values. This work opens up new possibilities in automating trading decisions and improving investment performance for individual investors and institutional clients alike. Keywords: cryptocurrency; deep reinforcement learning; portfolio management. This research investigates using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to manage cryptocurrency portfolios. Since many individuals are attracted by the potential high returns of virtual assets but lack knowledge or time required for continuous monitoring, our goal is to develop a DNN capable of making automatic transactions in multiple coins under different market conditions. We explore different design choices and their impacts on overall profitability before assessing our agent against well established baselines like passive long holding or simple momentum following.

"In recent years, meta reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for developing intelligent agents that can quickly learn new tasks by leveraging knowledge gained from previous experiences. One major challenge faced by existing model-free RL methods is their tendency to overfit to specific task distributions, which can result in poor generalization performance on previously unseen tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep episodic value iteration algorithm for model-based meta-reinforcement learning. Our method uses a learned state representation to encode each experience into a compact latent space, enabling efficient memory storage and retrieval of past episodes. We then use these stored experiences to improve the accuracy of the agent's value function predictions, leading to better policy optimization and improved generalization performance across a diverse range of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming several strong baselines on standard benchmark problems. Overall, our work advances the state of the art in meta-RL and highlights the potential benefits of incorporating episodic memory and state representations into meta-learning algorithms.",1
"There has been a recent explosion in the capabilities of game-playing artificial intelligence. Many classes of RL tasks, from Atari games to motor control to board games, are now solvable by fairly generic algorithms, based on deep learning, that learn to play from experience with minimal knowledge of the specific domain of interest. In this work, we will investigate the performance of these methods on Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM), a popular console fighting game. The SSBM environment has complex dynamics and partial observability, making it challenging for human and machine alike. The multi-player aspect poses an additional challenge, as the vast majority of recent advances in RL have focused on single-agent environments. Nonetheless, we will show that it is possible to train agents that are competitive against and even surpass human professionals, a new result for the multi-player video game setting.",0
"Recent work has shown that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can achieve superhuman performance on challenging games such as Go, chess, and Starcraft II. However, these tasks have very different characteristics than real-time action games like Super Smash Bros., which poses significant challenges for traditional DRL algorithms due to their high-dimensional continuous state spaces and delayed rewards. In this paper we present a novel framework called AlphaSSB (Alpha for Super Smash Bros.) that overcomes these challenges by leveraging both offline training data generated from human expert play and online adaptations made during self-play using deep neural networks. Our method achieves highly competitive results, surpassing top performing amateur players on several rule sets and outperforming previous RL approaches specifically designed for the game. We showcase our approach's effectiveness through extensive experimentation across multiple platforms and rulesets.

"Many machine learning systems are built to solve the hardest examples of a particular task, which often makes them large and expensive to run---especially with respect to the easier examples, which might require much less computation. For an agent with a limited computational budget, this ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may result in the agent wasting valuable computation on easy examples, while not spending enough on hard examples. Rather than learning a single, fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller which learns to optimize a sequence of ""imagined"" internal simulations over predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each iteration. The models (which we call ""experts"") can be state transition models, action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel with the metacontroller. When the metacontroller, controller, and experts were trained with ""interaction networks"" (Battaglia et al., 2016) as expert models, our approach was able to solve a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics. The metacontroller learned to adapt the amount of computation it performed to the difficulty of the task, and learned how to choose which experts to consult by factoring in both their reliability and individual computational resource costs. This allowed the metacontroller to achieve a lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than more traditional fixed policy approaches. These results demonstrate that our approach is a powerful framework for using...",0
"In many real-world optimization problems, finding a global optimum solution can be challenging due to nonlinearity, multi-modalities, and noisy or complex objective functions. One approach that has shown promise in tackling these difficulties is imagination-based optimization (IB), which uses heuristics inspired by human creativity to search for solutions. However, IB methods still face limitations, such as getting stuck at local optima, struggling to balance exploration vs. exploitation, and requiring handcrafted strategies for different problems. To address these issues, we propose metacontrol for adaptive imagination-based optimization, where a high-level controller selects between multiple imaginative search techniques based on problem characteristics and progress made during the search process. Our method integrates several successful IB algorithms into one framework and improves upon them through adaptivity and self-awareness mechanisms. Experimental results on benchmark problems show that our approach outperforms classical stochastic search methods and existing IBM variants across a range of search scenarios. Overall, metacontrol for adaptive imagination-based optimization represents a significant step forward towards developing more effective and flexible optimizers for real-world applications.",1
"We propose a new approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) based on the deep Gaussian process (deep GP) model, which is capable of learning complicated reward structures with few demonstrations. Our model stacks multiple latent GP layers to learn abstract representations of the state feature space, which is linked to the demonstrations through the Maximum Entropy learning framework. Incorporating the IRL engine into the nonlinear latent structure renders existing deep GP inference approaches intractable. To tackle this, we develop a non-standard variational approximation framework which extends previous inference schemes. This allows for approximate Bayesian treatment of the feature space and guards against overfitting. Carrying out representation and inverse reinforcement learning simultaneously within our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, as we demonstrate with experiments on standard benchmarks (""object world"",""highway driving"") and a new benchmark (""binary world"").",0

"We analyze how the knowledge to autonomously handle one type of intersection, represented as a Deep Q-Network, translates to other types of intersections (tasks). We view intersection handling as a deep reinforcement learning problem, which approximates the state action Q function as a deep neural network. Using a traffic simulator, we show that directly copying a network trained for one type of intersection to another type of intersection decreases the success rate. We also show that when a network that is pre-trained on Task A and then is fine-tuned on a Task B, the resulting network not only performs better on the Task B than an network exclusively trained on Task A, but also retained knowledge on the Task A. Finally, we examine a lifelong learning setting, where we train a single network on five different types of intersections sequentially and show that the resulting network exhibited catastrophic forgetting of knowledge on previous tasks. This result suggests a need for a long-term memory component to preserve knowledge.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used increasingly more as an alternative approach to traditional rule-based control systems for traffic management at intersections. DQLs have shown promising results by reducing waiting times at intersections while ensuring safety levels equivalent to those achieved using conventional methods. Our goal in writing this paper is to investigate how knowledge can be effectively transferred across multiple DQL agents in order to improve their performance even further. We focus on transferring the learnt experience from one agent controlling one intersection to another that controls an adjacent intersection, thus enabling both agents to benefit from each other’s experiences. Specifically, we analyze two types of transfer mechanisms: explicit policy initialization and implicit reward shaping. While these transfer approaches provide different tradeoffs in terms of speed of convergence and stability of the resulting system, they both contribute significantly towards improving the overall efficiency of autonomous intersection management in real world scenarios.",1

Using our tools we reveal that the features learned by DQNs aggregate the state space in a hierarchical fashion, explaining its success. Moreover, we are able to understand and describe the policies learned by DQNs for three different Atari2600 games and suggest ways to interpret, debug and optimize deep neural networks in reinforcement learning.",0
"Title: Unraveling Deep Q-Networks: Explaining how they work and why they succeed  Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance across several domains, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models like Deep Q-networks (DQNs) remain opaque and difficult to interpret. Consequently, while these models have revolutionized the field, there remains a gap in our understanding of how DQNs achieve such high levels of success. In this paper, we aim to fill that gap by providing insights into both the mechanisms driving DQNs and their limitations. Our analysis uncovers several key factors contributing to the effectiveness of DQNs, including their neural network architecture and training dynamics, as well as their ability to handle delayed rewards and noisy feedback. By investigating these underlying principles, we can better comprehend the behavior of DQL models and guide future research towards developing more transparent, human-interpretable agents. This study constitutes an important step toward demystifying deep learning algorithms in reinforcement learning settings, thus enabling practitioners, educators, and policymakers to make informed decisions regarding the deployment of these powerful tools in real-world applications. Overall, our work illuminates the inner workings of DQNs, thereby advancing the quest for explainability in deep learning systems.",1
"While a large body of empirical results show that temporally-extended actions and options may significantly affect the learning performance of an agent, the theoretical understanding of how and when options can be beneficial in online reinforcement learning is relatively limited. In this paper, we derive an upper and lower bound on the regret of a variant of UCRL using options. While we first analyze the algorithm in the general case of semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs), we show how these results can be translated to the specific case of MDPs with options and we illustrate simple scenarios in which the regret of learning with options can be \textit{provably} much smaller than the regret suffered when learning with primitive actions.",0
"One of the key challenges facing agents operating in uncertain and complex environments is striking a balance between exploring new actions and exploiting already known effective strategies. In the context of Markov decision processes (MDPs), exploration-exploitation tradeoffs have been studied extensively, but they become even more important in situations where options provide additional flexibility to modify behavior based on current state observations. This work proposes novel algorithmic approaches that combine option discovery with efficient exploration-exploitation methods, enabling agents to make better use of available information while minimizing regret. We introduce two distinct algorithms: one based on upper confidence bounds, and another leveraging Thompson sampling in combination with learned options. Our analysis shows that both proposed methods significantly outperform several baseline approaches across diverse problem domains, demonstrating their effectiveness at managing risk and uncertainty. Additionally, we analyze how different aspects of our framework contribute to overall performance, providing valuable insights into designing next-generation exploration-exploitation algorithms with learning options.

"Image captioning is a challenging problem owing to the complexity in understanding the image content and diverse ways of describing it in natural language. Recent advances in deep neural networks have substantially improved the performance of this task. Most state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework, which generates captions using a sequential recurrent prediction model. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for image captioning. We utilize a ""policy network"" and a ""value network"" to collaboratively generate captions. The policy network serves as a local guidance by providing the confidence of predicting the next word according to the current state. Additionally, the value network serves as a global and lookahead guidance by evaluating all possible extensions of the current state. In essence, it adjusts the goal of predicting the correct words towards the goal of generating captions similar to the ground truth captions. We train both networks using an actor-critic reinforcement learning model, with a novel reward defined by visual-semantic embedding. Extensive experiments and analyses on the Microsoft COCO dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across different evaluation metrics.",0

"State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms often achieve efficiency by making discrete choices about which hypotheses to explore next.

We formulate the problem as a sequential decision making task where each step chooses one image and obtains feedback based on the accuracy of estimated poses. To optimize our policy within the defined search space, we apply Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which has been shown effective in continuous control tasks. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving higher accuracy with faster inference speed and lower computational costs. Furthermore, evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate robustness across different categories and scenes. Our work contributes to efficient RL solutions in computer vision applications, promoting automation and accessibility to resource-constrained systems.",1
"Deep learning and reinforcement learning methods have recently been used to solve a variety of problems in continuous control domains. An obvious application of these techniques is dexterous manipulation tasks in robotics which are difficult to solve using traditional control theory or hand-engineered approaches. One example of such a task is to grasp an object and precisely stack it on another. Solving this difficult and practically relevant problem in the real world is an important long-term goal for the field of robotics. Here we take a step towards this goal by examining the problem in simulation and providing models and techniques aimed at solving it. We introduce two extensions to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG), a model-free Q-learning based method, which make it significantly more data-efficient and scalable. Our results show that by making extensive use of off-policy data and replay, it is possible to find control policies that robustly grasp objects and stack them. Further, our results hint that it may soon be feasible to train successful stacking policies by collecting interactions on real robots.",0
"This is an interesting research paper that presents a novel approach to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that enables more efficient training while preserving the high performance achievable by traditional methods. The authors introduce data recycling strategies inspired from human feedback, which allow agents trained using these strategies to perform at least as well as those trained without them on several manipulation tasks. These results suggest that incorporating human guidance during training could improve agent performance without requiring additional interactions and suggests ways humans can guide learning algorithms beyond simply providing data to learn from.",1
"In this paper we introduce a fully end-to-end approach for visual tracking in videos that learns to predict the bounding box locations of a target object at every frame. An important insight is that the tracking problem can be considered as a sequential decision-making process and historical semantics encode highly relevant information for future decisions. Based on this intuition, we formulate our model as a recurrent convolutional neural network agent that interacts with a video overtime, and our model can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to learn good tracking policies that pay attention to continuous, inter-frame correlation and maximize tracking performance in the long run. The proposed tracking algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in an existing tracking benchmark and operates at frame-rates faster than real-time. To the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the first neural-network tracker that combines convolutional and recurrent networks with RL algorithms.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex tasks across multiple domains. One such domain is computer vision, where tracking objects in videos poses significant challenges due to factors like motion blur, occlusion, lighting changes, and varying backgrounds. To address these issues, researchers have developed a variety of approaches using traditional machine learning techniques, but these methods often suffer from limitations such as high computational complexity and limited robustness.  In our work, we propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning for visual object tracking in videos. By combining deep neural networks with reinforcement learning algorithms, we can learn effective policies that adapt to changing environments and improve over time. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and speed.  Our key contributions lie in three main areas: (i) We introduce a new architecture based on the successive refinement concept, which iteratively improves predictions by incorporating additional evidence; (ii) we develop a reward function that encourages smooth trajectories, accurate boundaries, and stability in the presence of distractors; and (iii) we utilize advanced training techniques such as semi-supervised learning and meta learning to enhance generalization performance under different settings.  Overall, our work represents an important step forward in understanding how deep reinforcement learning can be used for real-world applications like video analysis and surveillance systems. While there remain many opportunities for improvement, our methodology holds great promise for further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning from their mistakes. Despite its perceived utility, it has not yet been successfully applied in automotive applications. Motivated by the successful demonstrations of learning of Atari games and Go by Google DeepMind, we propose a framework for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular relevance as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem due to strong interactions with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As it is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we provide a short overview of deep reinforcement learning and then describe our proposed framework. It incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks for information integration, enabling the car to handle partially observable scenarios. It also integrates the recent work on attention models to focus on relevant information, thereby reducing the computational complexity for deployment on embedded hardware. The framework was tested in an open source 3D car racing simulator called TORCS. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction of other vehicles.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex sequential decision making problems in various domains, including autonomous driving. This paper presents a novel DRL framework that enables autonomous vehicles to learn from real-world interactions with their environment. Our approach leverages deep neural networks to represent both value functions and policies, which allows us to handle high-dimensional state spaces and capture nonlinear relationships between states, actions, and rewards. We use a hierarchical model architecture, where low-level controllers generate subgoals such as steering angles and throttle positions, while a high-level planner coordinates these actions over time to achieve global objectives like reaching a destination or following traffic rules. We evaluate our framework on several simulated benchmark tasks involving driving in challenging scenarios such as congested city streets, roundabouts, and freeways. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of sample efficiency and overall performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Our work highlights the potential of using DRL for enabling safe and efficient autonomous driving systems in unstructured environments.",1
"Policy gradient methods have been successfully applied to many complex reinforcement learning problems. However, policy gradient methods suffer from high variance, slow convergence, and inefficient exploration. In this work, we introduce a maximum entropy policy optimization framework which explicitly encourages parameter exploration, and show that this framework can be reduced to a Bayesian inference problem. We then propose a novel Stein variational policy gradient method (SVPG) which combines existing policy gradient methods and a repulsive functional to generate a set of diverse but well-behaved policies. SVPG is robust to initialization and can easily be implemented in a parallel manner. On continuous control problems, we find that implementing SVPG on top of REINFORCE and advantage actor-critic algorithms improves both average return and data efficiency.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm called Stein Variational Policy Gradient (SVPG) that combines the advantages of variational inference and policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. SVPG estimates both the agent's behavior policy and value function using variational inference techniques, which allows us to compute higher moments of these distributions and use them directly in our update rules. We show how to derive SVPG from first principles, provide experimental results comparing it to state-of-the art algorithms on benchmark problems, and discuss implementation details and potential extensions. Our experiments demonstrate improved performance over existing algorithms, particularly in domains where exploration is important and when we have limited data available.",1
"Policy gradient is an efficient technique for improving a policy in a reinforcement learning setting. However, vanilla online variants are on-policy only and not able to take advantage of off-policy data. In this paper we describe a new technique that combines policy gradient with off-policy Q-learning, drawing experience from a replay buffer. This is motivated by making a connection between the fixed points of the regularized policy gradient algorithm and the Q-values. This connection allows us to estimate the Q-values from the action preferences of the policy, to which we apply Q-learning updates. We refer to the new technique as 'PGQL', for policy gradient and Q-learning. We also establish an equivalency between action-value fitting techniques and actor-critic algorithms, showing that regularized policy gradient techniques can be interpreted as advantage function learning algorithms. We conclude with some numerical examples that demonstrate improved data efficiency and stability of PGQL. In particular, we tested PGQL on the full suite of Atari games and achieved performance exceeding that of both asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and Q-learning.",0
"This could work: Abstract—Combining Policy Gradient & Q-Learning In this paper, we examine how combining policy gradient methods (PGMs) with traditional Q-learning can lead to improved results over either method alone. We compare both PGMs and Q-learning on several problem domains, finding that Q-learning often outperforms PGMs in terms of convergence speed but suffers from high variance in performance. On the other hand, while PGMs converge more slowly than Q-learning on average, they tend to produce policies with higher quality state representations, allowing them to find better solutions. In order to exploit these benefits without losing the advantageous properties of each algorithm, we introduce a hybrid approach that uses both algorithms together. Our experiments show that this combined system produces policies as good or better than those found by using each individual method independently. Additionally, our approach may provide valuable insights into understanding the inner workings of deep learning systems in general and RL systems specifically. Our main contribution lies in showing that integrating two distinct approaches towards learning value functions can lead to significantly improved agent performance and better qualities of learned internal models across multiple problems.",1
"It is well known that options can make planning more efficient, among their many benefits. Thus far, algorithms for autonomously discovering a set of useful options were heuristic. Naturally, a principled way of finding a set of useful options may be more promising and insightful. In this paper we suggest a mathematical characterization of good sets of options using tools from information theory. This characterization enables us to find conditions for a set of options to be optimal and an algorithm that outputs a useful set of options and illustrate the proposed algorithm in simulation.",0
"This abstract describes recent work on principled option learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). The standard solution approach to MDPs involves finding policies that maximize expected cumulative reward. In contrast, options represent temporally extended actions that can capture more complex behavior strategies than basic policies. Options provide higher level abstractions that allow agents to make decisions based on their current situation instead of blindly following predefined rules. However, option discovery remains challenging due to large state spaces and uninformed exploration requirements. To address these issues, we propose a novel algorithm called OPTION that leverages online planning techniques for efficient option learning. Our method focuses on finding optimal options under a variety of constraints including complexity, informativity, generality, and consistency. We show through extensive experiments that our algorithm significantly outperforms traditional heuristics-based methods in terms of both efficiency and quality of discovered options. Overall, our work provides a significant step forward towards enabling intelligent agents to learn effective options from complex environments.",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, perform poorly in the early stages of learning in noisy environments, because much effort is spent unlearning biased estimates of the state-action value function. The bias results from selecting, among several noisy estimates, the apparent optimum, which may actually be suboptimal. We propose G-learning, a new off-policy learning algorithm that regularizes the value estimates by penalizing deterministic policies in the beginning of the learning process. We show that this method reduces the bias of the value-function estimation, leading to faster convergence to the optimal value and the optimal policy. Moreover, G-learning enables the natural incorporation of prior domain knowledge, when available. The stochastic nature of G-learning also makes it avoid some exploration costs, a property usually attributed only to on-policy algorithms. We illustrate these ideas in several examples, where G-learning results in significant improvements of the convergence rate and the cost of the learning process.",0
"Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of ""noisy"" rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), where the true reward signal received by the agent can differ from the intended one due to factors such as measurement uncertainty or adversarial attacks. We propose soft updates, a novel algorithm that smooths out large changes in policy parameters over time, as a solution to tame excessive exploration caused by noisy rewards. Our approach works by maintaining multiple running estimates of the current policy parameter values and gradually transitioning towards new value assignments based on recent experience. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method improves performance across several benchmark domains compared to existing techniques. In addition, we show how our framework naturally extends to handle nonlinear function approximation and provide theoretical analysis that characterizes soft updates under different conditions. Overall, our work contributes a powerful toolset to stabilize RL training and enhance robustness against uncertainties and malicious interventions.",1
"In this paper, we propose a framework for solving a single-agent task by using multiple agents, each focusing on different aspects of the task. This approach has two main advantages: 1) it allows for training specialized agents on different parts of the task, and 2) it provides a new way to transfer knowledge, by transferring trained agents. Our framework generalizes the traditional hierarchical decomposition, in which, at any moment in time, a single agent has control until it has solved its particular subtask. We illustrate our framework with empirical experiments on two domains.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in applying deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real world problems, such as robot control, game playing, and autonomous driving. One key challenge facing RL practitioners is how to design effective state representations that capture relevant aspects of the problem at hand, while remaining tractable enough for large scale training and inference on modern hardware. This paper presents a method for separating concerns in state representation design by decomposing high level concepts into simpler pieces, each corresponding to one aspect of the environment modelled by the agent. We show that agents equipped with these learned separate state spaces can achieve higher quality solutions faster compared to traditional single global feature space approaches, demonstrating both qualitative and quantitative benefits across several challenging continuous control benchmark tasks. Our results suggest that the separation of concerns approach opens up new possibilities for building powerful RL models in complex domains.",1
"We consider the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in linear quadratic (LQ) control problems, where the state dynamics is linear and the cost function is quadratic in states and controls. We analyze the regret of Thompson sampling (TS) (a.k.a. posterior-sampling for reinforcement learning) in the frequentist setting, i.e., when the parameters characterizing the LQ dynamics are fixed. Despite the empirical and theoretical success in a wide range of problems from multi-armed bandit to linear bandit, we show that when studying the frequentist regret TS in control problems, we need to trade-off the frequency of sampling optimistic parameters and the frequency of switches in the control policy. This results in an overall regret of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is significantly worse than the regret $O(\sqrt{T})$ achieved by the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty algorithm in LQ control problems.",0
"Thompson sampling (TS) has emerged as one of the most popular choice methods due to its strong theoretical foundations and excellent performance on real-world tasks. However, little research has focused on applying TS to linear-quadratic control problems. In this study, we propose Thompson Sampling for Linear Quadratic Control Problems (TSLQCP), which adaptively selects actions by probabilistically following the current belief over the unknown system parameters. We prove that under mild assumptions, TSLQCP achieves near optimal regret rates even though the original problem might possess poor convexity properties. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques for LQ control problems, including both model-based approaches and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. Our work highlights the potential benefits of combining classical control theory with modern machine learning algorithms such as Thompson Sampling, opening up exciting opportunities for future research at the intersection of these fields.",1
"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) has become a useful tool for learning behavioral models from demonstration data. However, IRL remains mostly unexplored for multi-agent systems. In this paper, we show how the principle of IRL can be extended to homogeneous large-scale problems, inspired by the collective swarming behavior of natural systems. In particular, we make the following contributions to the field: 1) We introduce the swarMDP framework, a sub-class of decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes endowed with a swarm characterization. 2) Exploiting the inherent homogeneity of this framework, we reduce the resulting multi-agent IRL problem to a single-agent one by proving that the agent-specific value functions in this model coincide. 3) To solve the corresponding control problem, we propose a novel heterogeneous learning scheme that is particularly tailored to the swarm setting. Results on two example systems demonstrate that our framework is able to produce meaningful local reward models from which we can replicate the observed global system dynamics.",0
"In this study, we explore the potential applications of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in swarm systems. We begin by discussing the fundamental principles behind IRL and how it differs from traditional reinforcement learning approaches. Then, we present several case studies that demonstrate how IRL can be used to improve the performance of swarm systems in complex environments. Finally, we conclude by outlining future research directions and highlighting some of the key challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize the benefits of IRL in swarm systems. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the importance of developing algorithms that are both efficient and effective at identifying and exploiting patterns in human behavior. By doing so, we hope to inspire further innovation in this exciting field of study.",1
"At present, designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures requires both human expertise and labor. New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to designing neural network architectures using reinforcement learning (RL). Traditionally, architecture search has been done through trial-and-error, manual tuning by human experts, or using random search methods that lack efficiency and guidance. We propose the use of RL as a method to efficiently explore large spaces of possible architectures and find high-performing solutions quickly. Our method uses a hierarchical multi-agent system where each agent learns to generate promising neural network candidates based on feedback from lower-level agents who evaluate candidate architectures on specific tasks. To train our agents, we introduce new objective functions based on both task accuracy and computational cost metrics that guide the exploration of the architecture space towards efficient solutions. In summary, our results show the feasibility and promise of using RL to effectively automate the process of designing complex models that perform well across multiple benchmarks while satisfying constraints such as computational cost or parameter count.",1
"We propose an end-to-end approach to the natural language object retrieval task, which localizes an object within an image according to a natural language description, i.e., referring expression. Previous works divide this problem into two independent stages: first, compute region proposals from the image without the exploration of the language description; second, score the object proposals with regard to the referring expression and choose the top-ranked proposals. The object proposals are generated independently from the referring expression, which makes the proposal generation redundant and even irrelevant to the referred object. In this work, we train an agent with deep reinforcement learning, which learns to move and reshape a bounding box to localize the object according to the referring expression. We incorporate both the spatial and temporal context information into the training procedure. By simultaneously exploiting local visual information, the spatial and temporal context and the referring language a priori, the agent selects an appropriate action to take at each time. A special action is defined to indicate when the agent finds the referred object, and terminate the procedure. We evaluate our model on various datasets, and our algorithm significantly outperforms the compared algorithms. Notably, the accuracy improvement of our method over the recent method GroundeR and SCRC on the ReferItGame dataset are 7.67% and 18.25%, respectively.",0
"Title: ""Deep Reinforcement Learning for Natural Language Object Retrieval""  The ability to retrieve objects mentioned in natural language descriptions has many potential applications, including question answering systems, virtual assistants, and content retrieval from databases. Traditional methods rely on preprocessing steps such as object detection, named entity recognition, and semantic reasoning, but these can often suffer from errors and omissions. In contrast, deep learning approaches have shown promise in automatically integrating visual representations with textual semantics to achieve more accurate results without relying on explicit intermediate representations.  In this work, we present an end-to-end approach to natural language object retrieval using context-aware deep reinforcement learning. Our model learns to predict visually grounded concepts directly from raw image pixels and natural language prompts without any handcrafted features or linguistic components. We train our system using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques that take into account both short-term and long-term context during inference. This allows us to handle complex queries involving multiple entities and relations while minimizing error propagation over time.  Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets, achieving new records in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. We showcase some real-world examples where our system can quickly find specific items within cluttered scenes based solely on verbal requests. Overall, our study contributes to advancing the field of multimodal processing by leveraging deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve challenging problems at the intersection of computer vision and natural language understanding.",1
"We introduce the first goal-driven training for visual question answering and dialog agents. Specifically, we pose a cooperative 'image guessing' game between two agents -- Qbot and Abot -- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.   We demonstrate two experimental results.   First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.   Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset, where we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned' agents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to ask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.",0
"This is a research paper that presents a method for training visual dialog agents using deep reinforcement learning. The goal of the agent is to engage in cooperative conversation with humans by answering questions and providing relevant information. To achieve this, the authors propose a novel model that leverages both supervised and unsupervised pretraining techniques, allowing the agent to effectively learn from large amounts of data without direct human annotation. Additionally, they use a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards to guide the agent’s behavior during interaction, ensuring that it maximizes user satisfaction while minimizing errors. The results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods, with the trained agent outperforming state-of-the-art systems on several benchmark datasets. Overall, this work represents a significant step towards developing more advanced conversational agents capable of complex interactions with humans.",1
"Fine-grained recognition is challenging due to its subtle local inter-class differences versus large intra-class variations such as poses. A key to address this problem is to localize discriminative parts to extract pose-invariant features. However, ground-truth part annotations can be expensive to acquire. Moreover, it is hard to define parts for many fine-grained classes. This work introduces Fully Convolutional Attention Networks (FCANs), a reinforcement learning framework to optimally glimpse local discriminative regions adaptive to different fine-grained domains. Compared to previous methods, our approach enjoys three advantages: 1) the weakly-supervised reinforcement learning procedure requires no expensive part annotations; 2) the fully-convolutional architecture speeds up both training and testing; 3) the greedy reward strategy accelerates the convergence of the learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on four challenging fine-grained benchmark datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars and Food-101.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to focus on selective regions while performing dense predictions at multiple scales. Our method adopts spatial attention mechanisms to guide the network to focus on different objects of interest across varying distances. We term our framework as ""Fully Convolutional Attention Networks"" (FCAN), which unifies feature extraction and multi-scale prediction into one coherent architecture. This allows FCAN to perform fine-grained recognition tasks with improved accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability over prior methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on challenging benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, CUB-200-2011, and NABirds. Our contributions can potentially facilitate future research in computer vision by bridging the gap between localization and classification models, thus enabling end-to-end training of high-performance object detection systems.",1
"Dexterous multi-fingered hands can accomplish fine manipulation behaviors that are infeasible with simple robotic grippers. However, sophisticated multi-fingered hands are often expensive and fragile. Low-cost soft hands offer an appealing alternative to more conventional devices, but present considerable challenges in sensing and actuation, making them difficult to apply to more complex manipulation tasks. In this paper, we describe an approach to learning from demonstration that can be used to train soft robotic hands to perform dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method uses object-centric demonstrations, where a human demonstrates the desired motion of manipulated objects with their own hands, and the robot autonomously learns to imitate these demonstrations using reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm that allows us to blend and select a subset of the most feasible demonstrations to learn to imitate on the hardware, which we use with an extension of the guided policy search framework to use multiple demonstrations to learn generalizable neural network policies. We demonstrate our approach on the RBO Hand 2, with learned motor skills for turning a valve, manipulating an abacus, and grasping.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning dexterous manipulation tasks using human demonstrations and applying them to a soft robotic hand.

"Mobile edge computing (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to enable in-situ processing of delay-sensitive applications at the edge of mobile networks. Providing grid power supply in support of mobile edge computing, however, is costly and even infeasible (in certain rugged or under-developed areas), thus mandating on-site renewable energy as a major or even sole power supply in increasingly many scenarios. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and unpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high quality of service to users in energy harvesting mobile edge computing systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile edge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource management algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic workload offloading (to the centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to minimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and operational cost). Our online learning algorithm uses a decomposition of the (offline) value iteration and (online) reinforcement learning, thus achieving a significant improvement of learning rate and run-time performance when compared to standard reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and analytically show that the learned policy has a simple monotone structure amenable to practical implementation. Our simulation results validate the efficacy of our algorithm, which significantly improves the edge computing performance compared to fixed or myopic optimization schemes and conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.",0
"Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology that enables the execution of computationally intensive tasks on mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. MEC offloads compute-intensive applications from the cloud by executing them at the network's edge, which reduces latency and improves resource utilization. However, one major challenge faced by MEC systems is that they operate under limited energy resources due to their reliance on battery power. To address this issue, we propose an online learning framework for dynamic task assignment and server scaling in energy harvesting MEC networks. Our approach uses machine learning algorithms to predict future task arrival rates, channel conditions, and energy availability, allowing the system to make informed decisions regarding task offloading, autoscaling, and resource allocation. We evaluate our proposed scheme through simulations and demonstrate that it achieves significant improvements in terms of resource efficiency, task completion time, and overall performance compared to baseline approaches. This work provides new insights into how to design efficient and adaptive MEC systems that can effectively handle uncertain environments while minimizing energy consumption.",1
"The policy gradients of the expected return objective can react slowly to rare rewards. Yet, in some cases agents may wish to emphasize the low or high returns regardless of their probability. Borrowing from the economics and control literature, we review the risk-sensitive value function that arises from an exponential utility and illustrate its effects on an example. This risk-sensitive value function is not always applicable to reinforcement learning problems, so we introduce the particle value function defined by a particle filter over the distributions of an agent's experience, which bounds the risk-sensitive one. We illustrate the benefit of the policy gradients of this objective in Cliffworld.",0

To better bridge the gap between seemingly distinct domains of physics and other disciplines, we engaged researchers representing diverse backgrounds—a novel approach that paid dividends in generating more comprehensive theories.

"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring small modifications to an implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. Our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Our algorithm successfully solves a benchmark multi-digit addition task and generalizes to long sequences. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.",0

"A key challenge in scaling up robot learning to many skills and environments is removing the need for human supervision, so that robots can collect their own data and improve their own performance without being limited by the cost of requesting human feedback. Model-based reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling an agent to learn to predict the effects of its actions, which could provide flexible predictive models for a wide range of tasks and environments, without detailed human supervision. We develop a method for combining deep action-conditioned video prediction models with model-predictive control that uses entirely unlabeled training data.

"In reinforcement learning, the state of the real world is often represented by feature vectors. However, not all of the features may be pertinent for solving the current task. We propose Feature Selection Explore and Exploit (FS-EE), an algorithm that automatically selects the necessary features while learning a Factored Markov Decision Process, and prove that under mild assumptions, its sample complexity scales with the in-degree of the dynamics of just the necessary features, rather than the in-degree of all features. This can result in a much better sample complexity when the in-degree of the necessary features is smaller than the in-degree of all features.",0
"This research presents a methodology for efficient feature selection in large scale Markov decision processes (MDPs) with uncountable state spaces. We focus on factored MDPs, where each factor represents a subset of states that can be updated independently. Our approach builds upon previous work by incorporating domain knowledge into the feature selection process, resulting in a significant reduction in computation time while maintaining performance accuracy. The proposed algorithm iteratively selects features based on their relevance to the problem, using both statistical significance tests and heuristics derived from expertise in the field. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods on a range of real-world applications. Overall, our findings contribute towards building more intelligent systems capable of making informed decisions under uncertainty and limited computational resources.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) can acquire complex behaviors from low-level inputs, such as images. However, real-world applications of such methods require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the world around it, even while deployed. However, this learning requires access to a reward function, which is often hard to measure in real-world domains, where the reward could depend on, for example, unknown positions of objects or the emotional state of the user. Conversely, it is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present or in a controlled setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect on its own? In this paper, we formalize this problem as semisupervised reinforcement learning, where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of ""labeled"" MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of ""unlabeled"" MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent's own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available. We also show that our method outperforms direct supervised learning of the reward.",0
"One potential problem that arises when training reinforcement learning (RL) agents on specific tasks is the limited scope of their skills, often only applicable within narrow domains. Addressing this issue requires methods that can generalize knowledge from few labeled examples while enabling efficient exploration and fine-tuning. In our work, we propose semi-supervised RL as a solution to overcome these challenges by leveraging unlabeled data during policy improvement phases. This approach uses a mixture model of policies as a prior distribution over plausible behaviors, which is refined through self-play. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various continuous control benchmarks such as Acrobot, MountainCar, and LunarLander, achieving substantially better performance than fully supervised approaches. Our results suggest that semi-supervised RL can facilitate broader transfer of learned skills and may serve as a cornerstone in advancing generalization capabilities of artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning optimizes policies for expected cumulative reward. Need the supervision be so narrow? Reward is delayed and sparse for many tasks, making it a difficult and impoverished signal for end-to-end optimization. To augment reward, we consider a range of self-supervised tasks that incorporate states, actions, and successors to provide auxiliary losses. These losses offer ubiquitous and instantaneous supervision for representation learning even in the absence of reward. While current results show that learning from reward alone is feasible, pure reinforcement learning methods are constrained by computational and data efficiency issues that can be remedied by auxiliary losses. Self-supervised pre-training and joint optimization improve the data efficiency and policy returns of end-to-end reinforcement learning.",0
"This research presents an approach to self-supervised reinforcement learning that leverages the concept of loss as a reward signal. Traditional methods for training agents rely on handcrafted rewards or extrinsic motivations such as human feedback or monetary gain. However, these approaches can suffer from limited generalization or scalability across different domains. In contrast, our method enables agents to learn from trial and error by maximizing their progress towards reducing losses. By framing the optimization problem in terms of minimizing loss rather than achieving gains, we show that agents can effectively solve complex tasks without any explicit guidance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques across several benchmark environments and task types, including both continuous and discrete action spaces. Additionally, we provide ablation studies and analysis to shed light into how different components contribute to the overall performance of our model. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the development of autonomous agents capable of learning through unguided exploration.",1
"Despite progress in visual perception tasks such as image classification and detection, computers still struggle to understand the interdependency of objects in the scene as a whole, e.g., relations between objects or their attributes. Existing methods often ignore global context cues capturing the interactions among different object instances, and can only recognize a handful of types by exhaustively training individual detectors for all possible relationships. To capture such global interdependency, we propose a deep Variation-structured Reinforcement Learning (VRL) framework to sequentially discover object relationships and attributes in the whole image. First, a directed semantic action graph is built using language priors to provide a rich and compact representation of semantic correlations between object categories, predicates, and attributes. Next, we use a variation-structured traversal over the action graph to construct a small, adaptive action set for each step based on the current state and historical actions. In particular, an ambiguity-aware object mining scheme is used to resolve semantic ambiguity among object categories that the object detector fails to distinguish. We then make sequential predictions using a deep RL framework, incorporating global context cues and semantic embeddings of previously extracted phrases in the state vector. Our experiments on the Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) dataset and the large-scale Visual Genome dataset validate the superiority of VRL, which can achieve significantly better detection results on datasets involving thousands of relationship and attribute types. We also demonstrate that VRL is able to predict unseen types embedded in our action graph by learning correlations on shared graph nodes.",0
"Abstract: (the title should not appear anywhere except as the label) Recently, deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to detecting relationships and attributes in images using reinforcement learning. In particular, policy gradients methods based on actor critic architectures can effectively learn to predict relationship labels that describe spatial layouts in scenes. To improve performance even further, we introduce variation structures into the reward signal by comparing the agent’s actions against multiple reference policies. Our new method outperforms state of the art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively on several benchmark datasets including VRD, VG++, RSVD and SACE2. Furthermore, our model achieves top rankings on the challenging PASCAL Visual Object Part segmentation task and significantly reduces error rates compared to prior work. We analyze and visualize the learned decision boundaries in latent spaces which provide insights into object affordances and reveal high level concepts such as causality in complex scenes. Finally, we show how to use attribute detection as a surrogate task to pretrain a model for end tasks beyond relationships prediction, enabling better generalization overall. Taken together, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining structured rewards with deep reinforcement learning models, opening up exciting possibilities for tackling other scene understanding problems under uncertainty.",1
"Existing object proposal algorithms usually search for possible object regions over multiple locations and scales separately, which ignore the interdependency among different objects and deviate from the human perception procedure. To incorporate global interdependency between objects into object localization, we propose an effective Tree-structured Reinforcement Learning (Tree-RL) approach to sequentially search for objects by fully exploiting both the current observation and historical search paths. The Tree-RL approach learns multiple searching policies through maximizing the long-term reward that reflects localization accuracies over all the objects. Starting with taking the entire image as a proposal, the Tree-RL approach allows the agent to sequentially discover multiple objects via a tree-structured traversing scheme. Allowing multiple near-optimal policies, Tree-RL offers more diversity in search paths and is able to find multiple objects with a single feed-forward pass. Therefore, Tree-RL can better cover different objects with various scales which is quite appealing in the context of object proposal. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 validate the effectiveness of the Tree-RL, which can achieve comparable recalls with current object proposal algorithms via much fewer candidate windows.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for sequential object localization due to its ability to learn from raw pixels without relying on hand-engineered features or explicit state representations. However, many existing RL approaches suffer from issues such as sample inefficiency and overfitting, which hinder their performance and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose tree-structured RL (TSRL), a novel algorithm that exploits a hierarchical representation of task uncertainty to guide efficient exploration and improve convergence rates. We evaluate our method on three widely used benchmark datasets: DOTA, HRSC2016, and Pixorobot. Our results demonstrate that TSRL outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics, achieving substantial improvements in terms of both accuracy and speed. Overall, our work shows the potential of TSRL as a powerful tool for solving complex real-world problems where efficient exploration and robustness are crucial factors.",1
"Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computation have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced -- that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex decision making problems across diverse domains such as game playing, robotics, and control systems. However, these RL algorithms often struggle with real-world environments where they may encounter unexpected situations or receive incomplete or incorrect information from sensors. As a result, there is a growing interest in developing methods that can make RL agents more robust to adversarial attacks while still allowing them to learn efficiently.  This paper presents a novel framework for adversarial reinforcement learning, which combines techniques from both robust optimization and RL to achieve high performance under uncertainty. Our approach introduces a new class ofrobust reward functions that allow agents to optimize for worst-case scenarios while minimizing regret during exploration. These robust rewards adaptively shape the agent's behavior based on available information and help overcome limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on worst-case assumptions or static ambiguity sets.  Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial RL algorithms in benchmark tasks across several domains, including Atari games and continuous control tasks. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm achieves superior generalization to unseen attack distributions through its ability to maintain consistency with respect to changing levels of adversarial perturbations.  Overall, our work represents an important step towards designing more reliable and robust RL algorithms that can effectively operate in uncertain and adversarial environments. With potential applications ranging from autonomous driving to cybersecurity, the proposed framework offers exciting opportunities for future research at the intersection of machine learning and control theory.",1
"We present an algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning that combines Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with random roll-outs and stochastic optimization for policy learning. The BNNs are trained by minimizing $\alpha$-divergences, allowing us to capture complicated statistical patterns in the transition dynamics, e.g. multi-modality and heteroskedasticity, which are usually missed by other common modeling approaches. We illustrate the performance of our method by solving a challenging benchmark where model-based approaches usually fail and by obtaining promising results in a real-world scenario for controlling a gas turbine.",0

Experimental results on two benchmark testbeds demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to traditional methods used in stochastic optimal control problems. Overall, this work advances the state of the art in machine learning for complex control tasks and shows promise for applications in real-world engineering systems where robustness and reliability are critical design goals.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning methods attain super-human performance in a wide range of environments. Such methods are grossly inefficient, often taking orders of magnitudes more data than humans to achieve reasonable performance. We propose Neural Episodic Control: a deep reinforcement learning agent that is able to rapidly assimilate new experiences and act upon them. Our agent uses a semi-tabular representation of the value function: a buffer of past experience containing slowly changing state representations and rapidly updated estimates of the value function. We show across a wide range of environments that our agent learns significantly faster than other state-of-the-art, general purpose deep reinforcement learning agents.",0

"Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with very sparse rewards. Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents surprise-based intrinsic motivation for deep reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional RL algorithms rely on external rewards which may not always be available in complex real world tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose using intrinsic motivation based on predictive uncertainty measures such as the predictive entropy search (PES) algorithm. PES encourages agents to explore novel situations by maximizing the prediction error of their state representation. We evaluate our approach across multiple benchmark environments including MuJoCo locomotion problems and Atari games. Our experiments show that surprise-based intrinsic motivation significantly improves performance compared to prior methods and achieves results comparable to those obtained from humans. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by incorporating it into several modern RL architectures such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and human level performance has been achieved in some challenging domains like Montezuma’s Revenge. Finally, we provide analysis of learned representations and behaviors to further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Overall, these findings contribute new insights into deep RL and suggest future directions for developing more intelligent artificial intelligence systems capable of handling diverse tasks without explicit guidance.",1

The dataset includes 20,000+ RGB-D images and 50,000+ 2D bounding boxes of object instances densely captured in 9 unique scenes. We train a fast object category detector for instance detection on our data. Using the dataset we show that, although increasingly accurate and fast, the state of the art for object detection is still severely impacted by object scale, occlusion, and viewing direction all of which matter for robotics applications. We next validate the dataset for simulating active vision, and use the dataset to develop and evaluate a deep-network-based system for next best move prediction for object classification using reinforcement learning.

"Sample complexity and safety are major challenges when learning policies with reinforcement learning for real-world tasks, especially when the policies are represented using rich function approximators like deep neural networks. Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in the ensemble can be adapted using data from target domain and approximate Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus, learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the benefit of both robustness and learning/adaptation.",0
"Acknowledging that real-world reinforcement learning problems often contain randomness, unmodeled dynamics, and other sources of uncertainty, we present EPOpt, which trains model ensembles on random subsets of experiences obtained from multiple parallel interacting copies of a policy. In contrast to prior methods that primarily aim at reducing variance by averaging models' predictions, our approach explicitly leverages ensemble diversity to learn more robust policies. Extensive experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that EPOpt improves generalization compared to state-of-the-art baselines while providing significant computational savings. Our results suggest that model ensembling may be used as a building block for efficient RL algorithms, enabling the exploitation of model diversity without sacrificing performance. To address the challenges presented by real-world reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, which often involve randomness and unmodeled dynamics, we introduce EPOpt, a method that uses model ensembles trained on random subsets of experiences from multiple parallel interacting copies of a policy. Unlike previous approaches that focus on reducing variance through model averaging, EPOpt harnesses the diversity within these ensembles to learn more robust neural network policies. We evaluate our approach using extensive experiments across several environments and show that EPOpt outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. These findings indicate that model ensembling can serve as a key component for designing effective and computationally efficient RL algorithms. By utilizing the benefits of model diversity without compromising performance, researchers and practitioners can develop solutions better equipped to handle the complexities of uncertain environments.",1
"We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a \textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an \textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.",0
"This paper presents a novel actor critic algorithm for sequence prediction that improves upon existing approaches by utilizing the advantages of both model-free and model-based reinforcement learning methods.

By introducing a separate critic network which learns an approximation of the state-value function of the system, we are able to improve stability and reduce variance during training. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over several benchmark datasets across different domains, including natural language processing and robotics control tasks. Our approach opens up new possibilities for using deep learning techniques in sequential decision making problems where previous algorithms have struggled due to issues such as overfitting and slow convergence.",1
"Researchers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in sequential decision making problems (e.g., robotics control, sequential prediction) with deep neural network models. One often has access to near-optimal oracles that achieve good performance on the task during training. We demonstrate that AggreVaTeD --- a policy gradient extension of the Imitation Learning (IL) approach of (Ross & Bagnell, 2014) --- can leverage such an oracle to achieve faster and better solutions with less training data than a less-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique. Using both feedforward and recurrent neural network predictors, we present stochastic gradient procedures on a sequential prediction task, dependency-parsing from raw image data, as well as on various high dimensional robotics control problems. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical study of IL that demonstrates we can expect up to exponentially lower sample complexity for learning with AggreVaTeD than with RL algorithms, which backs our empirical findings. Our results and theory indicate that the proposed approach can achieve superior performance with respect to the oracle when the demonstrator is sub-optimal.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that deals with training agents to make decisions in complex, uncertain environments. One popular RL algorithm is advantage actor-critic (A2C), which learns to balance exploration and exploitation by estimating action values using both online updates from Bellman equations and offline updates from batch policy evaluation. In this work, we present asynchronous advantage actor-critic (AA2C), a variant of A2C designed specifically for high performance on graphics processing units (GPUs). AA2C uses asynchronous parallelization, stochastic gradient descent updates, and mini-batch sampling techniques to achieve faster convergence rates while maintaining stability and low sample complexity.

"Machine learning is essentially the sciences of playing with data. An adaptive data selection strategy, enabling to dynamically choose different data at various training stages, can reach a more effective model in a more efficient way. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework, which we call \emph{\textbf{N}eural \textbf{D}ata \textbf{F}ilter} (\textbf{NDF}), to explore automatic and adaptive data selection in the training process. In particular, NDF takes advantage of a deep neural network to adaptively select and filter important data instances from a sequential stream of training data, such that the future accumulative reward (e.g., the convergence speed) is maximized. In contrast to previous studies in data selection that is mainly based on heuristic strategies, NDF is quite generic and thus can be widely suitable for many machine learning tasks. Taking neural network training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as an example, comprehensive experiments with respect to various neural network modeling (e.g., multi-layer perceptron networks, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) and several applications (e.g., image classification and text understanding) demonstrate that NDF powered SGD can achieve comparable accuracy with standard SGD process by using less data and fewer iterations.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to learning from data that addresses one of the fundamental challenges in machine learning: how to select which data to learn from.

By doing so, we can significantly improve performance on a variety of tasks while reducing computational cost. Our approach has been tested extensively on both synthetic datasets and real world problems, demonstrating strong results across a range of domains. Overall, our work offers an exciting new direction for researchers seeking more efficient and effective ways to harness big data resources.",1
"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's MuJoCo continuous control environments.",0

We show that this combination can lead to significant improvement over TRPO on hard exploration problems such as Mountain Car and Acrobot while using very few samples. Our approach outperforms both actor-only and critic-only baselines, highlighting the importance of combining these two perspectives. These results demonstrate the potential of efficient reinforcement learning algorithms that leverage rich function approximators, like deep neural networks, for real-world applications such as robotics and computer vision where sample efficiency is critical.",1
"A critical component to enabling intelligent reasoning in partially observable environments is memory. Despite this importance, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have so far used relatively simple memory architectures, with the main methods to overcome partial observability being either a temporal convolution over the past k frames or an LSTM layer. More recent work (Oh et al., 2016) has went beyond these architectures by using memory networks which can allow more sophisticated addressing schemes over the past k frames. But even these architectures are unsatisfactory due to the reason that they are limited to only remembering information from the last k frames. In this paper, we develop a memory system with an adaptable write operator that is customized to the sorts of 3D environments that DRL agents typically interact with. This architecture, called the Neural Map, uses a spatially structured 2D memory image to learn to store arbitrary information about the environment over long time lags. We demonstrate empirically that the Neural Map surpasses previous DRL memories on a set of challenging 2D and 3D maze environments and show that it is capable of generalizing to environments that were not seen during training.",0

In this work we describe a mixture-of-experts model and show how to change its test-time resource-usage on a per-input basis using reinforcement learning. We test our method on a small MNIST-based example.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems rely on machine learning models to make predictions and take actions based on their output. These models need to generalize well to novel examples outside of the training distribution to perform well in real world scenarios. However, as we scale up model size, data availability, and complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging for traditional evaluation methods to capture performance variability across all possible situations that these models might encounter. One solution could be reinforcement learning (RL), where agents receive rewards or penalties depending on how they behave in different environments. RL has been shown effective in modifying model behavior through shaping the reward function such that desirable behaviors are encouraged while undesirable ones are discouraged. This work presents the application of test time adaptation using RL for image classification tasks. We evaluate two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and show that our proposed method significantly improves average accuracy compared to strong baseline methods without requiring any additional annotations beyond those used during training. Our approach modifies model output probabilities before softmax normalization, allowing us to apply gradient based optimization techniques for efficient policy improvement. Code and trained policies will be made publicly available to further promote research into test time adaption using RL.",1
"The efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms depends critically on a few meta-parameters that modulates the learning updates and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The adaptation of the meta-parameters is an open question in reinforcement learning, which arguably has become more of an issue recently with the success of deep reinforcement learning in high-dimensional state spaces. The long learning times in domains such as Atari 2600 video games makes it not feasible to perform comprehensive searches of appropriate meta-parameter values. We propose the Online Meta-learning by Parallel Algorithm Competition (OMPAC) method. In the OMPAC method, several instances of a reinforcement learning algorithm are run in parallel with small differences in the initial values of the meta-parameters. After a fixed number of episodes, the instances are selected based on their performance in the task at hand. Before continuing the learning, Gaussian noise is added to the meta-parameters with a predefined probability. We validate the OMPAC method by improving the state-of-the-art results in stochastic SZ-Tetris and in standard Tetris with a smaller, 10$\times$10, board, by 31% and 84%, respectively, and by improving the results for deep Sarsa($\lambda$) agents in three Atari 2600 games by 62% or more.

Experimental results demonstrate that OMLPAC outperforms state-of-the art meta-learning methods by achieving better test accuracies under similar compute constraints. Additionally, ablation studies show the efficacy of each component within our approach. As a result, OMLPAC sets new benchmarks for competitive few-shot meta-learning research.",1
"Many modern commercial sites employ recommender systems to propose relevant content to users. While most systems are focused on maximizing the immediate gain (clicks, purchases or ratings), a better notion of success would be the lifetime value (LTV) of the user-system interaction. The LTV approach considers the future implications of the item recommendation, and seeks to maximize the cumulative gain over time. The Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework is the standard formulation for optimizing cumulative successes over time. However, RL is rarely used in practice due to its associated representation, optimization and validation techniques which can be complex. In this paper we propose a new architecture for combining RL with recommendation systems which obviates the need for hand-tuned features, thus automating the state-space representation construction process. We analyze the practical difficulties in this formulation and test our solutions on batch off-line real-world recommendation data.",0
"In today’s competitive marketplace, companies need to accurately predict customer behavior patterns if they want to increase their profits. As a result, many businesses have turned to recommendation systems that use lifetime value (LTV) as a metric for evaluating customer worth. These systems provide customized recommendations designed to improve customer retention rates, which can significantly boost overall company revenues. The effectiveness of these recommender systems depends heavily on how accurately they represent consumer habits over time. Traditional methods rely on static models that fail to take into account changing market conditions, resulting in outdated predictions. To address this issue, our research proposes using dynamic representations based on deep learning techniques that adapt over time. Our approach utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which allow us to capture the evolving nature of customers’ preferences. We demonstrate the superiority of our methodology by comparing its performance against static approaches in simulated scenarios and real datasets from e-commerce websites. Our results show that incorporating lifetime value considerations improves recommendation accuracy by up to 20% compared to traditional static models. Moreover, we found that RNN representations enable more accurate prediction of future purchase intentions even after only two weeks of training data collection, highlighting the robustness of our method. Overall, our findings suggest significant benefits for organizations seeking improved customer loyalty management through automatic LTV recommendation systems. By employing advanced deep learning algorithms capable of handling temporal information, businesses can gain valuable insights into individual customers’ purchasing behaviors, driving increased revenue generation over time.",1
"We consider the problem of learning hierarchical policies for Reinforcement Learning able to discover options, an option corresponding to a sub-policy over a set of primitive actions. Different models have been proposed during the last decade that usually rely on a predefined set of options. We specifically address the problem of automatically discovering options in decision processes. We describe a new learning model called Budgeted Option Neural Network (BONN) able to discover options based on a budgeted learning objective. The BONN model is evaluated on different classical RL problems, demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative interesting results.",0
"In many real world decision making problems such as route planning for autonomous vehicles or portfolio optimization for financial investment, multiple objectives need to be simultaneously considered while making decisions under uncertainty. To handle these situations, Multi-Objective Decision Making (MODM) approaches have been proposed which generate a set of Pareto optimal solutions that balance competing goals. However, traditional MODM algorithms often struggle in cases where only limited budget can be allocated for gathering data, due to their inability to efficiently explore different scenarios. This study proposes an approach called options discovery with budgeted reinforcement learning to address this issue. By leveraging the concept of option discovery from temporal abstractions literature, our method constructs diverse sets of policies through efficient search space exploration. These policies are then used to guide cost effective exploration towards achieving better tradeoffs across multiple objectives. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state of the art methods on benchmark decision making problems characterized by partial observability, stochasticity and high dimensionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in a simulated driving scenario where both safety and efficiency objectives must be satisfied within a fixed total cost.",1
"Recent advances in one-shot learning have produced models that can learn from a handful of labeled examples, for passive classification and regression tasks. This paper combines reinforcement learning with one-shot learning, allowing the model to decide, during classification, which examples are worth labeling. We introduce a classification task in which a stream of images are presented and, on each time step, a decision must be made to either predict a label or pay to receive the correct label. We present a recurrent neural network based action-value function, and demonstrate its ability to learn how and when to request labels. Through the choice of reward function, the model can achieve a higher prediction accuracy than a similar model on a purely supervised task, or trade prediction accuracy for fewer label requests.",0
"In recent years, active one-shot learning has emerged as a powerful technique for solving real-world problems requiring minimal data availability. This method combines classical machine learning techniques such as supervised learning and reinforcement learning by incorporating an iterative loop of hypothesis generation, experimentation, evaluation, and refinement into a single framework. By actively selecting hypotheses based on their potential impact and evaluating them through controlled experiments, active one-shot learners can quickly identify optimal solutions without resorting to excessive training or search spaces. This makes the approach highly scalable and applicable across a wide range of domains, from image classification to natural language processing. In our study, we propose an efficient algorithmic design that improves upon existing methods by introducing better exploration strategies, tighter theoretical bounds, and enhanced generalization properties. Our extensive experimental analysis demonstrates significant advantages over state-of-the-art approaches under diverse conditions, including challenges related to data scarcity and nonlinear environments. Ultimately, our work advances the understanding of active one-shot learning mechanisms while opening new directions for further research opportunities.",1
"Besides independent learning, human learning process is highly improved by summarizing what has been learned, communicating it with peers, and subsequently fusing knowledge from different sources to assist the current learning goal. This collaborative learning procedure ensures that the knowledge is shared, continuously refined, and concluded from different perspectives to construct a more profound understanding. The idea of knowledge transfer has led to many advances in machine learning and data mining, but significant challenges remain, especially when it comes to reinforcement learning, heterogeneous model structures, and different learning tasks. Motivated by human collaborative learning, in this paper we propose a collaborative deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) framework that performs adaptive knowledge transfer among heterogeneous learning agents. Specifically, the proposed CDRL conducts a novel deep knowledge distillation method to address the heterogeneity among different learning tasks with a deep alignment network. Furthermore, we present an efficient collaborative Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (cA3C) algorithm to incorporate deep knowledge distillation into the online training of agents, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the CDRL framework using extensive empirical evaluation on OpenAI gym.",0
"In this work we study deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as well as multiagent DRL from first principles, focusing on problems which cannot be solved by single agent RL algorithms alone due to the complexity of the environment and/or amount of exploration required. We then use this understanding to develop a new algorithm that allows multiple agents to collaborate with each other to learn optimal policies more efficiently than they could have done individually. This is achieved via explicit communication amongst the agents allowing them to share experiences and plan actions jointly. Our approach makes several contributions: it provides theoretical insight into why such collaboration can lead to faster convergence; it proposes novel techniques for efficient distributed learning and experience sharing; and through extensive experiments, demonstrates the effectiveness of our method across a range of challenging multiagent domains.",1
"Bottom-Up (BU) saliency models do not perform well in complex interactive environments where humans are actively engaged in tasks (e.g., sandwich making and playing the video games). In this paper, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to highlight task-relevant locations of input frames. We propose a soft attention mechanism combined with the Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to teach an RL agent how to play a game and where to look by focusing on the most pertinent parts of its visual input. Our evaluations on several Atari 2600 games show that the soft attention based model could predict fixation locations significantly better than bottom-up models such as Itti-Kochs saliency and Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) models.",0
"This study presents a new approach for learning to predict which locations in interactive environments are most likely to result in rewarding outcomes using deep recurrent Q-learning (DRQ). DRQ combines traditional Q-learning with deep neural networks, allowing agents to learn both temporally extended behaviors and spatially distributed representations. Our method uses recurrent Q-networks (RQN) in conjunction with asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) learning to create policies that can effectively guide agent behavior towards desirable outcomes while adapting to changing environmental conditions over time. We evaluate our approach on several challenging tasks from popular deep reinforcement learning benchmark suites such as Atari games, Mountain Car, and Acrobot. Results demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches and show significant generalization across multiple domains and task variations. Overall, these findings provide evidence that DRQ is capable of producing high performance solutions even under complex interaction scenarios and variable task parameters. By enabling more effective decision making in uncertain and dynamic situations, we believe DRQ has important implications for building robust intelligent agents that operate in real-world settings.",1
"We examine the problem of joint top-down active search of multiple objects under interaction, e.g., person riding a bicycle, cups held by the table, etc.. Such objects under interaction often can provide contextual cues to each other to facilitate more efficient search. By treating each detector as an agent, we present the first collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for joint active object localization, which effectively exploits such beneficial contextual information. We learn inter-agent communication through cross connections with gates between the Q-networks, which is facilitated by a novel multi-agent deep Q-learning algorithm with joint exploitation sampling. We verify our proposed method on multiple object detection benchmarks. Not only does our model help to improve the performance of state-of-the-art active localization models, it also reveals interesting co-detection patterns that are intuitively interpretable.",0
This paper presents a collaborative deep reinforcement learning framework for joint object search. We propose that each agent learns from observing other agents’ experiences through the process of interaction and exploration on their own local environment. Our approach incorporates several innovations including policy distillation which helps learn a shared representation of experience across all agents. Through evaluation we demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon existing state-of-the art methods achieving better performance on cooperative multi-agent task completion problems with a variety of complexity levels.,1
"Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.",0

"We study reinforcement learning of chatbots with recurrent neural network architectures when the rewards are noisy and expensive to obtain. For instance, a chatbot used in automated customer service support can be scored by quality assurance agents, but this process can be expensive, time consuming and noisy. Previous reinforcement learning work for natural language processing uses on-policy updates and/or is designed for on-line learning settings. We demonstrate empirically that such strategies are not appropriate for this setting and develop an off-policy batch policy gradient method (BPG). We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via a series of synthetic experiments and an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment on a restaurant recommendations dataset.",0
"Here is the result:  In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing neural conversation models that can generate human-like responses in natural language processing tasks. One challenge faced by these models is how to effectively optimize their performance using gradient methods. Traditional policy gradient methods suffer from high variance and have difficulty scaling up to larger datasets. In this paper, we propose batch policy gradient methods as a solution to address these issues. Our approach uses mini-batch gradient descent techniques to update model parameters in small steps, allowing for more efficient optimization. We evaluate our method on several benchmark conversational datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results while requiring less computational resources compared to previous approaches. Our findings contribute to the development of more effective and efficient neural conversation models for natural language processing applications.",1
"Machine learning classifiers are known to be vulnerable to inputs maliciously constructed by adversaries to force misclassification. Such adversarial examples have been extensively studied in the context of computer vision applications. In this work, we show adversarial attacks are also effective when targeting neural network policies in reinforcement learning. Specifically, we show existing adversarial example crafting techniques can be used to significantly degrade test-time performance of trained policies. Our threat model considers adversaries capable of introducing small perturbations to the raw input of the policy. We characterize the degree of vulnerability across tasks and training algorithms, for a subclass of adversarial-example attacks in white-box and black-box settings. Regardless of the learned task or training algorithm, we observe a significant drop in performance, even with small adversarial perturbations that do not interfere with human perception. Videos are available at http://rll.berkeley.edu/adversarial.",0
"In recent years there has been an explosion in interest and research surrounding adversarial attacks against deep learning models. While most prior work focused on classification problems such as object recognition or speech synthesis, we demonstrate that neural network policies trained to make decisions in high stakes applications can potentially suffer from similar types of vulnerabilities, even leading to catastrophic failures in safety critical domains like self-driving cars or drug discovery pipelines. Our approach builds upon classical gradient based methods by developing specialized search algorithms tailored towards finding targeted mispredictions for policy networks. We evaluate our method across numerous state-of-the art reinforcement learning environments, demonstrating how well crafted perturbations can lead existing models astray. Finally, we highlight how these issues may manifest in real world decision making scenarios, providing recommendations for mitigation strategies to ensure robustness under potential threats posed by adversaries attempting to manipulate predictions in malicious ways. Our study serves as a call to action for further research into improving interpretability, understanding robustness and generalizing performance metrics beyond test set accuracy for deployment of deep learning policies into critical systems.",1
"Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy. While these attributes may be acquired naturally by human players, teaching them to a computer program is a far more challenging task. In recent years, extensive research was carried out in the field of reinforcement learning and numerous algorithms were introduced, aiming to learn how to perform human tasks such as playing video games. As a result, the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) (Bellemare et al., 2013) has become a commonly used benchmark environment allowing algorithms to train on various Atari 2600 games. In many games the state-of-the-art algorithms outperform humans. In this paper we introduce a new learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment --- RLE, that can run games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis and several other gaming consoles. The environment is expandable, allowing for more video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python and Torch. SNES games pose a significant challenge to current algorithms due to their higher level of complexity and versatility.",0
"In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in retro gaming as more and more gamers seek out classic games from previous console generations such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).

This paper explores the benefits of using a retro learning environment to play SNES games, highlighting how it can provide a nostalgic experience while also offering unique educational opportunities. Additionally, we discuss some of the challenges associated with running retro systems and outline strategies for overcoming them. Finally, we conclude by suggesting future directions for research in this area and implications for education and game design.",1
"We propose augmenting deep neural networks with an attention mechanism for the visual object detection task. As perceiving a scene, humans have the capability of multiple fixation points, each attended to scene content at different locations and scales. However, such a mechanism is missing in the current state-of-the-art visual object detection methods. Inspired by the human vision system, we propose a novel deep network architecture that imitates this attention mechanism. As detecting objects in an image, the network adaptively places a sequence of glimpses of different shapes at different locations in the image. Evidences of the presence of an object and its location are extracted from these glimpses, which are then fused for estimating the object class and bounding box coordinates. Due to lacks of ground truth annotations of the visual attention mechanism, we train our network using a reinforcement learning algorithm with policy gradients. Experiment results on standard object detection benchmarks show that the proposed network consistently outperforms the baseline networks that does not model the attention mechanism.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results on computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, these models can still suffer from several limitations, including poor interpretability and lack of attention mechanisms that allow them to focus selectively on different regions of the input data. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture called the attentional network for visual object detection. This model combines two key components: a feature extraction backbone based on a CNN, followed by an attentional mechanism that learns to selectively attend to relevant features at each layer. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets while providing improved interpretability and robustness against noise and occlusions. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards developing more advanced and versatile machine learning systems for complex computer vision problems.",1
"Reinforcement learning can enable complex, adaptive behavior to be learned automatically for autonomous robotic platforms. However, practical deployment of reinforcement learning methods must contend with the fact that the training process itself can be unsafe for the robot. In this paper, we consider the specific case of a mobile robot learning to navigate an a priori unknown environment while avoiding collisions. In order to learn collision avoidance, the robot must experience collisions at training time. However, high-speed collisions, even at training time, could damage the robot. A successful learning method must therefore proceed cautiously, experiencing only low-speed collisions until it gains confidence. To this end, we present an uncertainty-aware model-based learning algorithm that estimates the probability of collision together with a statistical estimate of uncertainty. By formulating an uncertainty-dependent cost function, we show that the algorithm naturally chooses to proceed cautiously in unfamiliar environments, and increases the velocity of the robot in settings where it has high confidence. Our predictive model is based on bootstrapped neural networks using dropout, allowing it to process raw sensory inputs from high-bandwidth sensors such as cameras. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively minimizes dangerous collisions at training time in an obstacle avoidance task for a simulated and real-world quadrotor, and a real-world RC car.

"This paper presents a novel approach to collision avoidance using uncertainty-aware reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional RL algorithms often make decisions based on complete knowledge of the environment, which may lead to suboptimal solutions in uncertain environments where accurate state estimation is challenging. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-aware model that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with the estimated states and uses this uncertainty to guide decision making. Our approach utilizes a deep neural network to learn a policy that maps high-dimensional sensor data to control actions while accounting for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. We demonstrate through simulation experiments that our proposed method outperforms standard RL methods in terms of safety and efficiency, particularly in environments with significant uncertainty. This work paves the way for more robust collision avoidance systems for autonomous vehicles operating in real-world settings.",1
"Scalable and effective exploration remains a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). While there are methods with optimality guarantees in the setting of discrete state and action spaces, these methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional deep RL scenarios. As such, most contemporary RL relies on simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy exploration or adding Gaussian noise to the controls. This paper introduces Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME), an exploration strategy based on maximization of information gain about the agent's belief of environment dynamics. We propose a practical implementation, using variational inference in Bayesian neural networks which efficiently handles continuous state and action spaces. VIME modifies the MDP reward function, and can be applied with several different underlying RL algorithms. We demonstrate that VIME achieves significantly better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety of continuous control tasks and algorithms, including tasks with very sparse rewards.",0
"Abstract: ""Exploration is crucial for reinforcement learning algorithms to efficiently discover new states, actions, rewards and state representations that improve their task performance.

Our approach explicitly models task performance improvement and incorporates both epistemic (aleatoric) and pragmatic (epistemic) forms of uncertainty as sources of curiosity into the agent’s perception of information gain and thus guides agents towards more informative experiences and improved future decision making. We evaluate our method across diverse tasks including continuous control domains, games, navigation problems, text-based environments, and deep multi-agent benchmarks such as StarCraft II micromanagement, StarCraft AlphaZeroZero, and complex Atari games, comparing against several state-of-the-art exploration methods.""",1
"Autonomous control systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft benefit from having cognitive capabilities like learning so that they can adapt to unexpected situations in-situ. Q-learning is a form of reinforcement learning and it has been efficient in solving certain class of learning problems. However, embedded systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft rarely implement learning algorithms due to the constraints faced in the field, like processing power, chip size, convergence rate and costs due to the need for radiation hardening. These challenges present a compelling need for a portable, low-power, area efficient hardware accelerator to make learning algorithms practical onboard space hardware. This paper presents a FPGA implementation of Q-learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

"The Human visual perception of the world is of a large fixed image that is highly detailed and sharp. However, receptor density in the retina is not uniform: a small central region called the fovea is very dense and exhibits high resolution, whereas a peripheral region around it has much lower spatial resolution. Thus, contrary to our perception, we are only able to observe a very small region around the line of sight with high resolution. The perception of a complete and stable view is aided by an attention mechanism that directs the eyes to the numerous points of interest within the scene. The eyes move between these targets in quick, unconscious movements, known as ""saccades"". Once a target is centered at the fovea, the eyes fixate for a fraction of a second while the visual system extracts the necessary information. An artificial visual system was built based on a fully recurrent neural network set within a reinforcement learning protocol, and learned to attend to regions of interest while solving a classification task. The model is consistent with several experimentally observed phenomena, and suggests novel predictions.",0
"An attention mechanism allows an artificial neural network to selectively focus on different parts of input data by learning which features contribute most to predictions.

Our system is able to learn robust attention models without using human engineering as opposed to some previous work utilizing human-engineered spatial transformer networks (STNs). Additionally, our method provides interpretable internal representation learning, thus allowing us to investigate how CDBNs use attention at different layers, making the learned models more explainable than those of competing methods.

By utilizing computer vision techniques to highlight important regions within each image, RVA allows learners to focus their attention more effectively than they would otherwise be able to. Additionally, it offers interactive feedback that can adapt to each individual learner’s strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to receive customized guidance throughout the process. Overall, our results indicate that RVAs hold great promise for improving the effectiveness of medical imaging education programs, which may ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.",1
"In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.",0

"The combinatorial explosion that plagues planning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be moderated using state abstraction. Prohibitively large task representations can be condensed such that essential information is preserved, and consequently, solutions are tractably computable. However, exact abstractions, which treat only fully-identical situations as equivalent, fail to present opportunities for abstraction in environments where no two situations are exactly alike. In this work, we investigate approximate state abstractions, which treat nearly-identical situations as equivalent. We present theoretical guarantees of the quality of behaviors derived from four types of approximate abstractions. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that approximate abstractions lead to reduction in task complexity and bounded loss of optimality of behavior in a variety of environments.",0

We show how our approach improves upon existing methods that use exact state representations and offer theoretical guarantees of suboptimality. The results are demonstrated through simulation experiments involving a realistic autonomous driving scenario, achieving significantly better performance than alternative approaches.

"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can effectively interact with humans in complex tasks. These human-in-the-loop systems require agents that can learn from user feedback and adapt their behavior accordingly. However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific models or assume access to full state observations, which may limit their applicability in real-world settings where these assumptions cannot always be met.  In this work, we propose a novel agent-agnostic approach to human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that addresses these limitations. Our method leverages natural language instruction as a means for users to provide guidance to the agent, allowing them to specify objectives and constraints in a flexible manner. This enables our algorithm to generalize across different domains and tasks without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying environment dynamics.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments conducted on several benchmark environments, including both simulated robotics domains and real-world systems such as grid worlds and game environments. Results show that our agent significantly outperforms previous methods while requiring less interaction with the user. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of our system by investigating how it handles incomplete or incorrect instructions, showing that it can still achieve reasonable performance even under these conditions.

This includes issues such as computational cost, memory constraints, sensitivity to initial conditions, and difficulty incorporating prior knowledge into the model. These challenges have motivated recent advances in large-scale machine learning techniques aimed at addressing these shortcomings. We introduce a novel method for efficiently training Gaussian mixture models on large datasets by combining stochastic gradient ascent with automatic relevance determination. Our approach builds upon previous work in variational Bayesian inference and approximates high-dimensional integrals using randomization methods derived from Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, including improvements in accuracy and scalability. Additionally, we provide insights into the properties of the algorithm through empirical studies focused on convergence rates, sample efficiency, and robustness to hyperparameter choices. By extending these results to larger problems, we envision significant gains in performance throughout science, engineering, and other areas where complex data analysis requires advanced modelling tools.",1

"Title: ""Threshold-Based Learning for Neural Networks""  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used successfully in many domains due to their ability to learn complex tasks without explicit rewards. However, existing RL methods often suffer from slow convergence rates, high sensitivity to hyperparameter settings, and poor scalability. This work proposes a new threshold-based scheme that addresses these limitations by introducing a novel methodology for designing reward functions and optimizing neural network architectures. Our approach employs a simple yet effective mechanism inspired by human behavior, where the agent learns from experience and makes decisions based on a set of predefined thresholds. By adjusting these thresholds over time, our algorithm can effectively capture both short-term and long-term dependencies while adapting to changes in the environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in multiple benchmark problems, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across various metrics such as convergence rate, accuracy, and robustness to hyperparameters. Overall, we believe that this research opens up exciting opportunities for improving current reinforcement learning algorithms and enabling more advanced applications in artificial intelligence.",1
"The majority of online display ads are served through real-time bidding (RTB) --- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally, it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition, we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation using neural networks.",0
"In this research we propose real time bidding (RTB) using reinforcement learning algorithms that aim at maximizing return on investment (ROI). This approach enables display advertisers to automate their campaigns and use large amounts of data such as user browsing history to better target ad impressions, hence improving performance metrics like click through rate (CTR), conversion rates and ROI. We present preliminary results from tests run on public datasets showing improvements compared to benchmark approaches. Our work contributes to making RTB more accessible and efficient for advertisers and publishers while providing relevant content to users. ----This abstract describes a research project focused on developing a method for real-time bidding in display advertising using reinforcement learning algorithms. The objective of this approach is to increase return on investment (ROI) by automatically optimizing ad placements based on factors such as user browsing history. Preliminary testing has shown promising improvements over traditional methods, resulting in higher click-through rates, conversion rates, and ROIs. By making RTB more effective and efficient, this work seeks to benefit both advertisers and publishers while enhancing the overall experience for internet users.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting \textit{Deep Recurrent Q-Network} (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can solve problems in partially observable environments. These types of environments pose significant challenges to traditional methods due to their inherent uncertainty and partial observability. As such, researchers have proposed several approaches to address these issues, including deep recurrent Q-learning (DRQ). DRQ uses deep neural networks to represent the state value function and the action-value function, which allows it to learn both short-term and long-term dependencies and make accurate predictions in complex environments. Furthermore, the model utilizes experience replay and target network updates to reduce instability and improve sample efficiency. This work evaluates the effectiveness of DRQ on a range of benchmark tasks, comparing its performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Results indicate that DRQ outperforms all other models across multiple domains, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for solving real-world problems in partially observable settings. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of DRQ and paves the way for future advances in the field.",1
"Many machine learning tasks, such as learning with invariance and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, can be characterized as problems of learning from conditional distributions. In such problems, each sample $x$ itself is associated with a conditional distribution $p(z|x)$ represented by samples $\{z_i\}_{i=1}^M$, and the goal is to learn a function $f$ that links these conditional distributions to target values $y$. These learning problems become very challenging when we only have limited samples or in the extreme case only one sample from each conditional distribution. Commonly used approaches either assume that $z$ is independent of $x$, or require an overwhelmingly large samples from each conditional distribution.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach which employs a new min-max reformulation of the learning from conditional distribution problem. With such new reformulation, we only need to deal with the joint distribution $p(z,x)$. We also design an efficient learning algorithm, Embedding-SGD, and establish theoretical sample complexity for such problems. Finally, our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed approach can significantly improve over the existing algorithms.",0
"In this paper we study learning from conditional distributions by means of dual embeddings. Our model operates on two embedded spaces: one capturing data statistics and another estimating pairwise similarity based on a predefined kernel function. We show that under certain conditions our approach can recover the underlying true distribution. This is achieved through a nonparametric estimation procedure relying solely on observed samples without any assumptions imposed on their shape. An important aspect of our methodology lies in constructing confidence regions for both the distribution itself as well as the learned embedding coordinates, yielding rigorous statistical guarantees. A thorough experimental evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets validates both the accuracy of our algorithm and the benefits it confers over conventional machine learning techniques. Altogether our results contribute towards making dual embeddings a promising direction for tackling complex inference tasks beyond simple classification problems.",1
"Temporal Difference learning or TD($\lambda$) is a fundamental algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning. However, setting TD's $\lambda$ parameter, which controls the timescale of TD updates, is generally left up to the practitioner. We formalize the $\lambda$ selection problem as a bias-variance trade-off where the solution is the value of $\lambda$ that leads to the smallest Mean Squared Value Error (MSVE). To solve this trade-off we suggest applying Leave-One-Trajectory-Out Cross-Validation (LOTO-CV) to search the space of $\lambda$ values. Unfortunately, this approach is too computationally expensive for most practical applications. For Least Squares TD (LSTD) we show that LOTO-CV can be implemented efficiently to automatically tune $\lambda$ and apply function optimization methods to efficiently search the space of $\lambda$ values. The resulting algorithm, ALLSTD, is parameter free and our experiments demonstrate that ALLSTD is significantly computationally faster than the na\""{i}ve LOTO-CV implementation while achieving similar performance.",0
"One approach to temporal difference learning is based on a family of algorithms called LAMBDA, which we previously introduced as part of a tutorial. The lambda architecture allows us to learn in two different ways: by maintaining running averages of estimates (on line 4) and making updates proportional to the current estimate (on line 7). This flexibility has several advantages over more traditional methods like TD(λ), such as improved speed and numerical stability. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased parameter sensitivity, where even small changes to hyperparameters can have significant impacts on performance. To address this issue, we introduce ADAPTIVE LAMBDAs, which adjust parameters dynamically during training based on observed error. By doing so, they provide automatic tuning capabilities that improve upon previous work in this area while retaining the original algorithm’s strengths. Our results show that adaptivity leads to better generalization across diverse domains and makes it possible to leverage larger networks without sacrificing accuracy or robustness. These findings support our belief that leveraging adaptive models in conjunction with online learning provides both scalability and interpretability benefits compared to offline alternatives. While there remains room for further experimentation, we believe that our contributions represent an important step towards building more capable artificial intelligence systems and hope that others build upon them to achieve even greater successes in the future.",1
"Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning from their mistakes, but it has not yet been successfully used for automotive applications. There has recently been a revival of interest in the topic, however, driven by the ability of deep learning algorithms to learn good representations of the environment. Motivated by Google DeepMind's successful demonstrations of learning for games from Breakout to Go, we will propose different methods for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular interest as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem as it has a strong interaction with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As this is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we will formulate two main categories of algorithms: 1) Discrete actions category, and 2) Continuous actions category. For the discrete actions category, we will deal with Deep Q-Network Algorithm (DQN) while for the continuous actions category, we will deal with Deep Deterministic Actor Critic Algorithm (DDAC). In addition to that, We will also discover the performance of these two categories on an open source car simulator for Racing called (TORCS) which stands for The Open Racing car Simulator. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction with other vehicles. Finally, we explain the effect of some restricted conditions, put on the car during the learning phase, on the convergence time for finishing its learning phase.",0
"Title: ""Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assistance""  Lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems play a crucial role in automating driving tasks, making transportation safer and more efficient. While traditional approaches rely on rule-based models that assume fixed lanes and simple traffic scenarios, these limitations restrict their reliability in real-world situations. To overcome such shortcomings, we propose an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework to learn effective LKA policies directly from raw sensor data. By leveraging convolutional neural networks and actor-critic algorithms, our system can adaptively adjust to changing road conditions while ensuring safe trajectories. We evaluate our method against several state-of-the-art approaches under diverse driving conditions, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics. Our results pave the way for next-generation autonomous vehicles capable of handling complex lane changes and obstacle avoidance, opening new horizons for intelligent transportation solutions.",1
"In machine learning, error back-propagation in multi-layer neural networks (deep learning) has been impressively successful in supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. As a model for learning in the brain, however, deep learning has long been regarded as implausible, since it relies in its basic form on a non-local plasticity rule. To overcome this problem, energy-based models with local contrastive Hebbian learning were proposed and tested on a classification task with networks of rate neurons. We extended this work by implementing and testing such a model with networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Preliminary results indicate that it is possible to learn a non-linear regression task with hidden layers, spiking neurons and a local synaptic plasticity rule.",0
"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been proposed as an alternative paradigm to traditional artificial neural networks due to their biological plausibility and potential benefits in terms of computational efficiency and robustness. However, training SNNs remains challenging due to the discontinuous nature of spike trains, which makes backpropagation through time difficult to implement. To address these issues, we propose using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the synaptic conductance update rule derived from contrastive Hebbian learning. Our approach enables us to learn deep SNN architectures directly from raw pixel inputs without requiring preprocessing steps such as feature extraction. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including handwritten digits and CIFAR-10, demonstrating that our model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters required. Furthermore, we show that the learned representations encode meaningful features, suggesting that our model can capture relevant structure within the data. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards enabling deep learning with spiking neurons.",1
"We develop a general problem setting for training and testing the ability of agents to gather information efficiently.

We empirically demonstrate that these agents learn to search actively and intelligently for new information to reduce their uncertainty, and to exploit information they have already acquired.",0
"Abstract: This article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) systems can assist users in finding information effectively by incorporating human-like behaviors such as decision making and interaction. Drawing from theories on communication and cognitive science, we propose that successful human-AI interaction requires three key elements: understanding user needs, identifying relevant sources of information, and presenting findings in a clear and concise manner. We then apply these principles to develop a framework for designing AI agents capable of seeking out reliable information efficiently. Our research contributes to existing work on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, demonstrating how AI systems can be developed into effective tools for everyday use. Finally, we explore potential applications of our approach and suggest directions for future research.",1
"We study the online estimation of the optimal policy of a Markov decision process (MDP). We propose a class of Stochastic Primal-Dual (SPD) methods which exploit the inherent minimax duality of Bellman equations. The SPD methods update a few coordinates of the value and policy estimates as a new state transition is observed. These methods use small storage and has low computational complexity per iteration. The SPD methods find an absolute-$\epsilon$-optimal policy, with high probability, using $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{|\mathcal{S}|^4 |\mathcal{A}|^2\sigma^2 }{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2} \right)$ iterations/samples for the infinite-horizon discounted-reward MDP and $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{|\mathcal{S}|^4 |\mathcal{A}|^2H^6\sigma^2 }{\epsilon^2} \right)$ for the finite-horizon MDP.",0
"This paper presents stochastic primal-dual methods and their application in reinforcement learning (RL). We consider problems where both the reward function and constraints are unknown and can only be estimated using samples. Our approach builds on recent advances in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic dual ascent (SDA), but overcomes their limitations by providing algorithms that achieve improved sample complexity guarantees while preserving low computational costs.  We develop two new methods: the first is based on SDA and admits a regret bound proportional to T^(2/3); the second is based on a novel variant of the proximal policy optimization algorithm and attains regrets proportional to T^(1/4). For comparison, we revisit the method from Chen et al.'s work; although this method achieves superior theoretical bounds, our simulations demonstrate substantially worse performance in practice. Finally, our experiments on continuous control tasks illustrate how the choice of RL algorithm impacts policy quality and may have significant consequences for real-world applications. \newpage Introduction:In this research paper, we study the problem of solving sequential decision making under uncertainty using the framework of reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we focus on settings where both the reward functions and constraint sets are unknown and must be learned via sampling. Motivated by recent progress in stochastic approximation and online learning, we present two new stochastic primal-dual methods tailored specifically for this setting. Our methods significantly improve upon previous approaches in terms of sample complexity while still maintaining tractability in computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these new techniques through extensive numerical studies. Furthermore, by comparing against existing state-of-the-art results from Chen et al., we highlight the advantage of our proposed algorithms on several continuous control tasks commonly used in robotics and automation. Lastly, we discuss potential extensions and future directions for further improving the applicability o",1
"Superoptimization requires the estimation of the best program for a given computational task. In order to deal with large programs, superoptimization techniques perform a stochastic search. This involves proposing a modification of the current program, which is accepted or rejected based on the improvement achieved. The state of the art method uses uniform proposal distributions, which fails to exploit the problem structure to the fullest. To alleviate this deficiency, we learn a proposal distribution over possible modifications using Reinforcement Learning. We provide convincing results on the superoptimization of ""Hacker's Delight"" programs.",0
"Improving program performance through manual optimization can be time consuming and error prone. In recent years, machine learning has been applied as a solution to automatically optimize software, achieving state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks. However, due to limited availability and high demand, access to large scale automatic differentiation frameworks required for training these models remains out of reach for most researchers. This work presents an alternative approach: rather than teaching machines how to write code, we train humans in techniques used by experts that can achieve professional level optimizations without automation. We demonstrate our methodology through a case study where participants were able to manually optimize a neural network architecture to within 97% of the state of art, surpassing prior expectations set by domain professionals and machine learned models alike.",1
"Exploration has been a crucial part of reinforcement learning, yet several important questions concerning exploration efficiency are still not answered satisfactorily by existing analytical frameworks. These questions include exploration parameter setting, situation analysis, and hardness of MDPs, all of which are unavoidable for practitioners. To bridge the gap between the theory and practice, we propose a new analytical framework called the success probability of exploration. We show that those important questions of exploration above can all be answered under our framework, and the answers provided by our framework meet the needs of practitioners better than the existing ones. More importantly, we introduce a concrete and practical approach to evaluating the success probabilities in certain MDPs without the need of actually running the learning algorithm. We then provide empirical results to verify our approach, and demonstrate how the success probability of exploration can be used to analyse and predict the behaviours and possible outcomes of exploration, which are the keys to the answer of the important questions of exploration.",0

By examining real-world examples and case studies, we provide insights into how exploration can impact learning outcomes and identify key factors that influence the likelihood of success. Our findings suggest that while exploration can offer opportunities for growth and development, it may not always lead to optimal results. We propose recommendations for learners and educators on how to maximize their chances of success through strategic use of exploration techniques. Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of learning efficiency and provides valuable guidance for those seeking to improve their performance.",1
"This paper studies systematic exploration for reinforcement learning with rich observations and function approximation. We introduce a new model called contextual decision processes, that unifies and generalizes most prior settings. Our first contribution is a complexity measure, the Bellman rank, that we show enables tractable learning of near-optimal behavior in these processes and is naturally small for many well-studied reinforcement learning settings. Our second contribution is a new reinforcement learning algorithm that engages in systematic exploration to learn contextual decision processes with low Bellman rank. Our algorithm provably learns near-optimal behavior with a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent of the number of unique observations. The approach uses Bellman error minimization with optimistic exploration and provides new insights into efficient exploration for reinforcement learning with function approximation.",0
"Abstract: In this paper we study decision processes that have low Bellman rank, meaning that the outcome of each action only depends on a small number of variables in the problem domain. We show that under certain conditions these decision processes can be learned efficiently using the concept of pseudo-polytime algorithms (PAC learning). Our results provide insight into which types of problems are learnable by providing simple conditions under which they can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, our work contributes to the understanding of how decisions made within specific contexts can affect overall performance, highlighting the importance of considering both individual actions and their dependencies within the larger system.",1
"Handwriting is a skill learned by humans from a very early age. The ability to develop one's own unique handwriting as well as mimic another person's handwriting is a task learned by the brain with practice. This paper deals with this very problem where an intelligent system tries to learn the handwriting of an entity using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We propose a modified architecture of DCGAN (Radford, Metz, and Chintala 2015) to achieve this. We also discuss about applying reinforcement learning techniques to achieve faster learning. Our algorithm hopes to give new insights in this area and its uses include identification of forged documents, signature verification, computer generated art, digitization of documents among others. Our early implementation of the algorithm illustrates a good performance with MNIST datasets.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing techniques that can automatically analyze handwriting samples and provide insights into various aspects such as personality traits, cognitive abilities, age group, gender, education level, etc. One promising approach towards achieving these objectives involves training generative adversarial networks (GANs) on large datasets of handwritten text. GANs consist of two components: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator attempts to generate realistic synthetic data while the discriminator tries to distinguish real from generated data. By optimizing both components simultaneously through a competitive process, high quality synthetic images similar to the real ones can be produced by the generator. These generated images can then be used for profiling purposes under privacy preserving settings where direct access to personal data may not be possible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology on several benchmark datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, we believe that our work significantly advances research in the field of handwriting analysis and provides a framework for exploring novel applications in related domains.",1
"Training robots to perceive, act and communicate using multiple modalities still represents a challenging problem, particularly if robots are expected to learn efficiently from small sets of example interactions. We describe a learning approach as a step in this direction, where we teach a humanoid robot how to play the game of noughts and crosses. Given that multiple multimodal skills can be trained to play this game, we focus our attention to training the robot to perceive the game, and to interact in this game. Our multimodal deep reinforcement learning agent perceives multimodal features and exhibits verbal and non-verbal actions while playing. Experimental results using simulations show that the robot can learn to win or draw up to 98% of the games. A pilot test of the proposed multimodal system for the targeted game---integrating speech, vision and gestures---reports that reasonable and fluent interactions can be achieved using the proposed approach.",0
"This research paper presents a novel approach to training interactive humanoid robots using multimodal deep reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional robotic training methods rely heavily on predefined rules and scripts, which can result in rigid and inflexible behaviors that fail to account for real-world variations. In contrast, our method leverages RL techniques that allow the robot to learn from trial-and-error interactions with its environment and users.  The proposed approach involves multiple sensory modalities, such as vision, audition, touch, and language processing, which enables the robot to gather richer information about its surroundings and make more informed decisions. We developed a hierarchical framework consisting of several subtasks that work together seamlessly to achieve high-level goals specified by humans. Our algorithm incorporates temporal abstraction mechanisms to model longer-term consequences of actions taken during interaction, further improving the performance of the robot.  We evaluated our system through extensive experiments involving both simulated environments and physical robots interacting with human subjects in controlled settings. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of efficiency, adaptability, and overall user satisfaction.

"Quantum control is valuable for various quantum technologies such as high-fidelity gates for universal quantum computing, adaptive quantum-enhanced metrology, and ultra-cold atom manipulation. Although supervised machine learning and reinforcement learning are widely used for optimizing control parameters in classical systems, quantum control for parameter optimization is mainly pursued via gradient-based greedy algorithms. Although the quantum fitness landscape is often compatible with greedy algorithms, sometimes greedy algorithms yield poor results, especially for large-dimensional quantum systems. We employ differential evolution algorithms to circumvent the stagnation problem of non-convex optimization. We improve quantum control fidelity for noisy system by averaging over the objective function. To reduce computational cost, we introduce heuristics for early termination of runs and for adaptive selection of search subspaces. Our implementation is massively parallel and vectorized to reduce run time even further. We demonstrate our methods with two examples, namely quantum phase estimation and quantum gate design, for which we achieve superior fidelity and scalability than obtained using greedy algorithms.",0

"We present a method for performing hierarchical object detection in images guided by a deep reinforcement learning agent. The key idea is to focus on those parts of the image that contain richer information and zoom on them. We train an intelligent agent that, given an image window, is capable of deciding where to focus the attention among five different predefined region candidates (smaller windows). This procedure is iterated providing a hierarchical image analysis.We compare two different candidate proposal strategies to guide the object search: with and without overlap. Moreover, our work compares two different strategies to extract features from a convolutional neural network for each region proposal: a first one that computes new feature maps for each region proposal, and a second one that computes the feature maps for the whole image to later generate crops for each region proposal. Experiments indicate better results for the overlapping candidate proposal strategy and a loss of performance for the cropped image features due to the loss of spatial resolution. We argue that, while this loss seems unavoidable when working with large amounts of object candidates, the much more reduced amount of region proposals generated by our reinforcement learning agent allows considering to extract features for each location without sharing convolutional computation among regions.",0
"Title: ""Hierarchical Object Detection using Deep Reinforcement Learning""  Object detection has been one of the most active research areas in computer vision over the past decade due to its wide range of applications such as robotics, surveillance, autonomous vehicles and image retrieval systems. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown remarkable performance on object detection tasks. However, these approaches suffer from high computational costs and often rely on large amounts of labeled data which may not always be available. Furthermore, they often struggle to address the problems related to localization and scale variations that arise in real-world scenarios.  In this work, we propose a novel approach based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning for accurate and efficient object detection. Our approach learns both object location and feature representation jointly through multiple levels of hierarchy by exploiting feedback from intermediate rewards. This enables our model to capture global contextual information along with fine-grained details. We achieve state-of-the-art results across various benchmark datasets while significantly reducing computational overhead. Additionally, our algorithm can adapt to varying scales and orientations without any explicit resizing operations thus making it more robust to changes in the environment.  The significance of our method lies in its ability to perform effective object detection under challenging conditions such as low quality images, occlusions, cluttered backgrounds, etc., thereby providing greater flexibility and reliability compared to traditional CNN-based methods. Our findings provide new insights into how hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms could potentially enhance many other perception tasks involving complex decision making processes.

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a recently proposed class of generative models in which a generator is trained to optimize a cost function that is being simultaneously learned by a discriminator. While the idea of learning cost functions is relatively new to the field of generative modeling, learning costs has long been studied in control and reinforcement learning (RL) domains, typically for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields, learning cost function underlying observed behavior is known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control. While at first the connection between cost learning in RL and cost learning in generative modeling may appear to be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL methods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In particular, we demonstrate an equivalence between a sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy IRL and a GAN in which the generator's density can be evaluated and is provided as an additional input to the discriminator. Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL is a special case of an energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of GANs as an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate this interpretation to other recent work that seeks to connect GANs and EBMs. By formally highlighting the connection between GANs, IRL, and EBMs, we hope that researchers in all three communities can better identify and apply transferable ideas from one domain to another, particularly for developing more stable and scalable algorithms: a major challenge in all three domains.",0
"A new approach has been developed that bridges generative adversarial networks (GANs), inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), and energy-based models (EBMs) by using GANs as a policy optimization tool in IRL, where the goal is to learn a reward function from expert demonstrations or human feedback. This connection enables training policies directly on high-dimensional sensory inputs without requiring intermediate motor actions, resulting in improved sample efficiency and interpretability compared to previous methods. Additionally, we show how EBMs can be used to regularize the agent's behavior by encouraging exploration towards low energy states, which leads to better generalization across tasks and domains. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in several benchmark environments and produces more interpretable results due to its inherent ability to map learned rewards back into image space. These contributions open up exciting opportunities for applying deep RL techniques to real-world robotic control problems, where high-quality visual feedback is readily available.",1
"This work presents a multiscale framework to solve an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem for continuous-time/state stochastic systems. We take advantage of a diffusion wavelet representation of the associated Markov chain to abstract the state space. This not only allows for effectively handling the large (and geometrically complex) decision space but also provides more interpretable representations of the demonstrated state trajectories and also of the resulting policy of IRL. In the proposed framework, the problem is divided into the global and local IRL, where the global approximation of the optimal value functions are obtained using coarse features and the local details are quantified using fine local features. An illustrative numerical example on robot path control in a complex environment is presented to verify the proposed method.",0

By modeling state values directly instead of attempting to learn models, MILD achieves more accurate policy estimation than existing methods while providing theoretical guarantees on convergence rates. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms previous methods across several domains including continuous control tasks both in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency.

"In this paper we introduce a new unsupervised reinforcement learning method for discovering the set of intrinsic options available to an agent. This set is learned by maximizing the number of different states an agent can reliably reach, as measured by the mutual information between the set of options and option termination states. To this end, we instantiate two policy gradient based algorithms, one that creates an explicit embedding space of options and one that represents options implicitly. The algorithms also provide an explicit measure of empowerment in a given state that can be used by an empowerment maximizing agent. The algorithm scales well with function approximation and we demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on a range of tasks.",0

"We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) solution to the view planning problem (VPP), which generates a sequence of view points that are capable of sensing all accessible area of a given object represented as a 3D model. In doing so, the goal is to minimize the number of view points, making the VPP a class of set covering optimization problem (SCOP). The SCOP is NP-hard, and the inapproximability results tell us that the greedy algorithm provides the best approximation that runs in polynomial time. In order to find a solution that is better than the greedy algorithm, (i) we introduce a novel score function by exploiting the geometry of the 3D model, (ii) we model an intuitive human approach to VPP using this score function, and (iii) we cast VPP as a Markovian Decision Process (MDP), and solve the MDP in RL framework using well-known RL algorithms. In particular, we use SARSA, Watkins-Q and TD with function approximation to solve the MDP. We compare the results of our method with the baseline greedy algorithm in an extensive set of test objects, and show that we can out-perform the baseline in almost all cases.",0

By formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), we can use algorithms from the field of reinforcement learning to learn policies that maximize task performance while minimizing risk and computational cost. We evaluate our approach on a set of challenging test cases and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating near-optimal solutions while offering greater control over system resources compared to traditional approaches. Our results have significant implications for applications in fields such as robotics, computer graphics, and autonomous systems where efficient view planning plays a crucial role.",1
"We introduce exploration potential, a quantity that measures how much a reinforcement learning agent has explored its environment class. In contrast to information gain, exploration potential takes the problem's reward structure into account. This leads to an exploration criterion that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic optimality (learning to act optimally across the entire environment class). Our experiments in multi-armed bandits use exploration potential to illustrate how different algorithms make the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.",0

"Balancing between computational efficiency and sample efficiency is an important goal in reinforcement learning. Temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms stochastically update the value function, with a linear time complexity in the number of features, whereas least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) algorithms are sample efficient but can be quadratic in the number of features. In this work, we develop an efficient incremental low-rank LSTD({\lambda}) algorithm that progresses towards the goal of better balancing computation and sample efficiency. The algorithm reduces the computation and storage complexity to the number of features times the chosen rank parameter while summarizing past samples efficiently to nearly obtain the sample complexity of LSTD. We derive a simulation bound on the solution given by truncated low-rank approximation, illustrating a bias- variance trade-off dependent on the choice of rank. We demonstrate that the algorithm effectively balances computational complexity and sample efficiency for policy evaluation in a benchmark task and a high-dimensional energy allocation domain.",0
"Incremental Truncated Least-Squares Temporal Differencing (IncTrunLSTD) combines incremental learning and truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT), which allows agents to learn new tasks on top of previously learned ones using less data and computational resources than traditional methods. This method makes use of a weighted combination of past experiences and new experiences during BPTT, allowing the agent to focus more heavily on recent experiences while still making use of older ones. Additionally, IncTrunLSTD utilizes early stopping to prevent overfitting and achieve faster convergence speeds compared to previous methods. Simulation results show that our proposed model achieves significantly better performance across multiple domains and outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Overall, IncTrunLSTD provides a promising solution for efficient and effective online learning in reinforcement learning settings.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward. However, environments contain a much wider variety of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on Atari, averaging 880\% expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional \emph{Labyrinth} tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10$\times$ and averaging 87\% expert human performance on Labyrinth.",0

By combining insights from both machine learning and control theory, our framework offers promise as a powerful tool for solving real world challenges involving complex interactions between agents and environments. Throughout the paper we emphasize intuitive explanations over technical details, and hope that readers will come away with a clearer understanding of why and how these techniques could prove effective.",1
"In classical reinforcement learning, when exploring an environment, agents accept arbitrary short term loss for long term gain. This is infeasible for safety critical applications, such as robotics, where even a single unsafe action may cause system failure. In this paper, we address the problem of safely exploring finite Markov decision processes (MDP). We define safety in terms of an, a priori unknown, safety constraint that depends on states and actions. We aim to explore the MDP under this constraint, assuming that the unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop a novel algorithm for this task and prove that it is able to completely explore the safely reachable part of the MDP without violating the safety constraint. To achieve this, it cautiously explores safe states and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of unvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating the environment. Moreover, the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when exploring the MDP, ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no safe way out. We demonstrate our method on digital terrain models for the task of exploring an unknown map with a rover.",0
"This paper investigates how to safely explore finite Markov decision processes (FMDPs) using Gaussian processes. We present two methods that build on previous work by combining model learning and planning under uncertainty: i) policy improvement with probabilistically valid bounds based on upper confidence intervals from GP regression; ii) Bayesian optimization of the expected cumulative reward in terms of hyperparameters of a learned FMDP model and corresponding control actions. Numerical results demonstrate that both approaches can find policies with improved safety compared to prior methods and outperform random exploration baselines significantly. While our first approach requires more function evaluations but less hyperparameter tuning than the second one, both methods achieve comparable performance overall. Our study highlights that safe exploration in FMDPs can benefit significantly from leveraging models built with state-of-the-art machine learning tools such as Gaussian process regression. Future research should investigate whether these improvements transfer to larger domains or learning from fewer data points. As a proof of concept, we provide open source code for all experiments to facilitate further analysis and extension to other MDP problem classes.",1
"We consider Bayesian optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box objective function, where we also have access to cheaper approximations of the objective. In general, such approximations arise in applications such as reinforcement learning, engineering, and the natural sciences, and are subject to an inherent, unknown bias. This model discrepancy is caused by an inadequate internal model that deviates from reality and can vary over the domain, making the utilization of these approximations a non-trivial task.   We present a novel algorithm that provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of the uncertainties arising from model discrepancies and noisy observations. Its optimization decisions rely on a value of information analysis that extends the Knowledge Gradient factor to the setting of multiple information sources that vary in cost: each sampling decision maximizes the predicted benefit per unit cost.   We conduct an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that the method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques: it finds designs of considerably higher objective value and additionally inflicts less cost in the exploration process.",0
"Title: Multi-Source Data Fusion and Decision Making for Autonomous Systems Abstract: In many real-world applications, multiple data sources can provide complementary information that could improve decision making accuracy. However, fusing these diverse data streams into a coherent representation is challenging due to differences in their characteristics such as sampling rate, resolution, noise level, and relevance. This paper proposes an efficient approach to multi-source data fusion based on the concept of active perception. By selectively gathering additional measurements from informative regions of interest (ROIs), we aim to reduce uncertainty while minimizing the number of sensory queries. Our method adopts a Bayesian framework where ROIs are identified via variational inference, and the measurement model considers sensor uncertainties and potential occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to passive strategies and other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real datasets. Moreover, we showcase the generality of our framework by applying it to different autonomy tasks, including robot localization, object detection, and map reconstruction. Overall, this work extends current knowledge of multi-information source optimization toward optimal path planning and decision making under uncertainty.",1
"In this work, we take a fresh look at some old and new algorithms for off-policy, return-based reinforcement learning. Expressing these in a common form, we derive a novel algorithm, Retrace($\lambda$), with three desired properties: (1) it has low variance; (2) it safely uses samples collected from any behaviour policy, whatever its degree of ""off-policyness""; and (3) it is efficient as it makes the best use of samples collected from near on-policy behaviour policies. We analyze the contractive nature of the related operator under both off-policy policy evaluation and control settings and derive online sample-based algorithms. We believe this is the first return-based off-policy control algorithm converging a.s. to $Q^*$ without the GLIE assumption (Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration). As a corollary, we prove the convergence of Watkins' Q($\lambda$), which was an open problem since 1989. We illustrate the benefits of Retrace($\lambda$) on a standard suite of Atari 2600 games.",0

Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis highlighting the advantage of using importance sampling as a penalty term compared to alternative approaches. Overall, our work significantly advances the field of RL by providing a practically applicable solution to safely balance exploration and exploitation in off-policy settings.",1

We discuss our approach’s efficacy through experiments on openly available datasets from both single and multiple intersections under varying circumstances, including different peak hours and traffic intensities. Our findings show that by leveraging RL techniques tailored for continuous action spaces, we can achieve improved intersection control operations relative to traditional rule-based schemes, resulting in shorter waiting times, enhanced traffic flow smoothness, and reduced delays while ensuring safety at crossroads. These benefits make our methodology ideal for eventual integration into operational traffic management platforms. Finally, our study establishes RL-driven adaptive traffic signal timing policies as a potential paradigm shift toward optimized urban transportation networks, promoting smart city development worldwide.",1
"The use of deep reinforcement learning allows for high-dimensional state descriptors, but little is known about how the choice of action representation impacts the learning difficulty and the resulting performance. We compare the impact of four different action parameterizations (torques, muscle-activations, target joint angles, and target joint-angle velocities) in terms of learning time, policy robustness, motion quality, and policy query rates. Our results are evaluated on a gait-cycle imitation task for multiple planar articulated figures and multiple gaits. We demonstrate that the local feedback provided by higher-level action parameterizations can significantly impact the learning, robustness, and quality of the resulting policies.",0
"In this paper we explore whether or not the choice of action space matters when learning locomotion skills using deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL). We find that while several types of actions spaces can lead to effective learning in simple tasks, when considering more complex environments, such as ones involving contact dynamics, having access to a high dimensional action space is crucial for achieving optimal results. Additionally, we show evidence that suggests certain classes of actions, such as those which allow for fine control over joint trajectories, may provide benefits over others in terms of both sample efficiency and final performance. Lastly, through analysis of the learned policies, we identify key characteristics associated with successful representations across different action spaces. This work contributes to our understanding of how action spaces impact the ability to learn complex movement patterns in DeepRL. Abstract: How the Size of Your Network Matters for Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have emerged as powerful methods for training agents to perform complex behaviors in dynamic environments. However, choosing an appropriate network architecture remains a challenge in RL research. Existing works often focus on selecting layers, activations, or hyperparameters based on heuristics or experimental results; but little attention has been paid to the size of neural networks themselves. In this study, we analyze the relationship between the size of a neural network used in RL and its resulting behavior in discrete control tasks. Our results suggest that larger networks tend to achieve better performances due to their increased capacity for expressive power, allowing them to capture richer features from input states and execute more precise outputs. Furthermore, we observe diminishing returns in expressive capacity with respect to computational cost by increasing the number of parameters beyond a point. This finding sheds light on a promising direction of model selection for RL. By identifying efficient models that strike a balance between expressivity and cost, practitioners could benefit from reduced complexity without sacrificing task performance. Ultimately, this work highlights the importance of evaluating and optimizing network sizes in developing robust RL systems.",1
"In reinforcement learning, the standard criterion to evaluate policies in a state is the expectation of (discounted) sum of rewards.

We evaluate our proposition on a simple model of the TV show, Who wants to be a millionaire.",0
"Title: ""Quantile Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training agents to perform complex tasks. However, current methods often struggle with high variance, instability, and difficulty in handling sparse rewards. In this work, we propose a new approach called quantile reinforcement learning that addresses these issues by leveraging quantiles to better handle both dense and sparse reward distributions. Our method uses quantiles to adaptively set different exploration rates for different states, enabling more efficient discovery of optimal policies for sparse environments. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark problems, including gridworlds, continuous control, and video games, we demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of efficiency, stability, and performance. Our findings suggest that using quantiles can provide robustness and scalability advantages for a wide range of applications in RL.",1

"We propose and study a new model for reinforcement learning with rich observations, generalizing contextual bandits to sequential decision making. These models require an agent to take actions based on observations (features) with the goal of achieving long-term performance competitive with a large set of policies. To avoid barriers to sample-efficient learning associated with large observation spaces and general POMDPs, we focus on problems that can be summarized by a small number of hidden states and have long-term rewards that are predictable by a reactive function class. In this setting, we design and analyze a new reinforcement learning algorithm, Least Squares Value Elimination by Exploration. We prove that the algorithm learns near optimal behavior after a number of episodes that is polynomial in all relevant parameters, logarithmic in the number of policies, and independent of the size of the observation space. Our result provides theoretical justification for reinforcement learning with function approximation.",0
"Advantages of using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) over traditional supervised learning methods have been well demonstrated due to DRL’s ability to learn from raw input data without explicit human engineering of features.

"Conceived in the early 1990s, Experience Replay (ER) has been shown to be a successful mechanism to allow online learning algorithms to reuse past experiences. Traditionally, ER can be applied to all machine learning paradigms (i.e., unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning). Recently, ER has contributed to improving the performance of deep reinforcement learning. Yet, its application to many practical settings is still limited by the memory requirements of ER, necessary to explicitly store previous observations. To remedy this issue, we explore a novel approach, Online Contrastive Divergence with Generative Replay (OCD_GR), which uses the generative capability of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) instead of recorded past experiences. The RBM is trained online, and does not require the system to store any of the observed data points. We compare OCD_GR to ER on 9 real-world datasets, considering a worst-case scenario (data points arriving in sorted order) as well as a more realistic one (sequential random-order data points). Our results show that in 64.28% of the cases OCD_GR outperforms ER and in the remaining 35.72% it has an almost equal performance, while having a considerably reduced space complexity (i.e., memory usage) at a comparable time complexity.",0
"This paper presents a new method called online contrastive divergence (OCD), which combines elements of supervised learning with unsupervised learning by generating artificial training examples using generative replay while simultaneously minimizing error on the actual data. By storing only the last batch of data and discarding previous iterations, OCD eliminates memory bottlenecks that have limited prior implementations of online experience replay like UDAMP or EWC. In addition, our novel algorithm updates parameters end-to-end instead of freezing part of them during pseudo-inverse computation. We evaluate OCD across several computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation and find that our approach achieves significantly better results than strong baselines including LwF, MAS, and SIRA.

"Stochastic linear bandits are a natural and simple generalisation of finite-armed bandits with numerous practical applications. Current approaches focus on generalising existing techniques for finite-armed bandits, notably the optimism principle and Thompson sampling. While prior work has mostly been in the worst-case setting, we analyse the asymptotic instance-dependent regret and show matching upper and lower bounds on what is achievable. Surprisingly, our results show that no algorithm based on optimism or Thompson sampling will ever achieve the optimal rate, and indeed, can be arbitrarily far from optimal, even in very simple cases. This is a disturbing result because these techniques are standard tools that are widely used for sequential optimisation. For example, for generalised linear bandits and reinforcement learning.",0
"This paper presents new insights into the performance of finite-armed linear bandits by analyzing their behavior as time tends towards infinity. We first derive closed-form expressions for the expected regret and cumulative reward of several popular algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and LinUCB. These expressions reveal interesting patterns that were previously unknown in the literature, such as how different arms can behave similarly but have vastly different performances over short horizons. Our results provide new theoretical evidence on the limitations of optimism in multi-arm bandit problems, particularly at shorter timescales where rewards tend to fluctuate more randomly. Furthermore, our work uncovers a counterintuitive relationship between the number of arms and the rate of convergence in terms of regret minimization, which has implications for algorithm design and tuning parameters. Overall, we believe our findings contribute valuable knowledge for practitioners and researchers working on reinforcement learning and bandit theory.",1

"Online model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods with continuous actions are playing a prominent role when dealing with real-world applications such as Robotics. However, when confronted to non-stationary environments, these methods crucially rely on an exploration-exploitation trade-off which is rarely dynamically and automatically adjusted to changes in the environment. Here we propose an active exploration algorithm for RL in structured (parameterized) continuous action space. This framework deals with a set of discrete actions, each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. Discrete exploration is controlled through a Boltzmann softmax function with an inverse temperature $\beta$ parameter. In parallel, a Gaussian exploration is applied to the continuous action parameters. We apply a meta-learning algorithm based on the comparison between variations of short-term and long-term reward running averages to simultaneously tune $\beta$ and the width of the Gaussian distribution from which continuous action parameters are drawn. When applied to a simple virtual human-robot interaction task, we show that this algorithm outperforms continuous parameterized RL both without active exploration and with active exploration based on uncertainty variations measured by a Kalman-Q-learning algorithm.",0
"In this paper we present active exploration in parameterized reinforcement learning (PRL), which introduces exploration bonuses that are adaptive to model parameters.

"Autonomous learning of robotic skills can allow general-purpose robots to learn wide behavioral repertoires without requiring extensive manual engineering. However, robotic skill learning methods typically make one of several trade-offs to enable practical real-world learning, such as requiring manually designed policy or value function representations, initialization from human-provided demonstrations, instrumentation of the training environment, or extremely long training times. In this paper, we propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for learning manipulation skills that can train general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. Our approach builds on the guided policy search (GPS) algorithm, which transforms the reinforcement learning problem into supervised learning from a computational teacher (without human demonstrations). In contrast to prior GPS methods, which require a consistent set of initial states to which the system must be reset after each episode, our approach can handle randomized initial states, allowing it to be used in environments where deterministic resets are impossible. We compare our method to existing policy search techniques in simulation, showing that it can train high-dimensional neural network policies with the same sample efficiency as prior GPS methods, and present real-world results on a PR2 robotic manipulator.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for training agents to perform complex tasks in uncertain environments. One challenging aspect of DRL is the computational cost associated with policy evaluation and optimization, which can require millions of environment interactions even for relatively small problems. To address this issue, we present a new algorithm called ""Reset-free Guided Policy Search"" (RGPS), which utilizes guided policy search techniques to efficiently train policies that achieve high performance without requiring resets or multiple initial states. Our method uses a novel formulation that allows us to quickly evaluate the quality of different policy iterations by leveraging existing data collected from previous interactions with the environment. We demonstrate through experiments on several benchmark domains that RGPS outperforms state-of-the-art DRL algorithms while significantly reducing computation time and sample complexity. Overall, our work shows promise for enabling more efficient and effective use of DRL in real-world applications.",1
"Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.",0
"In deep learning models, dropouts have been shown to reduce overfitting by introducing noise during training, effectively regularizing network weights. While many consider dropouts primarily as a form of data augmentation, others view them as a means of approximating Monte Carlo (MC) sampling from a Bayesian model. This paper presents evidence that supports the latter interpretation, demonstrating how dropouts can serve as an approximation of MC sampling when used within variational inference frameworks. By applying dropout to approximate MC sampling, we show how to more explicitly represent uncertainty in deep learning models. Furthermore, through extensive experiments on three challenging datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN, and CelebA), our results demonstrate significant improvements compared to both non-dropout baselines and alternative ensemble methods designed specifically for improving calibration. Our work thus highlights the utility of using dropouts as a flexible tool in the deep learning practitioner’s toolkit, capable of not only reducing overfitting but also enabling explicit model uncertainty estimation.",1
"In principle, reinforcement learning and policy search methods can enable robots to learn highly complex and general skills that may allow them to function amid the complexity and diversity of the real world. However, training a policy that generalizes well across a wide range of real-world conditions requires far greater quantity and diversity of experience than is practical to collect with a single robot. Fortunately, it is possible for multiple robots to share their experience with one another, and thereby, learn a policy collectively. In this work, we explore distributed and asynchronous policy learning as a means to achieve generalization and improved training times on challenging, real-world manipulation tasks. We propose a distributed and asynchronous version of Guided Policy Search and use it to demonstrate collective policy learning on a vision-based door opening task using four robots. We show that it achieves better generalization, utilization, and training times than the single robot alternative.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training artificial agents to perform complex tasks in uncertain environments. However, many RL algorithms require significant computational resources, making it challenging to scale them up to real-world problems that involve multiple robots working together in large-scale environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel distributed asynchronous guided policy search algorithm that allows multiple robots to learn collaboratively by sharing experiences and guiding their individual exploration based on global rewards. Our approach combines elements of distributed RL, multi-armed bandits, and guided policy search, enabling efficient coordination among the robots while balancing exploration and exploitation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and experiments involving a swarm of robotic ground vehicles searching for targets in a large environment with partial observability. Our results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized RL methods in terms of convergence rate and task completion time, highlighting its potential applications in diverse fields such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and disaster response. Overall, our work contributes to the development of scalable collective RL algorithms that can enable teams of robots to solve complex tasks efficiently and effectively.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) can automate a wide variety of robotic skills, but learning each new skill requires considerable real-world data collection and manual representation engineering to design policy classes or features. Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be decomposed into ""task-specific"" and ""robot-specific"" modules, where the task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information, such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that were not seen during training. Using a novel neural network architecture, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual and non-visual tasks.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning modular neural network policies that can effectively transfer knowledge across multiple tasks and robots. We propose using a multi-task, deep reinforcement learning approach, where each task has its own policy module, but shares common low-level action representations. Our approach allows these modules to communicate and share information during training, allowing them to learn more quickly and efficiently. We demonstrate our method on several robotics domains, including locomotion control and manipulation tasks, showing improved performance compared to standard single-task methods. Our work suggests that modularity may provide a key framework for developing flexible artificial intelligence systems capable of generalizing to new scenarios without explicit retraining. By enabling efficient use of limited data resources, such modular approaches have implications both for real-world applications and as foundations of future advanced machine learning agents.",1
"In this paper we study a model-based approach to calculating approximately optimal policies in Markovian Decision Processes. In particular, we derive novel bounds on the loss of using a policy derived from a factored linear model, a class of models which generalize numerous previous models out of those that come with strong computational guarantees. For the first time in the literature, we derive performance bounds for model-based techniques where the model inaccuracy is measured in weighted norms. Moreover, our bounds show a decreased sensitivity to the discount factor and, unlike similar bounds derived for other approaches, they are insensitive to measure mismatch. Similarly to previous works, our proofs are also based on contraction arguments, but with the main differences that we use carefully constructed norms building on Banach lattices, and the contraction property is only assumed for operators acting on ""compressed"" spaces, thus weakening previous assumptions, while strengthening previous results.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), uncertainty can arise due to model errors which may lead the agent to take suboptimal actions that negatively affect performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach using policy error bounds based on factored linear models (FLMs). Our method uses FLMs to represent the transition probability function used by the RL algorithm, allowing us to derive upper bounds on the error caused by any deviations from the true dynamics. These bounds provide a safe region within which the agent can operate while ensuring satisfaction of predefined constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in both discrete-time Markov decision processes and continuous state spaces. Our results show significant improvement over existing methods, including model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. This work contributes to the field by providing a theoretical foundation for robust RL under model uncertainties and paves the way for future research in developing practical algorithms for real-world applications.",1
"The recent advances in deep neural networks have led to effective vision-based reinforcement learning methods that have been employed to obtain human-level controllers in Atari 2600 games from pixel data. Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the first-person perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical first-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results confirm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic first-person perspective environments is feasible.",0

Visual reinforcement learning (VRL) is rapidly gaining popularity due to the recent breakthroughs achieved by deep RL algorithms in computer vision tasks such as Atari games [2], robotic manipulation challenges [4] and 3D maze navigation [7]. Among other advantages, VRL agents can learn more efficiently than textual feedback based methods [8] because they directly observe images that represent their current state and reward signals. Consequently, building research platforms that enable scientists and engineers to experiment with new VRL approaches on classic tasks from DeepMind’s control suite [1] and beyond has become increasingly important. In this paper we present ViZDoom - an extension of the famous first person shooter game Doom [9][10][6][11],[12](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vm/doom/) into a versatile AI research platform designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of modern VRL algorithms. We demonstrate how our novel architecture equips existing VizDoom [3] with advanced features specifically tailored towards the needs of researchers engaged in developing VRL solutions [8]: (a) easy replacement of the original agent with lightweight models designed to run within Doom’s limited computational budget, enabling rapid prototyping; (b) integration of powerful third party deep neural network libraries like Tensorflow [5]; (c) seamless training without changing existing game logic, allowing benchmark comparison against prior results using published hyperparameters; and (d) efficient parallel computing across multiple GPUs through asynchronous actions and intermittent rendering. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence showing that utilizing these capabilities together allows us to train several successful deep VRL agents on a selection of games from t",1
"Opponent modeling is necessary in multi-agent settings where secondary agents with competing goals also adapt their strategies, yet it remains challenging because strategies interact with each other and change. Most previous work focuses on developing probabilistic models or parameterized strategies for specific applications. Inspired by the recent success of deep reinforcement learning, we present neural-based models that jointly learn a policy and the behavior of opponents. Instead of explicitly predicting the opponent's action, we encode observation of the opponents into a deep Q-Network (DQN); however, we retain explicit modeling (if desired) using multitasking. By using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, our model automatically discovers different strategy patterns of opponents without extra supervision. We evaluate our models on a simulated soccer game and a popular trivia game, showing superior performance over DQN and its variants.",0
"Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex decision making problems in artificial intelligence. However, one major challenge faced by DRL agents is their lack of awareness about other agents present in the environment, known as opponents. Opponent modeling refers to the process of understanding the behavior and intentions of these opponents, which can greatly improve the performance of DRL agents. In this work, we propose a framework for incorporating opponent modeling into deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Our approach leverages recent advances in neural networks and machine learning to build accurate models of the opponents based on observations of their actions. We evaluate our method using simulation studies that demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods that neglect opponent modeling. These results have important implications for applications of DRL such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems. Our work represents an initial step towards building intelligent DRL agents that can interact effectively with multiple opponents in dynamic environments.",1
"Two less addressed issues of deep reinforcement learning are (1) lack of generalization capability to new target goals, and (2) data inefficiency i.e., the model requires several (and often costly) episodes of trial and error to converge, which makes it impractical to be applied to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address these two issues and apply our model to the task of target-driven visual navigation. To address the first issue, we propose an actor-critic model whose policy is a function of the goal as well as the current state, which allows to better generalize. To address the second issue, we propose AI2-THOR framework, which provides an environment with high-quality 3D scenes and physics engine. Our framework enables agents to take actions and interact with objects. Hence, we can collect a huge number of training samples efficiently.   We show that our proposed method (1) converges faster than the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, (2) generalizes across targets and across scenes, (3) generalizes to a real robot scenario with a small amount of fine-tuning (although the model is trained in simulation), (4) is end-to-end trainable and does not need feature engineering, feature matching between frames or 3D reconstruction of the environment.

"In this work, we propose a target-driven visual navigation approach that uses deep reinforcement learning to enable robots to navigate through indoor scenes. Our method leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn representations from raw sensor data, which are then used to predict actions at each time step. We formulate navigation as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the robot must balance exploration and exploitation to achieve a specified goal. To solve the MDP, we use proximal policy optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art actor-critic algorithm that has shown to be effective in solving complex control problems. Experiments conducted on several challenging indoor environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to traditional vision-based methods. Overall, our work shows promise in enabling robots to efficiently navigate unstructured indoor spaces using only visual input.",1
"Learning to solve complex sequences of tasks--while both leveraging transfer and avoiding catastrophic forgetting--remains a key obstacle to achieving human-level intelligence. The progressive networks approach represents a step forward in this direction: they are immune to forgetting and can leverage prior knowledge via lateral connections to previously learned features. We evaluate this architecture extensively on a wide variety of reinforcement learning tasks (Atari and 3D maze games), and show that it outperforms common baselines based on pretraining and finetuning. Using a novel sensitivity measure, we demonstrate that transfer occurs at both low-level sensory and high-level control layers of the learned policy.",0
"Progressive neural networks (PNN) is a class of deep learning architectures designed to effectively balance progressiveness and expressiveness in modeling complex data distributions. By introducing novel training mechanisms that adaptively adjust network capacity based on the task at hand, PNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets while requiring fewer parameters compared to traditional deep learning models. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of PNNs, including analysis of their unique properties and comparisons against leading baseline approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that PNNs consistently outperform prior methods, establishing them as a powerful alternative for designing effective deep learning systems. We conclude by discussing future research directions centered on advancing our understanding of progressiveness and expressiveness in deep learning, ultimately driving further improvements in artificial intelligence.",1
"Understanding and using natural processes for intelligent functionalities, referred to as natural intelligence, has recently attracted interest from a variety of fields, including post-silicon computing for artificial intelligence and decision making in the behavioural sciences. In a past study, we successfully used the wave-particle duality of single photons to solve the two-armed bandit problem, which constitutes the foundation of reinforcement learning and decision making. In this study, we propose and confirm a hierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and decision making that verifies the scalability of the principle. Specifically, the four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a two-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted in order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements. In the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges. The optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however, conflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while what we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the probabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the optimal solution even for contradictive problems, hence manifesting the exploration ability of single photons. This study provides insights into photon intelligence in hierarchical architectures for future artificial intelligence as well as the potential of natural processes for intelligent functionalities.",0
"This paper proposes using single photons in hierarchical architectures for implementing physical reinforcement learning agents that learn directly from the real world through sensorimultaneously at every level of abstraction. We present two novel ideas, namely, “Photon Intelligence” and “Hierarchical Sensorimulation”. These ideas enable us to design efficient, scalable, and versatile learning algorithms for single photon processing by leveraging recent advances in quantum computing and deep learning technologies. Our approach empowers small numbers of qubits to interact with low rates of environmental signals, such as individual photons, providing advantages in terms of energy consumption and miniaturization while allowing for highly expressive policy representations in continuous action spaces. By operating on principles similar to those observed in biological vision systems, our work sets a foundation for studying how living organisms might solve complex tasks without relying on digital data structures and high computational demands. The obtained results establish new frontiers for exploring brain-inspired hardware and software designs capable of tackling challenging problems across various disciplines like robotics, computer graphics, game theory, and scientific discovery.",1
"Sample efficiency is a critical property when optimizing policy parameters for the controller of a robot. In this paper, we evaluate two state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms. One is a recent deep reinforcement learning method based on an actor-critic algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), that has been shown to perform well on various control benchmarks. The other one is a direct policy search method, Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), a black-box optimization method that is widely used for robot learning. The algorithms are evaluated on a continuous version of the mountain car benchmark problem, so as to compare their sample complexity. From a preliminary analysis, we expect DDPG to be more sample efficient than CMA-ES, which is confirmed by our experimental results.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as one of the most successful approaches in artificial intelligence. This work compares two popular methods used in deep reinforcement learning: actor-critic and direct policy search. We show that these methods have different characteristics in terms of their sample efficiency and can lead to significant differences in performance depending on the problem at hand. Our analysis identifies the key components driving the difference in performance, such as credit assignment mechanisms and the use of function approximators. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence indicating that certain problems exhibit either high or low sample complexity due to intrinsic properties of the environment and agent. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, allowing researchers to select the appropriate method according to their specific requirements.",1
"A recent goal in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework is to choose a sequence of actions or a policy to maximize the reward collected or minimize the regret incurred in a finite time horizon. For several RL problems in operation research and optimal control, the optimal policy of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) is characterized by a known structure. The current state of the art algorithms do not utilize this known structure of the optimal policy while minimizing regret. In this work, we develop new RL algorithms that exploit the structure of the optimal policy to minimize regret. Numerical experiments on MDPs with structured optimal policies show that our algorithms have better performance, are easy to implement, have a smaller run-time and require less number of random number generations.",0
"This research paper proposes novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for minimizing cumulative regret in structured Markov decision processes (SMDPs). We consider two different approaches for computing near-optimal policies: value iteration (VI) and policy iteration (PI). Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: \begin{enumerate} \item For VI-based methods, we design new RL algorithms that take advantage of the structure inherent to SMDPs. These algorithms rely on linear programming formulations to find approximate solutions to the value function updates, which greatly reduces computational complexity without compromising solution quality. Additionally, we show how to incorporate exploration into our method by sampling actions according to a probabilistic distribution over all possible actions at each state visitation.  \item For PI-based methods, we introduce a new algorithm called REGAL (Regret Minimization via Policy Improvement), which iteratively improves a stochastic policy greedily chosen based on the current estimate of the value function. We prove that REGAL converges to a solution with finite expected regret under mild assumptions, while maintaining polynomial time complexity. Further, our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both efficiency and accuracy compared to existing RL algorithms designed for general MDPs. \end{enumerate} This work advances the state of the art in developing effective and efficient RL algorithms tailored specifically to structured problems. By leveraging the underlying structure present in many realworld applications, our proposed algorithms offer promising solutions for achieving better performance than current generic techniques.",1
"Most learning algorithms are not invariant to the scale of the function that is being approximated. We propose to adaptively normalize the targets used in learning. This is useful in value-based reinforcement learning, where the magnitude of appropriate value approximations can change over time when we update the policy of behavior. Our main motivation is prior work on learning to play Atari games, where the rewards were all clipped to a predetermined range. This clipping facilitates learning across many different games with a single learning algorithm, but a clipped reward function can result in qualitatively different behavior. Using the adaptive normalization we can remove this domain-specific heuristic without diminishing overall performance.",0
"""Learning from human feedback has enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform well on specific tasks within narrow contexts; however, applying these systems beyond their original context can lead to unexpected outcomes that violate ethical standards.

Our approach draws upon recent advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and meta-learning, combining them into a single system called ValueSetNet. We evaluate our model using real-world case studies in robotics and autonomous driving, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing safety and efficiency requirements under dynamic conditions.""",1
"Control of non-episodic, finite-horizon dynamical systems with uncertain dynamics poses a tough and elementary case of the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Bayesian reinforcement learning, reasoning about the effect of actions and future observations, offers a principled solution, but is intractable. We review, then extend an old approximate approach from control theory---where the problem is known as dual control---in the context of modern regression methods, specifically generalized linear regression. Experiments on simulated systems show that this framework offers a useful approximation to the intractable aspects of Bayesian RL, producing structured exploration strategies that differ from standard RL approaches. We provide simple examples for the use of this framework in (approximate) Gaussian process regression and feedforward neural networks for the control of exploration.",0
"Dual control refers to dual process theories which posit that cognition emerges from both automatic and controlled processes (cf., Botvinick & Plaut, 2010). This approach may facilitate reinforcement learning by making better use of past experience. We introduce a new algorithm called DualControl which uses high variance policies as exploration bonuses on top of a basic policy learned via REINFORCE with advantage estimates. We evaluate our algorithm on standard continuous control tasks and observe clear improvements over state-of-the art algorithms. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jerfelix/dualcontrol .",1
"One of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to complex robotic control tasks is the need to gather large amounts of experience in order to find an effective policy for the task at hand. Model-based reinforcement learning can achieve good sample efficiency, but requires the ability to learn a model of the dynamics that is good enough to learn an effective policy. In this work, we develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that combines prior knowledge from previous tasks with online adaptation of the dynamics model. These two ingredients enable highly sample-efficient learning even in regimes where estimating the true dynamics is very difficult, since the online model adaptation allows the method to locally compensate for unmodeled variation in the dynamics. We encode the prior experience into a neural network dynamics model, adapt it online by progressively refitting a local linear model of the dynamics, and use model predictive control to plan under these dynamics. Our experimental results show that this approach can be used to solve a variety of complex robotic manipulation tasks in just a single attempt, using prior data from other manipulation behaviors.",0
"This should describe what was done in the paper without repeating any section titles from the main document. No specifics on the model itself (if you could mention it once that would be fine), or details of implementation. Just a description of how they approached learning manipulation skills via online adaptation based on neural network priors. If possible, explain why their method works better than previous methods in a few sentences at the end. Thanks! --- In this work we present a novel approach to learning complex manipulation tasks using deep reinforcement learning. Our method combines several key components that together enable efficient learning even under challenging conditions such as sparse rewards and high-dimensional state spaces. Firstly, we employ a one-shot imitation learning stage to pre-train our agent in a supervised manner on expert demonstrations. Secondly, during interaction with the environment, we perform online dynamics adaptation to account for changes in the environment over time. Finally, we incorporate prior knowledge into our policy optimization process through the use of neural network priors derived from human domain experience. We show that these components combined lead to substantial improvement over traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling agents to learn both faster and more robustly in difficult domains. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse sources of knowledge in order to achieve effective lifelong learning.",1
"This is a brief technical note to clarify the state of lower bounds on regret for reinforcement learning. In particular, this paper:   - Reproduces a lower bound on regret for reinforcement learning, similar to the result of Theorem 5 in the journal UCRL2 paper (Jaksch et al 2010).   - Clarifies that the proposed proof of Theorem 6 in the REGAL paper (Bartlett and Tewari 2009) does not hold using the standard techniques without further work. We suggest that this result should instead be considered a conjecture as it has no rigorous proof.   - Suggests that the conjectured lower bound given by (Bartlett and Tewari 2009) is incorrect and, in fact, it is possible to improve the scaling of the upper bound to match the weaker lower bounds presented in this paper.   We hope that this note serves to clarify existing results in the field of reinforcement learning and provides interesting motivation for future work.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), regret is often used as a measure of how well a policy performs over time, compared to other policies that could have been chosen instead. However, little has been known about lower bounds on regret, which can shed light on the fundamental limits of RL algorithms. This paper presents new results on lower bounds for regret in several important classes of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We show that certain popular algorithms, such as Q-learning and SARSA, suffer from high regret even under very favorable conditions, while more advanced algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search achieve sublinear regret only under specific assumptions. Our findings highlight the difficulties faced by RL algorithms in solving MDPs optimally, and suggest promising directions for future research into achieving better performance guarantees.",1
"This is a brief technical note to clarify some of the issues with applying the application of the algorithm posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) in environments without fixed episodes. In particular, this paper aims to:   - Review some of results which have been proven for finite horizon MDPs (Osband et al 2013, 2014a, 2014b, 2016) and also for MDPs with finite ergodic structure (Gopalan et al 2014).   - Review similar results for optimistic algorithms in infinite horizon problems (Jaksch et al 2010, Bartlett and Tewari 2009, Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvari 2011), with particular attention to the dynamic episode growth.   - Highlight the delicate technical issue which has led to a fault in the proof of the lazy-PSRL algorithm (Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvari 2015). We present an explicit counterexample to this style of argument. Therefore, we suggest that the Theorem 2 in (Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvari 2015) be instead considered a conjecture, as it has no rigorous proof.   - Present pragmatic approaches to apply PSRL in infinite horizon problems. We conjecture that, under some additional assumptions, it will be possible to obtain bounds $O( \sqrt{T} )$ even without episodic reset.   We hope that this note serves to clarify existing results in the field of reinforcement learning and provides interesting motivation for future work.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training agents to make decisions in complex environments. However, traditional RL algorithms suffer from several drawbacks that limit their effectiveness in practice. One major issue is the need for large numbers of episodes, which can become prohibitively expensive in terms of both computation time and data usage. Additionally, existing methods often require careful tuning and hand-engineered features to achieve good results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach based on posterior sampling that enables efficient policy optimization without requiring episodes. Our method relies on a probabilistic representation of policies using neural networks and uses variational inference techniques to optimize the parameters of these distributions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through experiments on benchmark control tasks and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational cost.",1
"Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.",0

"Online learning has become crucial to many problems in machine learning. As more data is collected sequentially, quickly adapting to changes in the data distribution can offer several competitive advantages such as avoiding loss of prior knowledge and more efficient learning. However, adaptation to changes in the data distribution (also known as covariate shift) needs to be performed without compromising past knowledge already built in into the model to cope with voluminous and dynamic data. In this paper, we propose an online stacked Denoising Autoencoder whose structure is adapted through reinforcement learning. Our algorithm forces the network to exploit and explore favourable architectures employing an estimated utility function that maximises the accuracy of an unseen validation sequence. Different actions, such as Pool, Increment and Merge are available to modify the structure of the network. As we observe through a series of experiments, our approach is more responsive, robust, and principled than its counterparts for non-stationary as well as stationary data distributions. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm performs better at preserving gained prior knowledge and responding to changes in the data distribution.",0
"Online adaptation can enable deep architectures to learn from data that arrives over time, enabling them to improve their performance on new tasks without being retrained from scratch. However, online adaptation remains challenging due to the difficulty of exploring high dimensional action spaces and solving complex credit assignment problems. We present an approach based on reinforcement learning (RL) that addresses these difficulties. Our method uses RL to guide the search process towards better actions, leveraging offline supervised fine tuning as a guidance signal for policy improvement. In addition, we propose efficient techniques for selecting which neural network parameters to update during each step of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling models to quickly adapt to changes in streamed input distributions.

"Szubert and Jaskowski successfully used temporal difference (TD) learning together with n-tuple networks for playing the game 2048. However, we observed a phenomenon that the programs based on TD learning still hardly reach large tiles. In this paper, we propose multi-stage TD (MS-TD) learning, a kind of hierarchical reinforcement learning method, to effectively improve the performance for the rates of reaching large tiles, which are good metrics to analyze the strength of 2048 programs. Our experiments showed significant improvements over the one without using MS-TD learning. Namely, using 3-ply expectimax search, the program with MS-TD learning reached 32768-tiles with a rate of 18.31%, while the one with TD learning did not reach any. After further tuned, our 2048 program reached 32768-tiles with a rate of 31.75% in 10,000 games, and one among these games even reached a 65536-tile, which is the first ever reaching a 65536-tile to our knowledge. In addition, MS-TD learning method can be easily applied to other 2048-like games, such as Threes.

"Guided policy search algorithms can be used to optimize complex nonlinear policies, such as deep neural networks, without directly computing policy gradients in the high-dimensional parameter space. Instead, these methods use supervised learning to train the policy to mimic a ""teacher"" algorithm, such as a trajectory optimizer or a trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. Guided policy search methods provide asymptotic local convergence guarantees by construction, but it is not clear how much the policy improves within a small, finite number of iterations. We show that guided policy search algorithms can be interpreted as an approximate variant of mirror descent, where the projection onto the constraint manifold is not exact. We derive a new guided policy search algorithm that is simpler and provides appealing improvement and convergence guarantees in simplified convex and linear settings, and show that in the more general nonlinear setting, the error in the projection step can be bounded. We provide empirical results on several simulated robotic navigation and manipulation tasks that show that our method is stable and achieves similar or better performance when compared to prior guided policy search methods, with a simpler formulation and fewer hyperparameters.",0

"We propose a reinforcement learning based approach to tackle the cost-sensitive learning problem where each input feature has a specific cost. The acquisition process is handled through a stochastic policy which allows features to be acquired in an adaptive way. The general architecture of our approach relies on representation learning to enable performing prediction on any partially observed sample, whatever the set of its observed features are. The resulting model is an original mix of representation learning and of reinforcement learning ideas. It is learned with policy gradient techniques to minimize a budgeted inference cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with several experiments on a variety of datasets for the sparse prediction problem where all features have the same cost, but also for some cost-sensitive settings.",0
"""Sequential cost-sensitive feature acquisition"" is a novel approach to machine learning that takes into account both the accuracy of a model and the cost associated with acquiring data for each new feature. This method seeks to balance these two considerations by making sequential decisions on which features to add next, taking into account their estimated impact on accuracy and cost. This allows for more efficient use of resources and can lead to improved overall performance compared to traditional methods. The proposed algorithm employs bandit techniques and leverages upper confidence bounds to make informed choices while minimizing risk. Results from experiments using real datasets show promising improvements over existing approaches.

We establish further efficiency and asymptotic performance guarantees that apply even if the true value function does not lie in the given hypothesis class, for the special case where the hypothesis class is the span of pre-specified indicator functions over disjoint sets. We also discuss the computational complexity of OCP and present computational results involving two illustrative examples.",0

They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on several challenging domains, including games such as Pong and Enduro. Overall, they show that their technique can significantly increase both exploration speed and final performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.  ---  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in modern society due to its ability to make complex decisions based on large amounts of data.

"Many real-world applications can be described as large-scale games of imperfect information. To deal with these challenging domains, prior work has focused on computing Nash equilibria in a handcrafted abstraction of the domain. In this paper we introduce the first scalable end-to-end approach to learning approximate Nash equilibria without prior domain knowledge. Our method combines fictitious self-play with deep reinforcement learning. When applied to Leduc poker, Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approached a Nash equilibrium, whereas common reinforcement learning methods diverged. In Limit Texas Holdem, a poker game of real-world scale, NFSP learnt a strategy that approached the performance of state-of-the-art, superhuman algorithms based on significant domain expertise.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable successes in achieving human level performance on a variety of challenging problems such as Go game, Dota games etc . These state-of-the-art methods mostly rely on full observability (perfect information), which means that both players have complete knowledge of the current game state at each time step during training. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches in perfect-information scenarios, there exists little work on applying RL algorithms in imperfect-information domains where information is only partially observable, and actions taken by one player can affect future observations available to the other player. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework based on self-play learning with neural function approximation. We show that our approach is able to achieve superhuman performance compared against strong Monte Carlo Tree Search baselines on three different popular imperfect-information benchmark domains: poker-games, tic-tac-toe games and GVG-AI competition. Moreover, through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate how our design choices contribute significantly towards better performance gains over the corresponding board games domains played under full observability (i.e., perfect-information).

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a trending field of research, showing great promise in many challenging problems such as playing Atari, solving Go and controlling robots. While DRL agents perform well in practice we are still missing the tools to analayze their performance and visualize the temporal abstractions that they learn. In this paper, we present a novel method that automatically discovers an internal Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model in the Deep Q Network's (DQN) learned representation. We suggest a novel visualization method that represents the SMDP model by a directed graph and visualize it above a t-SNE map. We show how can we interpret the agent's policy and give evidence for the hierarchical state aggregation that DQNs are learning automatically. Our algorithm is fully automatic, does not require any domain specific knowledge and is evaluated by a novel likelihood based evaluation criteria.",0
"This could be one possible solution: ""The analysis of large high-dimensional data sets often requires dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). These methods allow researchers to visualize complex relationships within their data by creating two- or three-dimensional representations of them. However, they can sometimes fail to capture important dynamic processes that occur over time, leading to static depictions instead of more accurate ones. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called SEMI-MDPs (Stochastic Energy Minimization on Information Matrix Partial MDP) which integrates dynamics into the embedding process. Using both real-world examples and simulations, we demonstrate how SEMI-MDPs can better reveal hidden temporal structures compared to traditional approaches like t-SNE. Our findings suggest that incorporating dynamics into dimension reduction may improve our understanding of complex systems, making SEMI-MDPs a valuable tool for many scientific fields.""",1
"The notion of approachability was introduced by Blackwell [1] in the context of vector-valued repeated games. The famous Blackwell's approachability theorem prescribes a strategy for approachability, i.e., for `steering' the average cost of a given agent towards a given target set, irrespective of the strategies of the other agents. In this paper, motivated by the multi-objective optimization/decision making problems in dynamically changing environments, we address the approachability problem in Stackelberg stochastic games with vector valued cost functions. We make two main contributions. Firstly, we give a simple and computationally tractable strategy for approachability for Stackelberg stochastic games along the lines of Blackwell's. Secondly, we give a reinforcement learning algorithm for learning the approachable strategy when the transition kernel is unknown. We also recover as a by-product Blackwell's necessary and sufficient condition for approachability for convex sets in this set up and thus a complete characterization. We also give sufficient conditions for non-convex sets.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to modeling approachability in games with vector costs under uncertainty. We extend the existing framework of Stackelberg stochastic games by introducing vector cost functions, which capture variation in cost across different dimensions or strategies. In doing so, we develop an approach that allows us to analyze how players adjust their behavior as they learn about the distribution of payoffs over time. Our results provide insight into the conditions under which cooperative solutions can emerge, even when there exists significant uncertainty about future payoff distributions. By considering both static and dynamic approaches, our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of learning in shaping equilibrium outcomes in uncertain environments. Overall, our findings contribute to ongoing research at the intersection of game theory, decision making, and economics, highlighting the critical importance of incorporating uncertainty into models of human behavior.",1

"State of the art deep reinforcement learning algorithms take many millions of interactions to attain human-level performance. Humans, on the other hand, can very quickly exploit highly rewarding nuances of an environment upon first discovery. In the brain, such rapid learning is thought to depend on the hippocampus and its capacity for episodic memory. Here we investigate whether a simple model of hippocampal episodic control can learn to solve difficult sequential decision-making tasks. We demonstrate that it not only attains a highly rewarding strategy significantly faster than state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms, but also achieves a higher overall reward on some of the more challenging domains.",0
"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in many domains, including robotics and computer vision. One area that has seen particular success is episodic control, which refers to the ability of agents to plan actions based on their past experiences. Traditionally, episodic control relies heavily on modeling the environment, predicting possible outcomes, and making decisions accordingly. However, this approach can be computationally expensive and may lead to suboptimal results if the assumptions used in the model prove incorrect. This paper presents a novel method for episodic control that doesn't require explicit models of the environment or other external knowledge sources. Our algorithm uses only raw sensory data as input, allowing for efficient planning and decision-making directly from perception. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a range of experiments across multiple tasks and environments, showing that our agent consistently achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods reliant on explicit modeling. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the development of autonomous AI systems capable of complex reasoning and adaptive behavior in real-world situations.",1
"Consider learning a policy from example expert behavior, without interaction with the expert or access to reinforcement signal. One approach is to recover the expert's cost function with inverse reinforcement learning, then extract a policy from that cost function with reinforcement learning. This approach is indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly extracting a policy from data, as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning. We show that a certain instantiation of our framework draws an analogy between imitation learning and generative adversarial networks, from which we derive a model-free imitation learning algorithm that obtains significant performance gains over existing model-free methods in imitating complex behaviors in large, high-dimensional environments.",0
"In order for Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents to act effectively under uncertain circumstances and unknown environments, they require adaptability and robustness that allow them to learn from observations, such as human demonstrations or expert trajectories, in real time and in response to new situations. This has led to the development of imitation learning techniques, which enable machines to mimic actions performed by humans to achieve desired goals in complex tasks, such as navigation in robotics applications. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), first proposed by Ho et al. in 2016, combines elements of both generative models and adversarial networks into the framework of imitation learning. GAIL trains a neural network, called the generator, to predict state transitions that match those observed in expert demonstration data. This objective function minimization process helps reduce errors between predicted and actual states at each step. Another model, called the discriminator, works concurrently against the generator, attempting to distinguish real states from generated ones. By iteratively updating both models based on policy gradient theory, improved performance can be achieved while reducing the amount of training data required for stable convergence. The application of GAIL extends beyond traditional task completion problems; researchers have demonstrated successful use cases for games such as Montezuma’s Revenge, Chain Gang Challenge, and even Go-playing robots. Nonetheless, limitations remain in terms of generalizing across multiple tasks without retraining individual task policies, as well as addressing challenges related to multi-task settings where shared dynamics may exist among different control functions. Future work should focus on mitigating these concerns through modifications to current architectures or exploring alternative approaches altogether. Overall, the introduction of GAIL represents a significant advancement in improving machine autonomy through imitating experts in high-dimensional state spaces. Despite ongoing developments and potential drawbacks, initial success suggests promising prospects for further progress in expanding the capabilities of modern artificial agents.",1
"Learning robust value functions given raw observations and rewards is now possible with model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms. There is a third alternative, called Successor Representations (SR), which decomposes the value function into two components -- a reward predictor and a successor map. The successor map represents the expected future state occupancy from any given state and the reward predictor maps states to scalar rewards. The value function of a state can be computed as the inner product between the successor map and the reward weights. In this paper, we present DSR, which generalizes SR within an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework. DSR has several appealing properties including: increased sensitivity to distal reward changes due to factorization of reward and world dynamics, and the ability to extract bottleneck states (subgoals) given successor maps trained under a random policy. We show the efficacy of our approach on two diverse environments given raw pixel observations -- simple grid-world domains (MazeBase) and the Doom game engine.",0
"Here is one possible example: --- Artificial intelligence agents that learn through trial and error often use reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to maximize their rewards by taking actions in an environment. One key challenge in RL is how to deal with the possibility of finding different solutions to a problem during training versus testing. This phenomenon, known as ""generalization gap,"" can lead to poor performance on new episodes even after reaching high rewards on previous ones. In order to address this issue, we propose deep successor representation (DSR), which uses deep neural networks to encode states into fixed-size representations called successors. DSR enables agents to learn generalized value functions that bridge the generalization gap and perform well across different environments. Our experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in several benchmark tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, this work advances the field of RL towards achieving more reliable and robust agent behavior.",1

"We present weight normalization: a reparameterization of the weight vectors in a neural network that decouples the length of those weight vectors from their direction. By reparameterizing the weights in this way we improve the conditioning of the optimization problem and we speed up convergence of stochastic gradient descent. Our reparameterization is inspired by batch normalization but does not introduce any dependencies between the examples in a minibatch. This means that our method can also be applied successfully to recurrent models such as LSTMs and to noise-sensitive applications such as deep reinforcement learning or generative models, for which batch normalization is less well suited. Although our method is much simpler, it still provides much of the speed-up of full batch normalization. In addition, the computational overhead of our method is lower, permitting more optimization steps to be taken in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on applications in supervised image recognition, generative modelling, and deep reinforcement learning.",0
"This paper presents weight normalization as a simple reparameterization technique that can significantly accelerate training of deep neural networks (DNN). In contrast to batch normalization, which has been widely adopted in DNNs, weight normalization works by scaling each layer's input by learned scalars such that the mean of each activation becomes one. This reparameterizes each layer's output activations and their corresponding gradients, enabling efficient backpropagation through deep networks. Experimental results on a wide range of tasks show that using weight normalization achieves faster convergence rates compared to both batch normalization and the unnormalized baseline. Additionally, we observe improvements in accuracy across different architectures, including ResNet, VGG, U-net, and Transformer models. Our findings suggest that weight normalization should become standard practice in training modern machine learning models.",1
"Future advancements in robot autonomy and sophistication of robotics tasks rest on robust, efficient, and task-dependent semantic understanding of the environment. Semantic segmentation is the problem of simultaneous segmentation and categorization of a partition of sensory data. The majority of current approaches tackle this using multi-class segmentation and labeling in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework or by generating multiple object hypotheses and combining them sequentially. In practical settings, the subset of semantic labels that are needed depend on the task and particular scene and labelling every single pixel is not always necessary. We pursue these observations in developing a more modular and flexible approach to multi-class parsing of RGBD data based on learning strategies for combining independent binary object-vs-background segmentations in place of the usual monolithic multi-label CRF approach. Parameters for the independent binary segmentation models can be learned very efficiently, and the combination strategy---learned using reinforcement learning---can be set independently and can vary over different tasks and environments. Accuracy is comparable to state-of-art methods on a subset of the NYU-V2 dataset of indoor scenes, while providing additional flexibility and modularity.",0
"In recent years, advances in deep learning have enabled the development of high-performance semantic segmentation models that can accurately predict pixel-wise labels for outdoor scenes.

Our approach involves designing a custom RL environment that simulates realistic indoor scenarios and provides feedback on segmentation performance. We then use state-of-the-art RL algorithms to optimize our model's parameters based on this feedback, encouraging it to make accurate predictions while minimizing errors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved segmentation accuracy compared to several strong baseline models on multiple benchmark datasets. Overall, our work represents an important step towards enabling reliable semantic segmentation in complex indoor settings.",1

Our algorithm is suitable for an important class of episodic POMDPs. Our approach builds on recent advances in method of moments for latent variable model estimation.",0
"An episodic partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model extends traditional POMDP models by defining episodes that have a fixed horizon and are repeated over time steps within each episode. These horizons can differ from one another in length and/or reward structure.

This issue becomes more severe under partial observability which requires larger state spaces at each step. Recent years have seen growing interest in using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to solve large scale sequential decision making problems like ours. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an on-policy actor critic algorithm based on trust region optimization. We propose augmenting classical DRL objectives by adding importance weighted rewards tied to specific states so as to balance optimism in face of uncertainty and exploitation of previously gained knowledge. We apply our approach to two well studied benchmark domains: the classic mountain car problem and a recently introduced stochastic version of the cartpole problem called CART-POLE where random shocks affect the pole's position in addition to the environment's usual stochasticity due to numerical errors. Our results show improvements upon recent state-of-the-art performance across all metrics considered in both environments while also providing better sample complexity.",1
"Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary difficulty arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2) the classic ATARI game `Montezuma's Revenge'.",0

We explore how inverse optimal control (IOC) can be used to learn behaviors from demonstrations, with applications to torque control of high-dimensional robotic systems. Our method addresses two key challenges in inverse optimal control: first, the need for informative features and effective regularization to impose structure on the cost, and second, the difficulty of learning the cost function under unknown dynamics for high-dimensional continuous systems. To address the former challenge, we present an algorithm capable of learning arbitrary nonlinear cost functions, such as neural networks, without meticulous feature engineering. To address the latter challenge, we formulate an efficient sample-based approximation for MaxEnt IOC. We evaluate our method on a series of simulated tasks and real-world robotic manipulation problems, demonstrating substantial improvement over prior methods both in terms of task complexity and sample efficiency.",0
"Here we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that combines inverse optimal control methods with policy optimization techniques. This method learns a cost function using guided policy search, which helps balance exploration and exploitation during training. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results show that our approach can learn complex policies efficiently while achieving high performance even when there is little data available. Additionally, we analyze the learned policies and show how they relate to human behavior. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of combining inverse optimal control with deep learning methods as a promising direction for future research in artificial intelligence.",1
"In imitation learning, an agent learns how to behave in an environment with an unknown cost function by mimicking expert demonstrations. Existing imitation learning algorithms typically involve solving a sequence of planning or reinforcement learning problems. Such algorithms are therefore not directly applicable to large, high-dimensional environments, and their performance can significantly degrade if the planning problems are not solved to optimality. Under the apprenticeship learning formalism, we develop alternative model-free algorithms for finding a parameterized stochastic policy that performs at least as well as an expert policy on an unknown cost function, based on sample trajectories from the expert. Our approach, based on policy gradients, scales to large continuous environments with guaranteed convergence to local minima.",0
"One of the main challenges in training machine learning models to imitate human behavior is finding effective ways to optimize their policies. Existing methods often rely on modeling human actions as well as explicitly designing reward functions, which can be time-consuming and may lead to suboptimal results. In this work, we present a novel approach called Model-Free Imitation Learning with Policy Optimization (MFPA) that addresses these issues by directly optimizing policies without requiring explicit modeling or reward shaping. Our method leverages off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms to update policies based on trajectories generated by a replay buffer. We show through experiments across various domains that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both sample efficiency and final performance. MFPA provides a promising direction towards efficient imitation learning for artificial intelligence agents.",1
"We study the problem of off-policy value evaluation in reinforcement learning (RL), where one aims to estimate the value of a new policy based on data collected by a different policy. This problem is often a critical step when applying RL in real-world problems. Despite its importance, existing general methods either have uncontrolled bias or suffer high variance. In this work, we extend the doubly robust estimator for bandits to sequential decision-making problems, which gets the best of both worlds: it is guaranteed to be unbiased and can have a much lower variance than the popular importance sampling estimators. We demonstrate the estimator's accuracy in several benchmark problems, and illustrate its use as a subroutine in safe policy improvement. We also provide theoretical results on the hardness of the problem, and show that our estimator can match the lower bound in certain scenarios.",0
"This paper presents a new method for evaluating the value function in reinforcement learning that combines two different approaches: on-policy evaluation and off-policy estimation. This ""doubly robust"" approach ensures that the estimated value function remains consistent even if either one of the methods provides inconsistent results. The proposed method relies on both the state occupancy ratio, which is obtained from on-policy data, and the average return estimate, which is obtained using off-policy data. By combining these two sources of information, we can ensure the accuracy of our estimates while minimizing errors caused by biases in either of the underlying models. Our experiments show that this doubly robust approach leads to more accurate value function estimates than existing techniques, especially when only small amounts of data are available. Additionally, our method exhibits good performance even under complex reward functions. Overall, the doulby robust approach paves the way towards better understanding of the role of value functions in RL and how they relate to human decision making processes.",1
"Artificial intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to achieve goals in the world. In the reinforcement learning framework, goals are encoded as reward functions that guide agent behaviour, and the sum of observed rewards provide a notion of progress. However, some domains have no such reward signal, or have a reward signal so sparse as to appear absent. Without reward feedback, agent behaviour is typically random, often dithering aimlessly and lacking intentionality. In this paper we present an algorithm capable of learning purposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds by constructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identification of purposes that are ""just out of reach"" of the agent's current behaviour. These purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimately resulting in a suite of behaviours that encourage the agent to visit different parts of the state space. Moreover, the approach is particularly suited for settings where rewards are very sparse, and such behaviours can help in the exploration of the environment until reward is observed.",0

"Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that can be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed in a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with backpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for applications which require the network to read from extremely large memories. On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to train than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to incorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference procedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various state-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on SimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.",0
"Memory networks have emerged as a popular approach to sequence modeling by using external memory modules to attend over previously read input elements. These systems typically use simple recurrent connections between memories that can lead to difficulties in handling very large datasets where memories interact recursively. Here we present hierarchical memory networks (HMN), a novel architecture that addresses these limitations by organizing memories into multiple levels and enabling selective attention at each level. Our results show consistent improvements over baseline models across several tasks including machine translation and question answering on a variety of benchmark datasets. We analyze the performance gains contributed by different components of our HMN design, showing that hierarchical organization improves data efficiency and attention mechanisms better resolve interactions among memories. We discuss implications for further developments in memory network architectures. -----  Abstract: In recent years, memory networks have gained significant traction in the field of natural language processing due to their ability to effectively process sequential inputs by attending over previously encountered words or phrases stored in external memory modules. However, traditional memory networks suffer from limitations such as difficulty handling very large datasets, issues with recursive dependencies between memories, and suboptimal performances in complex task settings. This work introduces hierarchical memory networks (HMN), which address these shortcomings through organizing memories into multiple levels and implementing selective attention mechanisms at each level. Experimental evaluations across various NLP benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art memory network models, while detailed analyses reveal that hierarchical organization leads to increased data efficiency and effective resolution of interdependencies between memories via attention mechanisms. Overall, HMN represents a promising direction for future advancements in memory network architectures in NLP.",1
"A key challenge in fine-grained recognition is how to find and represent discriminative local regions. Recent attention models are capable of learning discriminative region localizers only from category labels with reinforcement learning. However, not utilizing any explicit part information, they are not able to accurately find multiple distinctive regions. In this work, we introduce an attribute-guided attention localization scheme where the local region localizers are learned under the guidance of part attribute descriptions. By designing a novel reward strategy, we are able to learn to locate regions that are spatially and semantically distinctive with reinforcement learning algorithm. The attribute labeling requirement of the scheme is more amenable than the accurate part location annotation required by traditional part-based fine-grained recognition methods. Experimental results on the CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme on both fine-grained recognition and attribute recognition.",0
"A localization problem can often arise when attempting to perform fine-grained recognition tasks such as species classification in images of plants. One approach that has been developed to tackle these issues is attribute-guided attention (AGA) localization, which leverages human annotations of specific attributes relevant to each image class. In our research, we present Attribute-Guided Attention Localization for Fine-Grained Recognition (AGALFGR), which extends previous work on AGA localization through several novel contributions. Firstly, we propose a new formulation of AGA based on mutual exclusivity constraints, allowing us to model dependencies among attributes and enhancing interpretability. Secondly, we introduce a novel regularizer term into AGALFGR designed to promote spatial coherency in object hypotheses. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of AGALFGR compared against other state-of-the-art methods for fine-grained recognition and localization problems, including ones involving plant identification. Overall, AGALFGR represents a significant advancement in the field of fine-grained recognition and provides valuable insights for further research.",1
"Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding reinforcement learning in discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) by deriving tight sample complexity bounds. However, in many real-world applications, an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded period of time, for example tutoring students for exams or handling customer service requests. Such scenarios can often be better treated as episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, for which only looser bounds on the sample complexity exist. A natural notion of sample complexity in this setting is the number of episodes required to guarantee a certain performance with high probability (PAC guarantee). In this paper, we derive an upper PAC bound $\tilde O(\frac{|\mathcal S|^2 |\mathcal A| H^2}{\epsilon^2} \ln\frac 1 \delta)$ and a lower PAC bound $\tilde \Omega(\frac{|\mathcal S| |\mathcal A| H^2}{\epsilon^2} \ln \frac 1 {\delta + c})$ that match up to log-terms and an additional linear dependency on the number of states $|\mathcal S|$. The lower bound is the first of its kind for this setting. Our upper bound leverages Bernstein's inequality to improve on previous bounds for episodic finite-horizon MDPs which have a time-horizon dependency of at least $H^3$.",0
"In the following paper we consider episodic reinforcement learning problems with fixed horizons, where the objective is to achieve high total reward within a predefined time limit. We study the sample complexity of algorithms designed to solve such problems, focusing on settings where both the state space and action space grow exponentially large with problem size. Our main result establishes a near-match upper bound on the number of timesteps required for optimal algorithm performance, which shows that these models can learn effectively with only a logarithmic increase in computational resources as the problem size grows. Along the way, we introduce several new techniques for analyzing the convergence properties of these algorithms under complex conditions, including novel concentration bounds and error propagation analyses. These developments have important implications for the design and implementation of efficient reinforcement learning systems in real-world domains, particularly those characterized by combinatorial search spaces or other sources of exponential complexity. Overall our work represents a significant step forward in understanding the fundamental limits of modern RL methods, highlights their potential applicability to challenging real-world scenarios, and suggests promising directions for future research.",1
"The recently introduced Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm has gained attention as one of the first successful combinations of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. Its promise was demonstrated in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), a challenging framework composed of dozens of Atari 2600 games used to evaluate general competency in AI. It achieved dramatically better results than earlier approaches, showing that its ability to learn good representations is quite robust and general. This paper attempts to understand the principles that underlie DQN's impressive performance and to better contextualize its success. We systematically evaluate the importance of key representational biases encoded by DQN's network by proposing simple linear representations that make use of these concepts. Incorporating these characteristics, we obtain a computationally practical feature set that achieves competitive performance to DQN in the ALE. Besides offering insight into the strengths and weaknesses of DQN, we provide a generic representation for the ALE, significantly reducing the burden of learning a representation for each game. Moreover, we also provide a simple, reproducible benchmark for the sake of comparison to future work in the ALE.",0
"This study examines the use of shallow reinforcement learning for controlling games on the classic Atari gaming console. We compare performance across several different algorithms, including Q-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Proximal Policy Optimization, and others. Our results show that all of these methods can perform well at some tasks, but none dominates all the rest. Furthermore, we find that even simple Q-learning can achieve superhuman levels of control over many Atari games, raising questions about whether these algorithms should actually be considered ""intelligent."" Finally, we argue that future work could focus on using deep RL techniques rather than trying to push shallow models further, as there may be little additional benefit beyond what has already been achieved. Keywords: shallow reinforcement learning; Atari games; comparative evaluation; algorithm benchmarking.",1
"Policy search methods can allow robots to learn control policies for a wide range of tasks, but practical applications of policy search often require hand-engineered components for perception, state estimation, and low-level control. In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: does training the perception and control systems jointly end-to-end provide better performance than training each component separately? To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a partially observed guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a range of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between vision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated comparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of highly effective vision-based policies that can learn directly from raw sensor input without requiring manual feature engineering or task-specific domain knowledge. In contrast to traditional model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that require handcrafted reward functions or dense reward signals, end-to-end training of visuomotor policies enables more efficient and generalizable learning by optimizing complex mappings between high-level tasks and low-level actions. This approach has been successfully applied across diverse domains including robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing. In particular, deep RL methods such as actor-critic models combined with neural network function approximators have shown promising results in controlling both simulated and real robots on challenging tasks. However, existing work still faces several limitations including poor sample efficiency, suboptimal generalization performance, and sensitivity to hyperparameters. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm based on hierarchical multi-agent actor-critic architectures that can effectively train robust visuomotor policies capable of executing multiple interdependent objectives while leveraging recent developments in meta-learning, transfer learning, and adaptive gradient scheduling techniques. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark problems as well as challenging real-world robot manipulation tasks. These findings highlight important new directions for applying machine learning to complex control problems beyond simulation environments.",1
"Policy advice is a transfer learning method where a student agent is able to learn faster via advice from a teacher. However, both this and other reinforcement learning transfer methods have little theoretical analysis. This paper formally defines a setting where multiple teacher agents can provide advice to a student and introduces an algorithm to leverage both autonomous exploration and teacher's advice. Our regret bounds justify the intuition that good teachers help while bad teachers hurt. Using our formalization, we are also able to quantify, for the first time, when negative transfer can occur within such a reinforcement learning setting.",0
"In the field of reinforcement learning (RL), multiple teachers can provide theoretically-grounded policy advice that has been found to improve performance across different domains. By leveraging insights from decision theory and psychology, these teachers offer unique perspectives on how agents should behave in specific situations. This approach has led to significant advances in RL research over the last decade, as well as applications in areas such as robotics, natural language processing, and game playing. One key challenge facing RL algorithms today is negative transfer, which occurs when learned behaviors interfere with performance in new tasks. While some studies have explored methods to mitigate this problem, most approaches focus solely on designing better algorithms. Our work takes a different tack by incorporating theoretical insights into the teaching process itself. Specifically, we propose using multiple teachers who each emphasize distinct aspects of rational behavior. These teachers may highlight considerations related to expected utility maximization, causal reasoning, or other factors relevant to decision making under uncertainty. Together, they offer complementary strategies for minimizing negative transfer while promoting high levels of task generality. Our contributions extend beyond theoretical development to concrete experiments testing our ideas in simple gridworld environments. Across several experiments, agents trained with multiple teachers achieve higher overall returns compared to those without explicit guidance. Moreover, qualitative analysis reveals that these gains result directly from reduced negative transfer effects during learning. Finally, sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of our findings and point toward future extensions of this work. Overall, our results support the notion tha",1
"This work discusses a closed-loop control strategy for complex systems utilizing scarce and streaming data. A discrete embedding space is first built using hash functions applied to the sensor measurements from which a Markov process model is derived, approximating the complex system's dynamics. A control strategy is then learned using reinforcement learning once rewards relevant with respect to the control objective are identified. This method is designed for experimental configurations, requiring no computations nor prior knowledge of the system, and enjoys intrinsic robustness. It is illustrated on two systems: the control of the transitions of a Lorenz 63 dynamical system, and the control of the drag of a cylinder flow. The method is shown to perform well.",0
"In recent years, there has been increased interest in using machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of feedback control systems in fluids applications. One particularly promising approach is the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) as the basis for feedback controllers. These DNN controllers can learn from data obtained through experimental testing, offering significant potential advantages over traditional model-based controller designs, which require detailed knowledge of the underlying physics of the system being controlled. This work presents a new strategy for training DNN-based controllers that is specifically tailored to fluid flow problems. Our method makes use of techniques such as data augmentation, which increases the size and diversity of the training dataset, leading to better generalization capabilities of the resulting controller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy by applying it to several examples drawn from both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fluid flow problems, including vortex shedding suppression behind a bluff body and jet noise attenuation control. Overall, we show that our method leads to improved controller performance compared to existing approaches based on standard backpropagation and empirical risk minimization techniques. By leveraging recent advances in machine learning theory and practice, we believe that our method represents an important step towards realizing the full potential of DNN-based control strategies in fluids applications, with potentially transformative impact across many fields where these challenging control tasks are encountered. In summary: Using neural network controllers to regulate complex fluids seems promising, but present methods have limitations. We detail a more effective framework inspired by modern deep learning, demonstrating superior results on multiple example problems involving things like suppressing disturbances and reducing noisiness in jets. Hopefully our ideas may prove broadly beneficial throughout science and engineering; here's why we think so and how our research builds upon prior efforts.

"In recent years there have been many successes of using deep representations in reinforcement learning. Still, many of these applications use conventional architectures, such as convolutional networks, LSTMs, or auto-encoders. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture for model-free reinforcement learning. Our dueling network represents two separate estimators: one for the state value function and one for the state-dependent action advantage function. The main benefit of this factoring is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this architecture leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions. Moreover, the dueling architecture enables our RL agent to outperform the state-of-the-art on the Atari 2600 domain.",0
"This research compares two different deep reinforcement learning network architectures: a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and a hybrid architecture that combines CNNs with recurrent layers. Both types of networks were used to solve a range of continuous control tasks using several algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Proximal Twin Delayed Dependence on Experience (TD3). These results showed that both network architectures provided similar levels of performance across all tested environments, suggesting that either type can be used depending on user preferences and resource availability. However, the hybrid network outperformed the purely convolutional one in some cases due to the ability of recurrent layers to maintain historical context. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of different network architectures for deep RL and provide insights into which architectures may perform better under specific circumstances.",1
"In this paper we present a new way of predicting the performance of a reinforcement learning policy given historical data that may have been generated by a different policy. The ability to evaluate a policy from historical data is important for applications where the deployment of a bad policy can be dangerous or costly. We show empirically that our algorithm produces estimates that often have orders of magnitude lower mean squared error than existing methods---it makes more efficient use of the available data. Our new estimator is based on two advances: an extension of the doubly robust estimator (Jiang and Li, 2015), and a new way to mix between model based estimates and importance sampling based estimates.",0
"Title: An Introduction To Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) This article provides an overview of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which refers to a hypothetical future stage of artificial intelligence that would operate at human level across multiple domains of understanding, cognitive tasks, knowledge and expertise. AGI would have cognitive capabilities such as perception, reasoning, learning, communication, adaptability, self reflection, creativity, imagination, common sense reasoning and planning. AGI research focuses on creating machines capable of performing intellectual functions of humans, by simulating natural ways of thinking. Current AGI models include deep neural networks and reinforcement learning agents. However, achieving AGI is still considered as one of the most challenging problems facing AI today due to our limited understanding of how the brain processes information. There are many open questions related to the nature of general intelligence and consciousness, and even if we could simulate them via algorithms or hardware, there are ethical implications related to granting autonomy and potentially surpassing biological limits. Still, the quest continues because of potential applications and benefits to society such as solving complex real world problems including healthcare, education and space exploration.",1
"Off-policy reinforcement learning has many applications including: learning from demonstration, learning multiple goal seeking policies in parallel, and representing predictive knowledge. Recently there has been an proliferation of new policy-evaluation algorithms that fill a longstanding algorithmic void in reinforcement learning: combining robustness to off-policy sampling, function approximation, linear complexity, and temporal difference (TD) updates. This paper contains two main contributions. First, we derive two new hybrid TD policy-evaluation algorithms, which fill a gap in this collection of algorithms. Second, we perform an empirical comparison to elicit which of these new linear TD methods should be preferred in different situations, and make concrete suggestions about practical use.",0
"Learning is essential for many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, from computer vision to natural language understanding. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful method for training AI systems on complex problems. However, even these highly capable models can struggle with sequential decision making problems, where selecting the correct action at each step depends critically on both short-term rewards and long-term consequences. One popular approach for addressing these challenges is called ""Temporal Difference (TD)"" learning. TD algorithms use trial-and-error updates based on the difference between expected and actual returns to update estimates of value functions, which describe how good it is to be in a particular state. Unfortunately, naive applications of TD learning often suffer from instability, oscillations, and other issues that limit their effectiveness. Recent work has focused on developing more stable forms of TD learning such as Sarsa and Q-Learning. These methods have proved effective but still rely on assumptions that may not hold true in practice, such as the ability to observe all relevant states or to obtain accurate reward signals. This study investigates alternative approaches to Temporal Difference (TD) learning known as ""Linear"" or ""Smoothed Bellman Residue"" methods, which relax some of the standard assumptions while preserving convergence guarantees under certain conditions. Our experiments show that Linear TD achieves better stability and performance than traditional nonlinear TD methods across several benchmark domains. We hope our findings will contribute to the development of more robust, reliable solutions for real-world sequential decision making problems.",1
"We describe and study a model for an Automated Online Recommendation System (AORS) in which a user's preferences can be time-dependent and can also depend on the history of past recommendations and play-outs. The three key features of the model that makes it more realistic compared to existing models for recommendation systems are (1) user preference is inherently latent, (2) current recommendations can affect future preferences, and (3) it allows for the development of learning algorithms with provable performance guarantees. The problem is cast as an average-cost restless multi-armed bandit for a given user, with an independent partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for each item of content. We analyze the POMDP for a single arm, describe its structural properties, and characterize its optimal policy. We then develop a Thompson sampling-based online reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters of the model and optimize utility from the binary responses of the users to continuous recommendations. We then analyze the performance of the learning algorithm and characterize the regret. Illustrative numerical results and directions for extension to the restless hidden Markov multi-armed bandit problem are also presented.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm for finding optimal policies in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with reactive agents. We show how online learning techniques can be used to iteratively refine an initial policy based on the reactions of the users over time. Our approach has two key features: firstly, it minimizes regret by using action-sampling methods to balance exploration and exploitation; secondly, it adaptively adjusts the parameters of the model as more data becomes available. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing algorithms for POMDPs with reactivity. We conclude that our proposed method offers significant improvements in performance and robustness for many real-world applications where user interactions are uncertain and dynamic. Overall, this work provides important insights into efficient ways of optimizing recommendations for complex systems involving human behavior.",1
"Clearly explaining a rationale for a classification decision to an end-user can be as important as the decision itself. Existing approaches for deep visual recognition are generally opaque and do not output any justification text; contemporary vision-language models can describe image content but fail to take into account class-discriminative image aspects which justify visual predictions. We propose a new model that focuses on the discriminating properties of the visible object, jointly predicts a class label, and explains why the predicted label is appropriate for the image. We propose a novel loss function based on sampling and reinforcement learning that learns to generate sentences that realize a global sentence property, such as class specificity. Our results on a fine-grained bird species classification dataset show that our model is able to generate explanations which are not only consistent with an image but also more discriminative than descriptions produced by existing captioning methods.",0
"Title: ""Generating Visual Explanations""  Abstract: Understanding complex ideas and data can often be challenging without proper visualization techniques that can effectively communicate information. In order to overcome these limitations, researchers have explored different approaches to generate explanatory visualizations that provide insights into patterns, relationships, and trends within the data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing methods used to create visual explanations, covering both qualitative and quantitative approaches. We discuss how these techniques are applied across domains, including scientific discovery, decision support systems, and public communication. Moreover, we analyze current limitations and future directions, highlighting key areas for improvement and potential applications of generative visual explanation methods. Our review provides valuable insights for practitioners and researchers interested in developing effective tools for creating visually informative representations of complex data sets. Overall, our aim is to contribute to advancing the state-of-the-art in generating dynamic, interactive visual explanations that reveal hidden structures and meaning behind large datasets.",1
"Datasets with hundreds to tens of thousands features is the new norm. Feature selection constitutes a central problem in machine learning, where the aim is to derive a representative set of features from which to construct a classification (or prediction) model for a specific task. Our experimental study involves microarray gene expression datasets, these are high-dimensional and noisy datasets that contain genetic data typically used for distinguishing between benign or malicious tissues or classifying different types of cancer. In this paper, we formulate feature selection as a multiagent coordination problem and propose a novel feature selection method using multiagent reinforcement learning. The central idea of the proposed approach is to ""assign"" a reinforcement learning agent to each feature where each agent learns to control a single feature, we refer to this approach as MARL. Applying this to microarray datasets creates an enormous multiagent coordination problem between thousands of learning agents. To address the scalability challenge we apply a form of reward shaping called CLEAN rewards. We compare in total nine feature selection methods, including state-of-the-art methods, and show that the proposed method using CLEAN rewards can significantly scale-up, thus outperforming the rest of learning-based methods. We further show that a hybrid variant of MARL achieves the best overall performance.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to feature selection based on multiagent coordination. We model feature selection as a game among multiple agents who have conflicting preferences over which features should be selected. Each agent represents a different type of domain knowledge or expertise that can inform the feature selection process. We then use a coordinated solution concept from the field of microeconomics called a correlated equilibrium (CE) to find a set of features that simultaneously satisfies all the agents’ preferred feature subsets. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art feature selection techniques across a range of classification tasks and datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our framework allows us to incorporate prior beliefs and domain-specific constraints into the feature selection process in a principled manner. Overall, our work advances the state-of-the-art in feature selection by casting it as a distributed decision making problem among multiple parties with heterogeneous objectives and preferences.",1
"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the most widely used techniques for online optimization in machine learning. In this work, we accelerate SGD by adaptively learning how to sample the most useful training examples at each time step. First, we show that SGD can be used to learn the best possible sampling distribution of an importance sampling estimator. Second, we show that the sampling distribution of an SGD algorithm can be estimated online by incrementally minimizing the variance of the gradient. The resulting algorithm - called Adaptive Weighted SGD (AW-SGD) - maintains a set of parameters to optimize, as well as a set of parameters to sample learning examples. We show that AWSGD yields faster convergence in three different applications: (i) image classification with deep features, where the sampling of images depends on their labels, (ii) matrix factorization, where rows and columns are not sampled uniformly, and (iii) reinforcement learning, where the optimized and exploration policies are estimated at the same time, where our approach corresponds to an off-policy gradient algorithm.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to online learning that leverages techniques from sampling theory to enable efficient training even when only small batches of data become available over time. By incorporating recent advances in adaptive sampling methods and mini-batch gradient descent algorithms into a single framework, we can significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional offline solutions. Our proposed method enables real-time decision making by quickly updating models as new data becomes available, which makes it well suited for applications where timeliness is crucial, such as recommendation systems or anomaly detection in cybersecurity. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic benchmarks and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across several machine learning tasks, including regression, classification, and unsupervised clustering. Overall, this work represents an important step forward towards enabling efficient online learning under limited data availability.",1
"In this paper, we present a robotic model-based reinforcement learning method that combines ideas from model identification and model predictive control. We use a feature-based representation of the dynamics that allows the dynamics model to be fitted with a simple least squares procedure, and the features are identified from a high-level specification of the robot's morphology, consisting of the number and connectivity structure of its links. Model predictive control is then used to choose the actions under an optimistic model of the dynamics, which produces an efficient and goal-directed exploration strategy. We present real time experimental results on standard benchmark problems involving the pendulum, cartpole, and double pendulum systems. Experiments indicate that our method is able to learn a range of benchmark tasks substantially faster than the previous best methods. To evaluate our approach on a realistic robotic control task, we also demonstrate real time control of a simulated 7 degree of freedom arm.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) that combines parametrized physical models with optimism-driven exploration methods. We introduce a method called MOReL, which stands for model-optimism RL, that uses learned dynamics models and value function approximators to bias exploration towards regions where the current policy may fail. Our approach combines recent advances in physics-based modeling and machine learning techniques within an online planning framework that allows us to explore efficiently while maintaining safety guarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating MOReL on challenging continuous control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and compare it against state-of-the art model-free RL algorithms as well as model-based baselines. Our results show that MOReL outperforms these algorithms in most cases while requiring fewer samples to converge. Overall, our work suggests that combining learned models with optimism-driven exploration can lead to more efficient and effective solutions for complex decision making problems under uncertainty.",1
"This paper presents a general framework for exploiting the representational capacity of neural networks to approximate complex, nonlinear reward functions in the context of solving the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem. We show in this context that the Maximum Entropy paradigm for IRL lends itself naturally to the efficient training of deep architectures. At test time, the approach leads to a computational complexity independent of the number of demonstrations, which makes it especially well-suited for applications in life-long learning scenarios. Our approach achieves performance commensurate to the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks while exceeding on an alternative benchmark based on highly varying reward structures. Finally, we extend the basic architecture - which is equivalent to a simplified subclass of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with width one - to include larger convolutions in order to eliminate dependency on precomputed spatial features and work on raw input representations.",0
"Title: A Unified Approach to Inverse RL Based on Maximum Entropy Probabilistic Modeling  Abstract: Solving tasks using deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often requires extensive interaction with the environment, resulting in high computational costs and slow convergence rates. As such, there has been increasing interest in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which involves inferring human preferences from demonstrations rather than explicit guidance. However, existing IRL methods face significant challenges in identifying appropriate reward functions that accurately capture human behavior across diverse domains. This paper presents a novel approach based on maximum entropy probabilistic modeling, capable of capturing complex relationships and effectively generalizing across tasks. Our method unifies several previous approaches under one framework by leveraging state visitation distributions, providing improved performance over alternative models. We evaluate our algorithm across multiple benchmark datasets and showcase its ability to achieve competitive results while maintaining a more straightforward implementation. Overall, our work highlights the potential of combining maximum entropy and deep RL techniques for more efficient and accurate task inference.",1

"Title: Protecting Privacy While Improving Policies: Differential Privacy Techniques in Policy Evaluation  The evaluation of public policies plays a crucial role in ensuring that government initiatives effectively address societal issues while balancing economic and social considerations. However, policy evaluators often face the challenge of handling sensitive data and preventing privacy breaches during analysis. In recent years, differential privacy has emerged as a promising approach to achieving both policy improvement and privacy protection simultaneously. This work discusses the application of differential privacy techniques in policy evaluation, focusing on their benefits and limitations.  Differential privacy provides provable guarantees on individual privacy by introducing random noise into statistical analyses, without significantly affecting the accuracy of results. Applying these principles can help policymakers make informed decisions based on evidence without compromising confidentiality. This article explores several use cases where differential privacy adds value to policy evaluation: (1) measuring program effectiveness under limited participation rates; (2) examining treatment effects from observational studies subject to confounding biases; and (3) investigating disparities across demographic groups without disclosing potentially harmful statistics.  While differentially private policy evaluation offers significant advantages over traditional methods, certain challenges persist. One major difficulty lies in striking an appropriate balance between privacy protection and accurate policy analysis, which may result in suboptimal solutions if either aspect receives insufficient attention. Additionally, practitioners must carefully select parameters such as privacy budgets and noise distributions to achieve satisfactory levels of protection while minimizing loss in precision.  In conclusion, this study emphasizes the potential of differential privacy in improving public policies while safeguarding personal informa",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a range of challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm, which we call normalized adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks. To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are applicable.",0
"Title: ""Continuous Deep Q-Learning with Model-Based Acceleration""  Abstract: This research presents a new approach to deep reinforcement learning that combines continuous action spaces with model-based acceleration techniques. The proposed method uses an actor-critic architecture with a centralized critic and decentralized actors, which allows for more efficient exploration and faster convergence than traditional methods. The model-based component utilizes a neural network approximation of the transition dynamics, allowing for fast updates without requiring full batch gradient descent. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark problems demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and stability. These results suggest that the proposed approach has strong potential for applications in real-world decision making under uncertainty, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and financial trading.",1
"Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for automated acquisition of robotic motion skills. However, applying reinforcement learning requires a sufficiently detailed representation of the state, including the configuration of task-relevant objects. We present an approach that automates state-space construction by learning a state representation directly from camera images. Our method uses a deep spatial autoencoder to acquire a set of feature points that describe the environment for the current task, such as the positions of objects, and then learns a motion skill with these feature points using an efficient reinforcement learning method based on local linear models. The resulting controller reacts continuously to the learned feature points, allowing the robot to dynamically manipulate objects in the world with closed-loop control. We demonstrate our method with a PR2 robot on tasks that include pushing a free-standing toy block, picking up a bag of rice using a spatula, and hanging a loop of rope on a hook at various positions. In each task, our method automatically learns to track task-relevant objects and manipulate their configuration with the robot's arm.",0
"Here we introduce deep spatial autoencoders (DSAs), which constitute generative neural models that are capable of representing high-dimensional sensory data by learning low-dimensional latent variables in a data-driven manner. By optimizing reconstruction loss only using backpropagation through the encoder network during training, DSAs allow for efficient generation as well as exact storage of complex multimodal datasets at arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate how these models can faithfully capture visually veridical representations on large benchmark datasets such as dSprites and the CelebA dataset. Moreover, these same models possess clear utility for accelerating a broad range of difficult deep reinforcement learning tasks, including those without any explicit feedback signals, even outperforming model-free proximal policy optimization methods like TRPO in some cases. Finally, by utilizing learned dynamics priors, the resulting visuomotor control policies closely match human-level performance while operating on raw visual inputs alone. These results highlight the potential for integrating powerful latent variable models into generalizable agents that learn diverse behaviors across multiple domains without requiring taskspecific modifications. As such, our findings lay the groundwork for future research that seeks to achieve robust artificial intelligence from scratch.",1
"A key problem in reinforcement learning for control with general function approximators (such as deep neural networks and other nonlinear functions) is that, for many algorithms employed in practice, updates to the policy or $Q$-function may fail to improve performance---or worse, actually cause the policy performance to degrade. Prior work has addressed this for policy iteration by deriving tight policy improvement bounds; by optimizing the lower bound on policy improvement, a better policy is guaranteed. However, existing approaches suffer from bounds that are hard to optimize in practice because they include sup norm terms which cannot be efficiently estimated or differentiated. In this work, we derive a better policy improvement bound where the sup norm of the policy divergence has been replaced with an average divergence; this leads to an algorithm, Easy Monotonic Policy Iteration, that generates sequences of policies with guaranteed non-decreasing returns and is easy to implement in a sample-based framework.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence and decision making under uncertainty, policy iteration is a widely used algorithm that searches for an optimal policy by iteratively improving upon it until convergence. However, existing methods face challenges such as non-monotonicity and local optima, which can lead to suboptimal solutions or slow convergence. This paper proposes Easy Monotonic Policy Iteration (EMPI), an improved policy iteration method designed to overcome these issues while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. EMPI ensures monotonic improvement at each iteration through a novel objective function and constraint handling mechanism, resulting in faster and more reliable convergence to globally optimal policies. Empirical evaluations on various problem domains demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of EMPI compared to state-of-the-art policy iteration algorithms. Our contributions provide valuable insights into efficient search for optimal policies and highlight the potential impact on real-world applications.",1
"Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is known to model human decisions well, with substantial empirical evidence supporting this claim. CPT works by distorting probabilities and is more general than the classic expected utility and coherent risk measures. We bring this idea to a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) setting and design algorithms for both estimation and control. The RL setting presents two particular challenges when CPT is applied: estimating the CPT objective requires estimations of the entire distribution of the value function and finding a randomized optimal policy. The estimation scheme that we propose uses the empirical distribution to estimate the CPT-value of a random variable. We then use this scheme in the inner loop of a CPT-value optimization procedure that is based on the well-known simulation optimization idea of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for all the proposed algorithms and also illustrate the usefulness of CPT-based criteria in a traffic signal control application.",0
"Title: From Punishments to Rewards: How Behavioral Economics Can Help Us Build Smarter AIs In recent years, behavioral economics has gained recognition as a field that can shed light on human decision making processes. By understanding how humans make decisions, we can design artificial intelligence systems that interact more effectively with their environment. We explore three applications of cognitive biases from behavioral economics in developing smarter AI agents. Firstly, we showcase how prospect theory can improve reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a more accurate model of agent preferences. Secondly, we demonstrate how framing effects can guide decisions in uncertain environments by altering the presentation of options. Finally, we illustrate how social comparison can drive performance improvements through competitive motivation. By integrating these findings into AI designs, we aim to create agents that operate in ways similar to their human counterparts - intelligent, adaptive, and ever improving.",1
"Experience replay lets online reinforcement learning agents remember and reuse experiences from the past. In prior work, experience transitions were uniformly sampled from a replay memory. However, this approach simply replays transitions at the same frequency that they were originally experienced, regardless of their significance. In this paper we develop a framework for prioritizing experience, so as to replay important transitions more frequently, and therefore learn more efficiently. We use prioritized experience replay in Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm that achieved human-level performance across many Atari games. DQN with prioritized experience replay achieves a new state-of-the-art, outperforming DQN with uniform replay on 41 out of 49 games.",0
"In recent years there has been a growing interest in deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that leverage large amounts of data to achieve human level performance on complex tasks, including games such as chess, Go, and video games like Atari and Doom. One approach that has proven particularly effective is called experience replay. This method involves random sampling from a buffer of past experiences stored during training, which helps stabilize learning and improves performance compared to using only one batch of transitions per epoch. However, simply storing all past experiences uniformly can lead to wasted memory space and slow down learning, especially if each transition contains many state-action pairs. Therefore, prioritizing certain transitions over others based on their value as learning signals would be desirable, but selecting good experience replay priorities remains challenging. This paper presents a new method we call Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), which dynamically selects high priority transitions and efficiently combines them with low priority ones to maximize learning efficiency while minimizing storage overhead. Our key insight is that transitions generated by high quality actions tend to be more informative for guiding policy updates than those resulting from lower quality choices. We formulate PER as a Bayesian optimization problem, solving for optimal weights balancing uniform sampling and action-greedy selection via Thompson Sampling. We empirically evaluate PER against baselines across several Atari game benchmarks, demonstrating clear improvements in both sample complexity and final performance relative to popular existing methods, including prioritized sweeping and KL-controlled mixing techniques. Additionally, we study how our algorithm makes tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation through the use of adaptive temperature scaling. Our results suggest tha",1
"The ability to act in multiple environments and transfer previous knowledge to new situations can be considered a critical aspect of any intelligent agent. Towards this goal, we define a novel method of multitask and transfer learning that enables an autonomous agent to learn how to behave in multiple tasks simultaneously, and then generalize its knowledge to new domains. This method, termed ""Actor-Mimic"", exploits the use of deep reinforcement learning and model compression techniques to train a single policy network that learns how to act in a set of distinct tasks by using the guidance of several expert teachers. We then show that the representations learnt by the deep policy network are capable of generalizing to new tasks with no prior expert guidance, speeding up learning in novel environments. Although our method can in general be applied to a wide range of problems, we use Atari games as a testing environment to demonstrate these methods.",0
"This abstract outlines the methodology behind Actor-Mimic (AM), which utilizes deep multitask reinforcement learning techniques that allow agents to perform multiple tasks concurrently while achieving competitive performance on individual tasks. AM transfers these learned policies to new environments without additional training time, reducing the gap from a cold start compared to traditional RL methods. An actor network estimates future rewards of diverse action sequences based on current state representations produced by either policy learning or transferring across similar source domains. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results using different robotics platforms, demonstrating improved overall reward signal during multitask learning and zero-shot task adoption without specific adaptation phases.",1
"Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective method for controlling robotic systems, particularly autonomous aerial vehicles such as quadcopters. However, application of MPC can be computationally demanding, and typically requires estimating the state of the system, which can be challenging in complex, unstructured environments. Reinforcement learning can in principle forego the need for explicit state estimation and acquire a policy that directly maps sensor readings to actions, but is difficult to apply to unstable systems that are liable to fail catastrophically during training before an effective policy has been found. We propose to combine MPC with reinforcement learning in the framework of guided policy search, where MPC is used to generate data at training time, under full state observations provided by an instrumented training environment. This data is used to train a deep neural network policy, which is allowed to access only the raw observations from the vehicle's onboard sensors. After training, the neural network policy can successfully control the robot without knowledge of the full state, and at a fraction of the computational cost of MPC. We evaluate our method by learning obstacle avoidance policies for a simulated quadrotor, using simulated onboard sensors and no explicit state estimation at test time.",0
"Recently, autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) have gained significant attention due to their potential applications such as package delivery and search and rescue missions. To achieve safe and efficient operation, these systems need control policies that can account for uncertain dynamics and environment interactions. Model predictive control (MPC)-based policy search methods offer a promising approach by optimizing over short-horizon predictions and using iterative learning strategies. In our study, we propose a new method combining deep neural networks with MPC-guided policy search to learn high-performance AAV control policies from raw sensory inputs. Our results show that compared to existing approaches, our algorithm leads to improved performance on standard benchmarking tasks while exhibiting robustness against various disturbances and changes in environmental conditions. This work represents a significant step towards enabling reliable autonomy for real-world AAV operations.",1
"We propose randomized least-squares value iteration (RLSVI) -- a new reinforcement learning algorithm designed to explore and generalize efficiently via linearly parameterized value functions. We explain why versions of least-squares value iteration that use Boltzmann or epsilon-greedy exploration can be highly inefficient, and we present computational results that demonstrate dramatic efficiency gains enjoyed by RLSVI. Further, we establish an upper bound on the expected regret of RLSVI that demonstrates near-optimality in a tabula rasa learning context. More broadly, our results suggest that randomized value functions offer a promising approach to tackling a critical challenge in reinforcement learning: synthesizing efficient exploration and effective generalization.",0
"This paper explores how the behavior of deep reinforcement learning agents can be influenced by randomizing their value functions during training. By introducing randomness into these value functions, we are able to encourage generalization across a wide range of environments while still allowing for targeted exploration within specific tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to better overall performance and more robust agents compared to traditional RL algorithms without value function randomization. We conclude by discussing potential applications of this method beyond simple reward maximization scenarios. The use of randomization as a technique has been well established in many areas of machine learning, but less so in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). One area where there remains room for improvement is in encouraging generalization across multiple environments. In order to address this challenge, we propose using randomly initialized Q-functions during training. This allows us to explore different options at each decision point and to learn from the diverse set of solutions discovered through this process. At the same time, we provide guidance towards promising areas for exploration by defining our own objectives and constraints for the agent to follow. Through a variety of experimental settings, we show that our proposed approach results in improved performance over baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of randomization as a means of achieving both generalization and specialization in complex problems. As such, this work has significant implications for future research on efficient and effective model development and deployment.",1
"We present a data-efficient reinforcement learning algorithm resistant to observation noise. Our method extends the highly data-efficient PILCO algorithm (Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011) into partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) by considering the filtering process during policy evaluation. PILCO conducts policy search, evaluating each policy by first predicting an analytic distribution of possible system trajectories. We additionally predict trajectories w.r.t. a filtering process, achieving significantly higher performance than combining a filter with a policy optimised by the original (unfiltered) framework. Our test setup is the cartpole swing-up task with sensor noise, which involves nonlinear dynamics and requires nonlinear control.",0
"Effective reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically require large amounts of data, which can lead to slow convergence times and may not always achieve optimal results. This paper presents a novel method that improves RL performance by reducing the amount of data required through the use of continuous partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We propose a new algorithm called ""Data-Efficient RL"" that combines model-based and model-free techniques to improve efficiency in both time and sample complexity. Our approach uses model predictive control (MPC), which involves solving constrained optimization problems online at each timestep based on predictions made by the POMDP model. The resulting policy is then used to take actions that maximize cumulative reward over multiple steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark tasks while requiring significantly less data. These findings have important implications for real-world applications where efficient data collection and processing are crucial constraints.",1
"We propose a general framework for sequential and dynamic acquisition of useful information in order to solve a particular task. While our goal could in principle be tackled by general reinforcement learning, our particular setting is constrained enough to allow more efficient algorithms. In this paper, we work under the Learning to Search framework and show how to formulate the goal of finding a dynamic information acquisition policy in that framework. We apply our formulation on two tasks, sentiment analysis and image recognition, and show that the learned policies exhibit good statistical performance. As an emergent byproduct, the learned policies show a tendency to focus on the most prominent parts of each instance and give harder instances more attention without explicitly being trained to do so.",0
"Active Information Acquisition: How People Learn What They Don’t Know By Asking Questions In a world where access to information has become easier than ever before, understanding how we learn new things remains an important question. One key process that people use to acquire new knowledge is active information seeking. This type of learning occurs when individuals take an intentional approach to identifying and filling gaps in their understanding by actively asking questions or seeking out information on their own. Researchers have explored this topic through a variety of disciplines, including psychology, education, computer science, and communication. While there may be some overlap across these fields, each offers unique insights into how and why people engage in active information acquisition. Understanding the factors that influence our willingness and ability to seek out new information can inform interventions aimed at improving lifelong learning and promoting greater curiosity and adaptability in society. Overall, active information seeking represents a critical component of human inquiry that has far-reaching implications for individual development, social relationships, and cultural progress.

"Using deep neural nets as function approximator for reinforcement learning tasks have recently been shown to be very powerful for solving problems approaching real-world complexity. Using these results as a benchmark, we discuss the role that the discount factor may play in the quality of the learning process of a deep Q-network (DQN). When the discount factor progressively increases up to its final value, we empirically show that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of learning steps. When used in conjunction with a varying learning rate, we empirically show that it outperforms original DQN on several experiments. We relate this phenomenon with the instabilities of neural networks when they are used in an approximate Dynamic Programming setting. We also describe the possibility to fall within a local optimum during the learning process, thus connecting our discussion with the exploration/exploitation dilemma.",0
"This sounds like an interesting topic!

In this work, we propose novel dynamic strategies that can effectively discount the impact of deep reinforcement learning policies on overall performance metrics. Our approach builds upon recent advances in adaptive control theory and stochastic approximation methods, and leverages new theoretical insights into the stability properties of policy gradient-based algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive empirical evaluation on several benchmark domains, showing significant improvements over existing approaches in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and generalization ability. Our findings pave the way towards more efficient deployment of DRL models in applications where data may be limited, or computational resources are constrained.",1
"The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is more expressive than all previously considered models because of its external memory. It can be viewed as a broader effort to use abstract external Interfaces and to learn a parametric model that interacts with them.   The capabilities of a model can be extended by providing it with proper Interfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces include memory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as a theorem verifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers of the model. However, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases and search engines, are discrete.   We examine feasibility of learning models to interact with discrete Interfaces. We investigate the following discrete Interfaces: a memory Tape, an input Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train a neural network that interacts with such Interfaces to solve simple algorithmic tasks. Our Interfaces are expressive enough to make our model Turing complete.",0
"Title: ""Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machine Architecture""  Abstract:  Neural Turing machines (NTMs) are a type of neural network architecture that can store and retrieve information from memory during inference. They have shown promise as versatile models capable of solving tasks across several domains such as program induction, question answering, and language translation. However, training NTMs remains challenging due to their high computational cost and instability. In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to optimize these models effectively. This paper presents a revised version of the NTM model designed specifically for RL, termed the reinforcement learning NTM (RL-NTM). We discuss modifications made to the original NTM structure, such as incorporating an external memory buffer and implementing additional reward mechanisms to improve stability during optimization. Our experiments demonstrate improved performance over previous works on benchmark datasets in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we highlight the potential applications of the revised RL-NTM in areas beyond those previously explored by NTMs. Overall, our work showcases the effectiveness of using RL techniques to train NTMs, opening up new possibilities for further advancements in this field.",1
"Deep learning has become the state-of-art tool in many applications, but the evaluation and training of deep models can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. The conditional computation approach has been proposed to tackle this problem (Bengio et al., 2013; Davis & Arel, 2013). It operates by selectively activating only parts of the network at a time. In this paper, we use reinforcement learning as a tool to optimize conditional computation policies. More specifically, we cast the problem of learning activation-dependent policies for dropping out blocks of units as a reinforcement learning problem. We propose a learning scheme motivated by computation speed, capturing the idea of wanting to have parsimonious activations while maintaining prediction accuracy. We apply a policy gradient algorithm for learning policies that optimize this loss function and propose a regularization mechanism that encourages diversification of the dropout policy. We present encouraging empirical results showing that this approach improves the speed of computation without impacting the quality of the approximation.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing neural network architectures that can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and speed.

In this work, we propose several novel techniques for incorporating conditional computation into neural networks, resulting in more efficient and powerful models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on a range of tasks, including image classification, object detection, and language processing. Our results show that conditional computation can lead to substantial improvements in both runtime and accuracy compared to traditional unconditional approaches.

"Policies for complex visual tasks have been successfully learned with deep reinforcement learning, using an approach called deep Q-networks (DQN), but relatively large (task-specific) networks and extensive training are needed to achieve good performance. In this work, we present a novel method called policy distillation that can be used to extract the policy of a reinforcement learning agent and train a new network that performs at the expert level while being dramatically smaller and more efficient. Furthermore, the same method can be used to consolidate multiple task-specific policies into a single policy. We demonstrate these claims using the Atari domain and show that the multi-task distilled agent outperforms the single-task teachers as well as a jointly-trained DQN agent.",0

In this work, we propose a new approach called policy distillation which extracts human-understandable policies directly from DRL models. Our method involves training a separate model on top of the existing DRL agent, where the output of the model is a compact set of rules that approximate the behavior of the original agent. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark environments and demonstrate that the extracted policies closely match the performance of the original agents while being simpler and more interpretable. Our findings show that policy distillation is a promising direction towards achieving explainability in deep RL systems without sacrificing their effectiveness.",1

"Learn-by-doing has been established as an effective form of education, particularly through digital games which provide interactive environments that stimulate problem-solving skills, creativity and analytical thinking. With the rise of deep learning techniques, there is increasing interest in using video game play data for training agents within simulations due to their large amounts of quality human feedback. However, while these tasks have had significant successes, few efforts focus on the general case where agents learn directly from human players without explicit rewards. We introduce MazeBase (http://mazebase.io), a growing collection of procedurally generated mazes designed to serve as benchmarks for studying single-player reinforcement learning problems which can be solved by human novices. Our goal was to create realistic yet challenging levels with varying properties, solvable paths and subgoals that promote curiosity and exploration in players. In addition, our platform contains tools for manual annotation and tracking of player progress allowing researchers to use existing solutions as initializations for machine agents. As such, we aim at enabling both theoretical analysis and empirical comparisons of different algorithms applied to complex domains. So far, our dataset includes over ten thousand unique maze designs each with preliminary evaluations indicating a range of difficulty, duration, path lengths and branching factors along with several million manually labeled screenshots. Furthermore, our first results show promising performance improvements from fine-tuning domain randomization hyperparameters on human-played trajectories, suggesting further opportunities for improving current approaches when grounded in extensive real-world experience. To summarize, MazeBase offers a rich environment for testing RL methods, especially those relying heavily on expert knowledge, and invites research into more advanced forms of interaction like natural language instructions and multi-objective design tradeoffs",1
"In a variety of problems originating in supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, the loss function is defined by an expectation over a collection of random variables, which might be part of a probabilistic model or the external world. Estimating the gradient of this loss function, using samples, lies at the core of gradient-based learning algorithms for these problems. We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs---directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions---and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function's gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The generic scheme we propose unifies estimators derived in variety of prior work, along with variance-reduction techniques therein. It could assist researchers in developing intricate models involving a combination of stochastic and deterministic operations, enabling, for example, attention, memory, and control actions.",0

We also syntactically characterize the form of the final policy. This characterization can be used to precisely detect the convergence point in a simulation. Our result demonstrates that even simple algorithms can be successful in learning a large class of nontrivial tasks. In addition, our framework is elementary in the sense that we only use basic concepts to formally prove convergence.",0
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to significant improvements in the field of autonomous navigation using deep learning techniques. Navigational reinforcement learning (NRL) is a promising approach that uses trial and error feedback from the environment to learn optimal policies for complex tasks such as navigation. However, existing methods suffer from limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, the problem of cycle detection arises when trajectories are repeated due to deadlock situations caused by unseen obstacles or incorrect predictions. This can lead to suboptimal solutions and slow convergence times.  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called ""Convergence of Cycle Detection"" (COCD), which combines insights from traditional methods with modern machine learning algorithms. COCD utilizes a variant of Rao-Blackwellization to sample more informative experiences and reduce sampling variance during policy improvement. To identify cycles more accurately, we introduce a modified self-loop elimination criterion based on confidence intervals derived from uncertainty estimation through Bayesian neural networks. Our experiments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of speed and quality of solution while maintaining computational tractability and scalability to high-dimensional state spaces.

"Motivated by vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in particular Atari games from the recent benchmark Aracade Learning Environment (ALE), we consider spatio-temporal prediction problems where future (image-)frames are dependent on control variables or actions as well as previous frames. While not composed of natural scenes, frames in Atari games are high-dimensional in size, can involve tens of objects with one or more objects being controlled by the actions directly and many other objects being influenced indirectly, can involve entry and departure of objects, and can involve deep partial observability. We propose and evaluate two deep neural network architectures that consist of encoding, action-conditional transformation, and decoding layers based on convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed architectures are able to generate visually-realistic frames that are also useful for control over approximately 100-step action-conditional futures in some games. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to make and evaluate long-term predictions on high-dimensional video conditioned by control inputs.",0

This paper offers a consolidated presentation of a theory of bounded rationality based on information-theoretic ideas. We provide a conceptual justification for using the free energy functional as the objective function for characterizing bounded-rational decisions. This functional possesses three crucial properties: it controls the size of the solution space; it has Monte Carlo planners that are exact, yet bypass the need for exhaustive search; and it captures model uncertainty arising from lack of evidence or from interacting with other agents having unknown intentions. We discuss the single-step decision-making case, and show how to extend it to sequential decisions using equivalence transformations. This extension yields a very general class of decision problems that encompass classical decision rules (e.g. EXPECTIMAX and MINIMAX) as limit cases, as well as trust- and risk-sensitive planning.",0
"Title: ""Information-Theoretic Bounded Rationality""  Abstract: This paper presents a framework for understanding decision making under uncertainty within bounded rationality constraints. In traditional economic models, individuals are assumed to make fully informed decisions based on complete knowledge of their environment. However, in real world situations, decision makers often face limited information, cognitive limitations, and resource constraints that prevent them from achieving perfect information. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on information theory that allows us to model rational behavior in environments where full information is unavailable or impractical to obtain. By analyzing the tradeoffs between acquiring additional information and taking action given existing knowledge, we can develop a more accurate picture of how individuals make decisions under uncertainty. Our analysis reveals new insights into the nature of bounded rationality, including conditions under which it may outperform optimal decision strategies based on full information. Our results have important applications across fields such as finance, management, and public policy, offering guidance on how decision makers should allocate resources in complex environments to achieve desired outcomes.",1
"Partially observed control problems are a challenging aspect of reinforcement learning. We extend two related, model-free algorithms for continuous control -- deterministic policy gradient and stochastic value gradient -- to solve partially observed domains using recurrent neural networks trained with backpropagation through time.   We demonstrate that this approach, coupled with long-short term memory is able to solve a variety of physical control problems exhibiting an assortment of memory requirements. These include the short-term integration of information from noisy sensors and the identification of system parameters, as well as long-term memory problems that require preserving information over many time steps. We also demonstrate success on a combined exploration and memory problem in the form of a simplified version of the well-known Morris water maze task. Finally, we show that our approach can deal with high-dimensional observations by learning directly from pixels.   We find that recurrent deterministic and stochastic policies are able to learn similarly good solutions to these tasks, including the water maze where the agent must learn effective search strategies.",0
"This will be used as an extended abstract for submission to a conference proceedings. What I want: You should explain the concept of memory-based control (MBC) very briefly, mention how traditional methods have limitations in achieving MBC such as vanishing/exploding gradients problem, then describe our proposed method and highlight important results that demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally conclude by reiterating the potential impacts of successful implementation of MBC using RNNs.  Memory-based control is a powerful tool for managing complex systems like robots and intelligent agents. Traditional methods based on feedforward models have limited capacity for storing and recalling past experiences, leading to problems like vanishing and exploding gradients. Our work addresses these limitations through the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which enable more flexible management of internal state and allow for more effective MBC. In particular, we propose a novel approach that combines RNNs with imitation learning from human demonstrations, resulting in significant improvements over previous algorithms. We evaluate our method through extensive simulation experiments across a range of challenging tasks, showing that it can outperform existing techniques and achieve better overall performance. These promising results suggest that RNN-based MBC has strong potential for real-world applications in robotics and artificial intelligence. By enabling more robust and adaptive behavior in autonomous systems, our work could pave the way for new solutions to difficult problems in areas ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. With further development and refinement, memory-based control may become an indispensable component of tomorrow's advanced technologies.",1
"The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.",0
"In the world of deep learning, few topics have gained as much attention recently as reinforcement learning (RL). RL involves training agents to make decisions in complex environments by receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. Recent advances in deep learning have allowed researchers to develop powerful RL algorithms that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. One such algorithm is double Q-learning, which combines two separate Q-value networks to improve stability and reduce overestimation bias. This paper presents a detailed analysis of double Q-learning and demonstrates its effectiveness on several benchmark problems, including both discrete action and continuous control settings. Results show that double Q-learning outperforms single Q-learning methods and other state-of-the-art RL algorithms across all tested domains. These findings suggest that double Q-learning represents a significant advance in deep RL and has great potential for real-world applications. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of how neural network architectures and algorithms can be combined to create highly capable artificial intelligence agents. By exploring new ways to train and evaluate these systems, we can accelerate progress towards general-purpose problem solvers that can adapt to novel situations and learn from experience without explicit programming.",1
"A deep learning approach to reinforcement learning led to a general learner able to train on visual input to play a variety of arcade games at the human and superhuman levels. Its creators at the Google DeepMind's team called the approach: Deep Q-Network (DQN). We present an extension of DQN by ""soft"" and ""hard"" attention mechanisms. Tests of the proposed Deep Attention Recurrent Q-Network (DARQN) algorithm on multiple Atari 2600 games show level of performance superior to that of DQN. Moreover, built-in attention mechanisms allow a direct online monitoring of the training process by highlighting the regions of the game screen the agent is focusing on when making decisions.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to deep reinforcement learning that combines attention mechanisms with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Q-learning. We introduce a model called Deep Attention Recurrent Q-Network (DAQN), which uses an encoder RNN to selectively focus on relevant parts of an input sequence and then learns a Q-value function that takes into account both current state and past experiences stored in the RNN memory. By doing so, DAQN can efficiently learn policies for complex tasks that require reasoning over long time horizons or taking into account temporally extended rewards. Our experiments show that DAQN outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmark problems, including classic control tasks as well as more recent domains such as Atari games. Overall, our work provides insights into how different forms of memory and attentional processing interact during decision making in deep reinforcement learning algorithms.",1
"Electric water heaters have the ability to store energy in their water buffer without impacting the comfort of the end user. This feature makes them a prime candidate for residential demand response. However, the stochastic and nonlinear dynamics of electric water heaters, makes it challenging to harness their flexibility. Driven by this challenge, this paper formulates the underlying sequential decision-making problem as a Markov decision process and uses techniques from reinforcement learning. Specifically, we apply an auto-encoder network to find a compact feature representation of the sensor measurements, which helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. A wellknown batch reinforcement learning technique, fitted Q-iteration, is used to find a control policy, given this feature representation. In a simulation-based experiment using an electric water heater with 50 temperature sensors, the proposed method was able to achieve good policies much faster than when using the full state information. In a lab experiment, we apply fitted Q-iteration to an electric water heater with eight temperature sensors. Further reducing the state vector did not improve the results of fitted Q-iteration. The results of the lab experiment, spanning 40 days, indicate that compared to a thermostat controller, the presented approach was able to reduce the total cost of energy consumption of the electric water heater by 15%.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to controlling electric water heaters using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We describe how RL can be used to optimize the temperature settings of water heaters based on user preferences and energy consumption patterns. Our methodology combines both model-based and model-free RL techniques to learn optimal policies that minimize costs while ensuring comfort for users. In addition to theoretical developments, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on real-world water heater systems. Through extensive simulations and field tests, we show that our RL-based controller outperforms traditional thermostatic control methods by reducing energy consumption while maintaining desired temperatures. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and future directions for applying RL to other home appliances and building systems. Overall, our work highlights the promise of RL as a powerful tool for optimizing the performance of complex systems in real-world environments.",1
"Successful applications of reinforcement learning in real-world problems often require dealing with partially observable states. It is in general very challenging to construct and infer hidden states as they often depend on the agent's entire interaction history and may require substantial domain knowledge. In this work, we investigate a deep-learning approach to learning the representation of states in partially observable tasks, with minimal prior knowledge of the domain. In particular, we propose a new family of hybrid models that combines the strength of both supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), trained in a joint fashion: The SL component can be a recurrent neural networks (RNN) or its long short-term memory (LSTM) version, which is equipped with the desired property of being able to capture long-term dependency on history, thus providing an effective way of learning the representation of hidden states. The RL component is a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize the control for maximizing long-term rewards. Extensive experiments in a direct mailing campaign problem demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach, which performs the best among a set of previous state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in using reinforcement learning (RL) as a means of solving complex problems across various domains. However, traditional RL approaches often suffer from the problem of scalability due to their reliance on frequent updates and rollouts. This issue becomes even more challenging when dealing with tasks that involve sequential decision making over extended time horizons. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid approach to RL called recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL). Our method combines deep neural networks with the power of recurrent units to model both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. We demonstrate how our model can effectively learn and solve sequential decision making tasks while offering improved sample efficiency compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to simulated grid world environments, continuous control problems, and real-world benchmarks, obtaining state-of-the-art results. Overall, our work provides evidence of the potential benefits of incorporating memory into RL algorithms, paving the way for further research in this area.",1
"We present an active detection model for localizing objects in scenes. The model is class-specific and allows an agent to focus attention on candidate regions for identifying the correct location of a target object. This agent learns to deform a bounding box using simple transformation actions, with the goal of determining the most specific location of target objects following top-down reasoning. The proposed localization agent is trained using deep reinforcement learning, and evaluated on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. We show that agents guided by the proposed model are able to localize a single instance of an object after analyzing only between 11 and 25 regions in an image, and obtain the best detection results among systems that do not use object proposals for object localization.",0
"Our work presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for active object localization. We address the challenge of finding objects efficiently by jointly optimizing data collection actions (e.g., moving a camera) and model parameters (i.e., updating object detector weights). To achieve these goals, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision making process where our agent interacts with the environment to improve its knowledge about objects. Experiments on public datasets show that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches under both accuracy and efficiency metrics. Overall, our proposed framework can serve as an effective tool for robotic applications where real-time scene understanding is necessary.",1
"This paper introduces a machine learning based system for controlling a robotic manipulator with visual perception only. The capability to autonomously learn robot controllers solely from raw-pixel images and without any prior knowledge of configuration is shown for the first time. We build upon the success of recent deep reinforcement learning and develop a system for learning target reaching with a three-joint robot manipulator using external visual observation. A Deep Q Network (DQN) was demonstrated to perform target reaching after training in simulation. Transferring the network to real hardware and real observation in a naive approach failed, but experiments show that the network works when replacing camera images with synthetic images.",0
"In this paper we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses vision as input instead of traditional sensors like lidar or radar, which are commonly used in robotics today. Our approach combines computer vision techniques with deep learning algorithms to learn motion control policies directly from visual observations. This has several advantages over traditional sensor modalities: firstly, cameras are ubiquitous and can provide rich high-resolution image data at low cost; secondly, our method can adapt quickly to new environments by simply observing them through the camera; thirdly, our algorithm can handle large state spaces, making it applicable to complex tasks such as dexterous manipulation. To validate our approach we demonstrate successful motion control on both simulated robots and real physical robots in challenging environments. We compare our results against state-of-the art methods using alternative sensor modality such as lidar and show improved performance. We believe our work represents an important step towards achieving general purpose autonomous agents that can perform a wide range of motion control task using just vision. --- There are many papers written about developing controllers using RL with cameras as inputs, including those using other algorithms than DDPG/SAC. There are even more that use other types of sensors such as LiDAR and odometry. Can you clarify how your specific contribution advances the state of research?",1
"We propose a distributed deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is based on the deep Q-network, a convolutional neural network trained with a variant of Q-learning. Its input is raw pixels and its output is a value function estimating future rewards from taking an action given a system state. To distribute the deep Q-network training, we adapt the DistBelief software framework to the context of efficiently training reinforcement learning agents. As a result, the method is completely asynchronous and scales well with the number of machines. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to achieve reasonable success on a simple game with minimal parameter tuning.",0
"In distributed deep learning methods, many workers can train parts of a neural network model on local datasets and share their weights through communication rounds so that each worker updates according to the received shared weight differences, as well as its own gradient steps. This approach has been found effective at scaling up training data sizes beyond what a single machine can handle while also achieving reasonable accuracy, but existing work often relies heavily on centralized coordination to manage these communications among multiple nodes. To address these challenges, we propose DDQN, a fully decentralized method that learns both global policies and local credit assignment without any form of central coordination by introducing novel ideas into deep RL: (a) use of personal experience replay buffers at each node to generate diverse experiences; and (b) an asynchronous version of the original synchronous Q-learning update rules, which enables efficient parallel learning across all nodes. We show experimentally on realworld problems that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in terms of sample efficiency. Overall, the proposed algorithms provide us with new insights into how deep reinforcement learning can be adapted to function effectively in large scale distributed settings.",1
"The mutual information is a core statistical quantity that has applications in all areas of machine learning, whether this is in training of density models over multiple data modalities, in maximising the efficiency of noisy transmission channels, or when learning behaviour policies for exploration by artificial agents. Most learning algorithms that involve optimisation of the mutual information rely on the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm --- an enumerative algorithm with exponential complexity that is not suitable for modern machine learning applications. This paper provides a new approach for scalable optimisation of the mutual information by merging techniques from variational inference and deep learning. We develop our approach by focusing on the problem of intrinsically-motivated learning, where the mutual information forms the definition of a well-known internal drive known as empowerment. Using a variational lower bound on the mutual information, combined with convolutional networks for handling visual input streams, we develop a stochastic optimisation algorithm that allows for scalable information maximisation and empowerment-based reasoning directly from pixels to actions.",0
"The paper presents a new method for intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning that maximises the information gained from interactions with the environment. This approach allows agents to learn more efficiently by actively seeking out novel experiences. The proposed algorithm leverages variational inference to approximate the agent's latent state, which enables efficient exploration in high-dimensional spaces. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves sample efficiency compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, resulting in faster convergence to optimal policies. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of how agents can effectively self-motivate their own learning processes.",1
"Empowerment quantifies the influence an agent has on its environment. This is formally achieved by the maximum of the expected KL-divergence between the distribution of the successor state conditioned on a specific action and a distribution where the actions are marginalised out. This is a natural candidate for an intrinsic reward signal in the context of reinforcement learning: the agent will place itself in a situation where its action have maximum stability and maximum influence on the future. The limiting factor so far has been the computational complexity of the method: the only way of calculation has so far been a brute force algorithm, reducing the applicability of the method to environments with a small set discrete states. In this work, we propose to use an efficient approximation for marginalising out the actions in the case of continuous environments. This allows fast evaluation of empowerment, paving the way towards challenging environments such as real world robotics. The method is presented on a pendulum swing up problem.",0
"In today’s world, where technology is rapidly advancing and changing the landscape, empowering individuals has become more important than ever before.

"Partial monitoring is a generic framework for sequential decision-making with incomplete feedback. It encompasses a wide class of problems such as dueling bandits, learning with expect advice, dynamic pricing, dark pools, and label efficient prediction. We study the utility-based dueling bandit problem as an instance of partial monitoring problem and prove that it fits the time-regret partial monitoring hierarchy as an easy - i.e. Theta (sqrt{T})- instance. We survey some partial monitoring algorithms and see how they could be used to solve dueling bandits efficiently. Keywords: Online learning, Dueling Bandits, Partial Monitoring, Partial Feedback, Multiarmed Bandits",0
"This work presents a novel approach to dueling bandits problems using utility functions instead of traditional objective metrics such as regret minimization. We cast the problem as a partial monitoring game where players observe only part of their own payoffs and have imperfect knowledge of other players' actions. Our method uses the Gittins index theorem from multi-armed bandit theory to find optimal strategies that maximize cumulative expected utilities over time. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real datasets. Furthermore, we illustrate how our framework can handle complex preferences and prioritization among different objectives, making it applicable to a wide range of applications. Overall, this research provides new insights into dueling bandits and highlights the potential benefits of using utility functions in decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Transferring knowledge across a sequence of related tasks is an important challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite much encouraging empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical analysis. In this paper, we study a class of lifelong RL problems: the agent solves a sequence of tasks modeled as finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), each of which is from a finite set of MDPs with the same state/action sets and different transition/reward functions. Motivated by the need for cross-task exploration in lifelong learning, we formulate a novel online coupon-collector problem and give an optimal algorithm. This allows us to develop a new lifelong RL algorithm, whose overall sample complexity in a sequence of tasks is much smaller than single-task learning, even if the sequence of tasks is generated by an adversary. Benefits of the algorithm are demonstrated in simulated problems, including a recently introduced human-robot interaction problem.",0
"The problem you describe could be called ""The Coupon Collector Problem."" You can think of each coupon as a unique reward, where some rewards are more common than others, just like real-world coupons. This leads to a distribution that looks a lot like Zipf's Law (where few items have many occurrences, but most items only occur rarely). We can use the Coupon Collector Problem to model situations involving exploration and exploitation tradeoffs, like those faced by lifelong reinforcement learners who need to balance exploring new options against sticking with previously identified good choices. We might even use these models to better understand how the brain uses uncertainty and randomness to guide our behavior! -----  Abstract: Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence, addressing challenges related to lifelong learning remains an open problem. One approach involves formulating problems into variants of the well-known Coupon Collector Problem. These variations provide insights into optimal strategies when both exploiting existing knowledge and actively acquiring new information. In light of recent work applying principles from theoretical computer science to neuroscience, we explore the potential application of such computational approaches to enhance understanding of human decision making processes. Our findings highlight the value of incorporating elements of stochasticity in guiding adaptive behavior and suggest promising future directions for research at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive neuroscience.",1
"Gathering the most information by picking the least amount of data is a common task in experimental design or when exploring an unknown environment in reinforcement learning and robotics. A widely used measure for quantifying the information contained in some distribution of interest is its entropy. Greedily minimizing the expected entropy is therefore a standard method for choosing samples in order to gain strong beliefs about the underlying random variables. We show that this approach is prone to temporally getting stuck in local optima corresponding to wrongly biased beliefs. We suggest instead maximizing the expected cross entropy between old and new belief, which aims at challenging refutable beliefs and thereby avoids these local optima. We show that both criteria are closely related and that their difference can be traced back to the asymmetry of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In illustrative examples as well as simulated and real-world experiments we demonstrate the advantage of cross entropy over simple entropy for practical applications.",0
"This paper examines the use of cross entropy as a measure of uncertainty in iterative information gathering tasks. Uncertainty measures play a critical role in these tasks because they allow agents to quantify their lack of knowledge and guide exploration decisions accordingly. While traditional methods such as entropy have been widely used, we argue that cross entropy provides important advantages due to its ability to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties simultaneously. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating that models using cross entropy consistently outperform those using entropy across a range of data sets and information gathering scenarios. These results suggest that incorporating cross entropy into iterative information gathering systems can lead to significant improvements in performance compared to simpler approaches.",1
"Objective: Anemia is a frequent comorbidity in hemodialysis patients that can be successfully treated by administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). ESAs dosing is currently based on clinical protocols that often do not account for the high inter- and intra-individual variability in the patient's response. As a result, the hemoglobin level of some patients oscillates around the target range, which is associated with multiple risks and side-effects. This work proposes a methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize ESA therapy.   Methods: RL is a data-driven approach for solving sequential decision-making problems that are formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Computing optimal drug administration strategies for chronic diseases is a sequential decision-making problem in which the goal is to find the best sequence of drug doses. MDPs are particularly suitable for modeling these problems due to their ability to capture the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the treatment and the stochastic nature of the underlying process. The RL algorithm employed in the proposed methodology is fitted Q iteration, which stands out for its ability to make an efficient use of data.   Results: The experiments reported here are based on a computational model that describes the effect of ESAs on the hemoglobin level. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with the well-known Q-learning algorithm and with a standard protocol. Simulation results show that the performance of Q-learning is substantially lower than FQI and the protocol.   Conclusion: Although prospective validation is required, promising results demonstrate the potential of RL to become an alternative to current protocols.",0
"In this study, we aimed to optimize anemia treatment in hemodialysis patients using reinforcement learning (RL). Anemia is a common complication in these patients due to the loss of blood during dialysis sessions. Current treatment protocols involve administering erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) to boost red blood cell production. However, overdosing can lead to unwanted side effects while underdosing can result in decreased efficacy. To address this challenge, we developed an RL model that learns from past experiences to make better decisions regarding ESA dosages. Our approach leveraged real-world data collected from a large cohort of hemodialysis patients to create a dataset for training and testing our algorithm. We evaluated performance metrics such as mean time to reach target hematocrit levels, total number of adjustments made, and rate of adverse events. Results showed significant improvement compared to current practices, indicating promising potential for machine learning methods in optimizing patient care. Implications for future research on integrating advanced analytics into clinical decision support systems are discussed. Overall, this work highlights the value of innovative approaches to enhance patient outcomes in healthcare settings.",1
"This paper proposes GProp, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous policies with compatible function approximation. The algorithm is based on two innovations. Firstly, we present a temporal-difference based method for learning the gradient of the value-function. Secondly, we present the deviator-actor-critic (DAC) model, which comprises three neural networks that estimate the value function, its gradient, and determine the actor's policy respectively. We evaluate GProp on two challenging tasks: a contextual bandit problem constructed from nonparametric regression datasets that is designed to probe the ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to accurately estimate gradients; and the octopus arm, a challenging reinforcement learning benchmark. GProp is competitive with fully supervised methods on the bandit task and achieves the best performance to date on the octopus arm.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made significant progress towards solving complex problems across multiple domains. However, training continuous policies remains challenging due to difficulties in optimizing value gradients. We propose Compatible Value Gradients (CVG), which addresses these issues by scaling up deep Q-learning to high dimensional state spaces while ensuring compatibility between policy improvement steps and gradient updates.  Our approach extends compatible function estimation methods from supervised learning to RL environments, enabling CVGs to scale more efficiently than existing alternatives such as actor-critic methods or proximal policy optimization. Moreover, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm based on backpropagation through time that learns CVG targets directly from policy improvement trajectories, allowing efficient end-to-end training of both policy evaluation and improvement.  We evaluate our method using three benchmark control tasks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency over prior work and competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. Our analysis suggests that compatibility plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of learned agents and contributes significantly to their robustness during training. Overall, our results provide strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of Compatible Value Gradients in reinforcement learning of continuous deep policies.",1
"We consider how to learn multi-step predictions efficiently. Conventional algorithms wait until observing actual outcomes before performing the computations to update their predictions. If predictions are made at a high rate or span over a large amount of time, substantial computation can be required to store all relevant observations and to update all predictions when the outcome is finally observed. We show that the exact same predictions can be learned in a much more computationally congenial way, with uniform per-step computation that does not depend on the span of the predictions. We apply this idea to various settings of increasing generality, repeatedly adding desired properties and each time deriving an equivalent span-independent algorithm for the conventional algorithm that satisfies these desiderata. Interestingly, along the way several known algorithmic constructs emerge spontaneously from our derivations, including dutch eligibility traces, temporal difference errors, and averaging. This allows us to link these constructs one-to-one to the corresponding desiderata, unambiguously connecting the `how' to the `why'. Each step, we make sure that the derived algorithm subsumes the previous algorithms, thereby retaining their properties. Ultimately we arrive at a single general temporal-difference algorithm that is applicable to the full setting of reinforcement learning.",0
"This work is focused on improving our ability to make predictions by looking at data that only indirectly informs us about the outcome we want to predict. We often have access to information that can tell us something about some eventuality without directly telling us how likely it is that such an eventuality will come true; learning from this kind of information can lead to better performance than models based solely on direct evidence. Our approach uses deep neural networks, trained using a novel training methodology based on mutual information maximization, to learn representations that encode information independent of the temporal context in which they appear (i.e., ""independently"" of span). Evaluations demonstrate consistent gains over baseline methods across multiple domains, including language modeling, question answering, and anomaly detection. These results highlight the potential for improved prediction by leveraging indirect knowledge sources in conjunction with powerful machine learning techniques.",1
"Statistical spoken dialogue systems have the attractive property of being able to be optimised from data via interactions with real users. However in the reinforcement learning paradigm the dialogue manager (agent) often requires significant time to explore the state-action space to learn to behave in a desirable manner. This is a critical issue when the system is trained on-line with real users where learning costs are expensive. Reward shaping is one promising technique for addressing these concerns. Here we examine three recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches for providing reward shaping information in addition to the primary (task-orientated) environmental feedback. These RNNs are trained on returns from dialogues generated by a simulated user and attempt to diffuse the overall evaluation of the dialogue back down to the turn level to guide the agent towards good behaviour faster. In both simulated and real user scenarios these RNNs are shown to increase policy learning speed. Importantly, they do not require prior knowledge of the user's goal.",0
"In recent years, spoken dialogue systems have become increasingly important due to their ability to provide efficient communication channels between humans and machines. However, designing effective policies for these systems can be challenging, especially given that users may present unexpected inputs and situations. This paper presents a novel approach to address this problem by using reward shaping with recurrent neural networks (RNN) to speed up on-line policy learning in spoken dialogue systems.  The proposed method leverages the advantages of both model-free reinforcement learning algorithms and value iteration methods, allowing faster convergence to optimal solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. The use of RNNs enables the system to maintain contextual knowledge over time and adapt to changing user behaviors, resulting in more accurate predictions and improved overall performance.  Through extensive experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various metrics, including success rate, response accuracy, and task completion times. These results highlight the effectiveness and potential applications of the proposed technique in real-world scenarios, paving the way towards more advanced and robust spoken dialogue systems. Overall, this work offers valuable insights into the development and optimization of artificial intelligence technologies in natural language processing settings.",1
"To train a statistical spoken dialogue system (SDS) it is essential that an accurate method for measuring task success is available. To date training has relied on presenting a task to either simulated or paid users and inferring the dialogue's success by observing whether this presented task was achieved or not. Our aim however is to be able to learn from real users acting under their own volition, in which case it is non-trivial to rate the success as any prior knowledge of the task is simply unavailable. User feedback may be utilised but has been found to be inconsistent. Hence, here we present two neural network models that evaluate a sequence of turn-level features to rate the success of a dialogue. Importantly these models make no use of any prior knowledge of the user's task. The models are trained on dialogues generated by a simulated user and the best model is then used to train a policy on-line which is shown to perform at least as well as a baseline system using prior knowledge of the user's task. We note that the models should also be of interest for evaluating SDS and for monitoring a dialogue in rule-based SDS.",0
"This research paper explores how we can use neural networks to evaluate the success of user interactions in spoken dialogue systems. By using machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning, we can improve our understanding of user preferences and behavior, allowing us to develop more effective dialogue systems that better meet their needs. The authors propose a novel approach that incorporates both explicit feedback provided by users and implicit indicators derived from the conversation itself, including factors like response length and turn taking. Their experimental results demonstrate that this combined approach outperforms traditional methods for evaluating dialogue quality, leading to improved models and ultimately more successful human-machine interaction. Overall, this work highlights the importance of leveraging real user data to drive advancements in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.",1
"Online decision tree learning algorithms typically examine all features of a new data point to update model parameters. We propose a novel alternative, Reinforcement Learning- based Decision Trees (RLDT), that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to actively examine a minimal number of features of a data point to classify it with high accuracy. Furthermore, RLDT optimizes a long term return, providing a better alternative to the traditional myopic greedy approach to growing decision trees. We demonstrate that this approach performs as well as batch learning algorithms and other online decision tree learning algorithms, while making significantly fewer queries about the features of the data points. We also show that RLDT can effectively handle concept drift.",0
"An important aspect of decision tree construction from data samples involves learning how to choose splits optimally for subsequent refinement via pruning so as to minimize mean squared error. We provide an online variant of reinforcement learning that directly addresses such constructive inductive reasoning, which operates on top of any base learner able to produce decisions and confidence values for individual examples. Our method uses an adaptive policy learned by iteratively selecting informative trees at each time step while weighing early mistakes more heavily than later ones; a corresponding upper bound is provided in order to analyze average regret. This approach produces competitive results relative to batch decision tree methods on real and synthetic datasets across numerous metrics even without employing specialized preprocessing steps or postpruning heuristics commonly used within supervised learning literature.",1
"We present the first massively distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning. This architecture uses four main components: parallel actors that generate new behaviour; parallel learners that are trained from stored experience; a distributed neural network to represent the value function or behaviour policy; and a distributed store of experience. We used our architecture to implement the Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN). Our distributed algorithm was applied to 49 games from Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, using identical hyperparameters. Our performance surpassed non-distributed DQN in 41 of the 49 games and also reduced the wall-time required to achieve these results by an order of magnitude on most games.",0
"""The field of deep reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant advances over recent years due to the development of novel techniques that enable RL agents to learn from complex environments and solve tasks with high accuracy.

To address these limitations, researchers have proposed new parallel computing methods based on massively distributed architectures that can scale up RL algorithms to process massive amounts of data concurrently. These approaches promise greater efficiency and speed while providing opportunities for more accurate solutions and improved decision making in real-world applications.""",1
"Emphatic algorithms are temporal-difference learning algorithms that change their effective state distribution by selectively emphasizing and de-emphasizing their updates on different time steps. Recent works by Sutton, Mahmood and White (2015), and Yu (2015) show that by varying the emphasis in a particular way, these algorithms become stable and convergent under off-policy training with linear function approximation. This paper serves as a unified summary of the available results from both works. In addition, we demonstrate the empirical benefits from the flexibility of emphatic algorithms, including state-dependent discounting, state-dependent bootstrapping, and the user-specified allocation of function approximation resources.",0
"Empathic temporal-difference learning (ETL) algorithms attempt to integrate emotional state into model free reinforcement learning methods by allowing the agent's value function to change based on specific situations rather than just maximizing its own reward as would happen naturally under traditional RL approaches. This approach uses deep neural networks that take both the current situation’s features and the current time step as inputs in order to generate an estimate of how good reaching a certain goal state would feel at the moment in terms of both actual rewards received and the overall level of satisfaction experienced by the agent. ETL models can then use these estimates along with standard TD updates to alter their behavior based on the current context and the perceived impact that taking certain actions might have on both themselves and others. By incorporating elements of psychology that govern human decision making such as motivation towards social approval and fear of negative consequences, our method allows agents trained using ETL techniques to better interact with humans in mixed-initiative tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that ETL leads to more efficient and effective learning across multiple environments compared against several benchmark policies including those built without any access to exogenous emotions.",1
"This technical note presents a new approach to carrying out the kind of exploration achieved by Thompson sampling, but without explicitly maintaining or sampling from posterior distributions. The approach is based on a bootstrap technique that uses a combination of observed and artificially generated data. The latter serves to induce a prior distribution which, as we will demonstrate, is critical to effective exploration. We explain how the approach can be applied to multi-armed bandit and reinforcement learning problems and how it relates to Thompson sampling. The approach is particularly well-suited for contexts in which exploration is coupled with deep learning, since in these settings, maintaining or generating samples from a posterior distribution becomes computationally infeasible.",0
"Machine learning has revolutionized modern decision making in many domains such as healthcare, finance and retail. For sequential decision problems where outcomes are partially observable, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been used with success. However these methods often require large amounts of data from expert demonstrations or interaction with the environment which may not always be possible in practice. In this work we propose a novel method that can learn effectively even when there is little to no prior knowledge available. Our algorithm utilizes Thompson sampling together with deep exploration in order to maximize expected cumulative reward without relying on explicit models of the domain. Experiments on several benchmark control tasks show promising results indicating the effectiveness of our approach. We believe that our proposed methodology could potentially open up new possibilities for solving complex real world decision making problems in various fields.",1
"Data-efficient learning in continuous state-action spaces using very high-dimensional observations remains a key challenge in developing fully autonomous systems. In this paper, we consider one instance of this challenge, the pixels to torques problem, where an agent must learn a closed-loop control policy from pixel information only. We introduce a data-efficient, model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that learns such a closed-loop policy directly from pixel information. The key ingredient is a deep dynamical model that uses deep auto-encoders to learn a low-dimensional embedding of images jointly with a predictive model in this low-dimensional feature space. Joint learning ensures that not only static but also dynamic properties of the data are accounted for. This is crucial for long-term predictions, which lie at the core of the adaptive model predictive control strategy that we use for closed-loop control. Compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods for continuous states and actions, our approach learns quickly, scales to high-dimensional state spaces and is an important step toward fully autonomous learning from pixels to torques.",0
"Machine learning has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing tasks by enabling large models that learn from massive amounts of data. In robotics, traditional model-based control methods still dominate but struggle with high-dimensional and uncertain systems like robots interacting with objects they have never seen before. We show that deep reinforcement learning can directly map image observations to torque control signals for complex robotic manipulation tasks. This requires a dynamics model learned alongside an interaction policy. Our method first pretrains the model via unsupervised reconstruction of future images given past ones. During fine-tuning, both the policy and model are jointly optimized end-to-end using real-time physical simulation to update the robot state. We evaluated our approach on four challenging robotic manipulation tasks: two pushing datasets (the YCB dataset and a new dataset we collected) and two grasping and placing benchmarks (DexNet and the Cornell Grasping Dataset). All results showed improvements over existing baselines using handcrafted features or model-free deep RL without dynamics modeling. Despite their short training times (less than one day per task), our policies achieved better performance than most previously published results across all tasks.

"Bayesian optimization has shown to be a fundamental global optimization algorithm in many applications: ranging from automatic machine learning, robotics, reinforcement learning, experimental design, simulations, etc. The most popular and effective Bayesian optimization relies on a surrogate model in the form of a Gaussian process due to its flexibility to represent a prior over function. However, many algorithms and setups relies on the stationarity assumption of the Gaussian process. In this paper, we present a novel nonstationary strategy for Bayesian optimization that is able to outperform the state of the art in Bayesian optimization both in stationary and nonstationary problems.",0
"This abstract presents new research on efficient Bayesian optimization through local nonstationarity. Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique used in machine learning to search over spaces of functions to find optimal parameters that maximize performance metrics such as accuracy or log likelihood. However, traditional methods can become computationally intensive and may fail to capture complex relationships within datasets.  The proposed method addresses these limitations by introducing local nonstationarity into the Bayesian optimization process. By breaking down the space of functions into smaller regions of varying complexity, our approach is able to better model dynamic changes in the underlying function landscape. This allows for more efficient exploration of high-performance solutions while reducing the number of costly evaluations required.  Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques across a range of benchmark problems, including both smooth and noisy functions. Furthermore, we show how our framework can handle challenging tasks, such as hyperparameter tuning in deep neural networks, where other approaches struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance.  In conclusion, our work provides a novel perspective on Bayesian optimization, highlighting the benefits of incorporating local nonstationarity into modern machine learning pipelines. Our contributions pave the way for faster, more effective optimization strategies capable of tackling even the most complex real-world scenarios.",1
"Reinforcement learning algorithms need to deal with the exponential growth of states and actions when exploring optimal control in high-dimensional spaces. This is known as the curse of dimensionality. By projecting the agent's state onto a low-dimensional manifold, we can represent the state space in a smaller and more efficient representation. By using this representation during learning, the agent can converge to a good policy much faster. We test this approach in the Mario Benchmarking Domain. When using dimensionality reduction in Mario, learning converges much faster to a good policy. But, there is a critical convergence-performance trade-off. By projecting onto a low-dimensional manifold, we are ignoring important data. In this paper, we explore this trade-off of convergence and performance. We find that learning in as few as 4 dimensions (instead of 9), we can improve performance past learning in the full dimensional space at a faster convergence rate.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for efficiently representing state spaces using principal component analysis (PCA). Traditional methods for state representation require large amounts of computational resources and can lead to poor generalization performance on new data sets. In contrast, our approach uses PCA to generate compact representations that capture the most relevant features of the underlying state space while reducing the dimensionality of the data set. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our results have important implications for applications such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing where efficient state representation is critical. Overall, we believe that our work represents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and demonstrates the potential of PCA for solving real-world problems.",1
"Lifelong reinforcement learning provides a promising framework for developing versatile agents that can accumulate knowledge over a lifetime of experience and rapidly learn new tasks by building upon prior knowledge. However, current lifelong learning methods exhibit non-vanishing regret as the amount of experience increases and include limitations that can lead to suboptimal or unsafe control policies. To address these issues, we develop a lifelong policy gradient learner that operates in an adversarial set- ting to learn multiple tasks online while enforcing safety constraints on the learned policies. We demonstrate, for the first time, sublinear regret for lifelong policy search, and validate our algorithm on several benchmark dynamical systems and an application to quadrotor control.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in various domains such as robotics, computer games, finance, etc., due to its ability to learn policies that maximize long-term rewards from trial and error. However, training RL agents often requires large amounts of data, computational resources, and time, making them impractical for many applications, especially those where interaction with an environment is costly or hazardous. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various approaches to accelerate RL algorithms, including efficient exploration strategies, transfer learning techniques, model compression methods, and more recently safe policy search procedures. This work introduces a new algorithm called SAFELLS, which stands for Safe Actor-Critic Framework for Efficient Large-Scale ReLU Linear Systems, designed specifically for continuous control problems with large action spaces under constraint sets defined by safety requirements or limited budgets. SAFELLS combines the efficiency of value iteration with constrained linear programming via primal-dual interior point methods, enabling robust convergence to feasible solutions within sublinear regret bounds. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods both in terms of sample complexity and solution quality. These findings pave the way for deploying learned models in real-world environments without compromising safety constraints while minimizing cumulative costs during policy improvement.

"We introduce a new, efficient, principled and backpropagation-compatible algorithm for learning a probability distribution on the weights of a neural network, called Bayes by Backprop. It regularises the weights by minimising a compression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.",0

"In order to speed-up classification models when facing a large number of categories, one usual approach consists in organizing the categories in a particular structure, this structure being then used as a way to speed-up the prediction computation. This is for example the case when using error-correcting codes or even hierarchies of categories. But in the majority of approaches, this structure is chosen \textit{by hand}, or during a preliminary step, and not integrated in the learning process. We propose a new model called Reinforced Decision Tree which simultaneously learns how to organize categories in a tree structure and how to classify any input based on this structure. This approach keeps the advantages of existing techniques (low inference complexity) but allows one to build efficient classifiers in one learning step. The learning algorithm is inspired by reinforcement learning and policy-gradient techniques which allows us to integrate the two steps (building the tree, and learning the classifier) in one single algorithm.",0

We present an attention-based model for recognizing multiple objects in images. The proposed model is a deep recurrent neural network trained with reinforcement learning to attend to the most relevant regions of the input image. We show that the model learns to both localize and recognize multiple objects despite being given only class labels during training. We evaluate the model on the challenging task of transcribing house number sequences from Google Street View images and show that it is both more accurate than the state-of-the-art convolutional networks and uses fewer parameters and less computation.,0
"This paper presents a novel approach to multiple object recognition that utilizes visual attention mechanisms to improve performance and accuracy. Our method is based on recent advances in deep learning and computer vision, which enable us to effectively model complex relationships between objects and their environments. By using visual attention, we can selectively focus on relevant regions of interest while disregarding irrelevant information, leading to improved results compared to traditional methods. We evaluate our system on several challenging benchmark datasets and show consistent improvement across all metrics. Our work has important implications for many real-world applications such as self-driving cars, robotics, and medical imaging, where accurate identification of multiple objects is crucial.

"This paper describes a novel method to solve average-reward semi-Markov decision processes, by reducing them to a minimal sequence of cumulative reward problems. The usual solution methods for this type of problems update the gain (optimal average reward) immediately after observing the result of taking an action. The alternative introduced, optimal nudging, relies instead on setting the gain to some fixed value, which transitorily makes the problem a cumulative-reward task, solving it by any standard reinforcement learning method, and only then updating the gain in a way that minimizes uncertainty in a minmax sense. The rule for optimal gain update is derived by exploiting the geometric features of the w-l space, a simple mapping of the space of policies. The total number of cumulative reward tasks that need to be solved is shown to be small. Some experiments are presented to explore the features of the algorithm and to compare its performance with other approaches.",0
"In this work, we consider the problem of solving average-reward semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs) through optimal nudging. We present a new algorithm that can solve SMDPs by breaking them down into a minimal sequence of cumulative tasks. Our approach involves transforming each action of the original task into a sequence of smaller subtasks, which allows us to optimize their performance individually while minimizing the overall number of actions required. We demonstrate how our method can effectively solve a wide range of complex problems in a variety of domains, including robotics, finance, and healthcare. Furthermore, we showcase the benefits of using our algorithm over traditional methods, such as model checking and value iteration, in terms of computation time, scalability, and solution quality.

"The paper outlines a framework for autonomous control of a CRM (customer relationship management) system. First, it explores how a modified version of the widely accepted Recency-Frequency-Monetary Value system of metrics can be used to define the state space of clients or donors. Second, it describes a procedure to determine the optimal direct marketing action in discrete and continuous action space for the given individual, based on his position in the state space. The procedure involves the use of model-free Q-learning to train a deep neural network that relates a client's position in the state space to rewards associated with possible marketing actions. The estimated value function over the client state space can be interpreted as customer lifetime value, and thus allows for a quick plug-in estimation of CLV for a given client. Experimental results are presented, based on KDD Cup 1998 mailing dataset of donation solicitations.",0
"In this paper we propose using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to approximate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) models and then use that approximation as the basis for deciding which actions to take in order to maximize overall profits from customer interactions. Our approach builds on prior work by proposing new algorithms for estimating both discrete action spaces and continuous action spaces. We demonstrate our model performance through simulations based on real world data. Compared to existing methods such as Q-Learning our simulation results show improved overall profitability. Additionally, we provide extensive analysis comparing different training policies and their impacts on policy quality, time efficiency, and stability. Finally, we explore how incorporating additional features and feedback can further improve the accuracy of our proposed method. Overall, the main contribution of this work is developing a novel technique capable of effectively approximating complex nonlinear functions and optimizing customer interaction management problems.",1
"We consider reinforcement learning in parameterized Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where the parameterization may induce correlation across transition probabilities or rewards. Consequently, observing a particular state transition might yield useful information about other, unobserved, parts of the MDP. We present a version of Thompson sampling for parameterized reinforcement learning problems, and derive a frequentist regret bound for priors over general parameter spaces. The result shows that the number of instants where suboptimal actions are chosen scales logarithmically with time, with high probability. It holds for prior distributions that put significant probability near the true model, without any additional, specific closed-form structure such as conjugate or product-form priors. The constant factor in the logarithmic scaling encodes the information complexity of learning the MDP in terms of the Kullback-Leibler geometry of the parameter space.",0
"Here we study Thompson sampling for learning parameterized Markov decision processes (PMDPs). We assume that rewards are generated by a fixed but unknown probability distribution over reward functions, where each reward function maps states to real numbers based on parameters drawn from another fixed but unknown distribution. Our main contributions are: (i) We develop upper confidence bounds for action values in the PMDP setting under these assumptions; (ii) Using these UCBs along with sample average updates, we propose a novel algorithm called PMDP-UCB which solves for the optimal policy for any set of parameters within an epsilon worst case error guarantee; and (iii) We provide empirical results showing PMDP-UCB outperforms existing algorithms on several continuous control tasks. These results suggest Thompson sampling is effective for solving PMDPs even with limited data availability, as would likely occur in practice given random initialization and lack of knowledge regarding exploration/exploitation tradeoffs. Finally, we discuss limitations of our work including those arising due to unknown distributions, finite sample guarantees, and implications on computational tractability.",1
"Many applications that use empirically estimated functions face a curse of dimensionality, because the integrals over most function classes must be approximated by sampling. This paper introduces a novel regression-algorithm that learns linear factored functions (LFF). This class of functions has structural properties that allow to analytically solve certain integrals and to calculate point-wise products. Applications like belief propagation and reinforcement learning can exploit these properties to break the curse and speed up computation. We derive a regularized greedy optimization scheme, that learns factored basis functions during training. The novel regression algorithm performs competitively to Gaussian processes on benchmark tasks, and the learned LFF functions are with 4-9 factored basis functions on average very compact.",0
"In our recent work, we propose a novel modeling framework that exploits linearity within multiple domains while leveraging nonlinear interactions between them using tensorization techniques.

Hereafter, we provide an expository overview of the proposed methodology to encourage reproducibility and facilitate adoption by practitioners.",1
"In recent years, there has been growing focus on the study of automated recommender systems. Music recommendation systems serve as a prominent domain for such works, both from an academic and a commercial perspective. A fundamental aspect of music perception is that music is experienced in temporal context and in sequence. In this work we present DJ-MC, a novel reinforcement-learning framework for music recommendation that does not recommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on a model of preferences for both songs and song transitions. The model is learned online and is uniquely adapted for each listener. To reduce exploration time, DJ-MC exploits user feedback to initialize a model, which it subsequently updates by reinforcement. We evaluate our framework with human participants using both real song and playlist data. Our results indicate that DJ-MC's ability to recommend sequences of songs provides a significant improvement over more straightforward approaches, which do not take transitions into account.",0
"This abstract describes research into using reinforcement learning techniques to create better music playlist recommendations systems for users. This work involves training agents on large datasets of listening histories from real users, so as to learn how different sequences of songs can affect user satisfaction. By measuring user feedback both directly (e.g., explicit ratings) and indirectly (e.g., whether they continue to listen), these models can generate high-quality personalized playlists that adapt over time. Furthermore, this study shows the promise of more advanced RL algorithms like deep Q-learning, which outperform simpler model-free approaches like Q-learning and SARSA while taking less computation time per iteration step. Finally, we provide qualitative analysis comparing our approach to other state-of-the-art recommendation engines based on content filters, latent factor models, and hybrid methods. We conclude by discussing future directions for incorporating richer domain knowledge, such as acoustic features and social signals, into the recommendation process.

"Understanding the affective, cognitive and behavioural processes involved in risk taking is essential for treatment and for setting environmental conditions to limit damage. Using Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning (TDRL) we computationally investigated the effect of optimism in risk perception in a variety of goal-oriented tasks. Optimism in risk perception was studied by varying the calculation of the Temporal Difference error, i.e., delta, in three ways: realistic (stochastically correct), optimistic (assuming action control), and overly optimistic (assuming outcome control). We show that for the gambling task individuals with 'healthy' perception of control, i.e., action optimism, do not develop gambling behaviour while individuals with 'unhealthy' perception of control, i.e., outcome optimism, do. We show that high intensity of sensations and low levels of fear co-occur due to optimistic risk perception. We found that overly optimistic risk perception (outcome optimism) results in risk taking and in persistent gambling behaviour in addition to high intensity of sensations. We discuss how our results replicate risk-taking related phenomena.",0
"This study investigates how optimism influences risk perception by examining the temporal difference (TD) error in relation to sensation seeking, gambling, and fearlessness tendencies. We tested whether TD learning mechanisms were implicated in differences in risk propensity across these traits. Our results suggest that individual variability in neural signatures of reward prediction errors might be responsible for variability in risk taking behaviors. Additionally, we found evidence indicating that increased activity in prefrontal cortex during uncertainty processing may represent greater perceived control over uncertain outcomes which predicts sensation seeking and less risk aversion in individuals with higher levels of positive urgency, a personality trait associated with engaging in risky behavior to feel good. Overall, our findings shed light on neural processes contributing to both adaptive and maladaptive forms of risk taking and support the notion that variation in risk perception arises from differences in how humans process rewards and uncertainties rather than just variations in value alone.",1
"In reinforcement learning, the TD($\lambda$) algorithm is a fundamental policy evaluation method with an efficient online implementation that is suitable for large-scale problems. One practical drawback of TD($\lambda$) is its sensitivity to the choice of the step-size. It is an empirically well-known fact that a large step-size leads to fast convergence, at the cost of higher variance and risk of instability. In this work, we introduce the implicit TD($\lambda$) algorithm which has the same function and computational cost as TD($\lambda$), but is significantly more stable. We provide a theoretical explanation of this stability and an empirical evaluation of implicit TD($\lambda$) on typical benchmark tasks. Our results show that implicit TD($\lambda$) outperforms standard TD($\lambda$) and a state-of-the-art method that automatically tunes the step-size, and thus shows promise for wide applicability.",0
"This paper examines how different types of time manipulation techniques impact people’s perceptions of objects over time. We present two experiments that manipulate temporal differences using either implicit or explicit means. In the first experiment, we investigate whether changing the timing of events affects participants’ judgments of object size and distance. Participants were presented with a virtual environment containing static objects positioned at fixed distances from one another. These objects could appear closer together or further apart due to changes in lighting conditions (e.g., shadows). Our results showed no significant difference between temporally shifted and non-shifted groups on perceived distance, but there was a trend towards smaller object sizes among those whose temporal perspectives had been altered. Additionally, we tested how these effects varied as a function of attention to timing. Results indicated that shifts in spatial perception only occurred under unattended conditions, suggesting that attentional processes may play an important role in modulating perceptual responses to temporal changes. Overall, our findings suggest that subtle changes in temporal perspective can influence low level perception, which has implications for future research exploring visual cognition across multiple domains.",1
"Methods of deep machine learning enable to to reuse low-level representations efficiently for generating more abstract high-level representations. Originally, deep learning has been applied passively (e.g., for classification purposes). Recently, it has been extended to estimate the value of actions for autonomous agents within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Explicit models of the environment can be learned to augment such a value function. Although ""flat"" connectionist methods have already been used for model-based RL, up to now, only model-free variants of RL have been equipped with methods from deep learning. We propose a variant of deep model-based RL that enables an agent to learn arbitrarily abstract hierarchical representations of its environment. In this paper, we present research on how such hierarchical representations can be grounded in sensorimotor interaction between an agent and its environment.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can transfer knowledge learned from one task to another. One approach to achieve this goal is through hierarchical reinforcement learning models (HRLMs), which organize actions into a hierarchy based on their complexity and use subgoals to accomplish more complex tasks. However, grounding HRLMs remains a challenge as these models often operate at a high level of abstraction and lack direct links to real-world sensory input. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a methodology for grounding HRLMs using deep neural networks (DNNs). We demonstrate how DNNs can be used to map high-level representations of states and goals generated by the HRLM onto raw sensor data from simulated environments, enabling the agent to interact with the environment in a meaningful way. Our experiments show that our proposed method leads to improved performance compared to existing methods of knowledge transfer across tasks. Overall, this work represents a step towards building AI agents that can adapt to new situations by leveraging previously acquired knowledge effectively.",1
"State-of-the-art visual recognition and detection systems increasingly rely on large amounts of training data and complex classifiers. Therefore it becomes increasingly expensive both to manually annotate datasets and to keep running times at levels acceptable for practical applications. In this paper, we propose two solutions to address these issues. First, we introduce a weakly supervised, segmentation-based approach to learn accurate detectors and image classifiers from weak supervisory signals that provide only approximate constraints on target localization. We illustrate our system on the problem of action detection in static images (Pascal VOC Actions 2012), using human visual search patterns as our training signal. Second, inspired from the saccade-and-fixate operating principle of the human visual system, we use reinforcement learning techniques to train efficient search models for detection. Our sequential method is weakly supervised and general (it does not require eye movements), finds optimal search strategies for any given detection confidence function and achieves performance similar to exhaustive sliding window search at a fraction of its computational cost.",0
"In this work, we present a new approach for efficient weakly-supervised detection using multiple instance learning (MIL) techniques combined with deep reinforcement learning. Our method utilizes the inherent uncertainty in MIL formulations to enhance the robustness of models trained on weak annotations. Furthermore, our model leverages self-play optimization and policy gradients to enable efficient exploration of large spaces of possible detector parameters. Through experiments on challenging image datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results while significantly reducing annotation costs.",1
"Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is a prominent risk measure that is being used extensively in various domains. We develop a new formula for the gradient of the CVaR in the form of a conditional expectation. Based on this formula, we propose a novel sampling-based estimator for the CVaR gradient, in the spirit of the likelihood-ratio method. We analyze the bias of the estimator, and prove the convergence of a corresponding stochastic gradient descent algorithm to a local CVaR optimum. Our method allows to consider CVaR optimization in new domains. As an example, we consider a reinforcement learning application, and learn a risk-sensitive controller for the game of Tetris.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using optimal portfolio selection methods that take into account risk measures beyond traditional variance-based metrics such as value at risk (VaR). One such measure is conditional value at risk (CVaR), which provides a more complete picture of downside risk by evaluating potential losses given tail events. However, accurately estimating CVaR can be challenging due to the high computational costs associated with solving optimization problems over large datasets. This study proposes a sampling methodology that leverages modern machine learning techniques to optimize the estimation process while reducing computation time and complexity. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches. By improving our understanding of how to effectively estimate CVaR using optimization methods, we can better inform investment decisions that balance return expectations against risk considerations.",1
"We consider the problem of learning to optimize an unknown Markov decision process (MDP). We show that, if the MDP can be parameterized within some known function class, we can obtain regret bounds that scale with the dimensionality, rather than cardinality, of the system. We characterize this dependence explicitly as $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_K d_E T})$ where $T$ is time elapsed, $d_K$ is the Kolmogorov dimension and $d_E$ is the \emph{eluder dimension}. These represent the first unified regret bounds for model-based reinforcement learning and provide state of the art guarantees in several important settings. Moreover, we present a simple and computationally efficient algorithm \emph{posterior sampling for reinforcement learning} (PSRL) that satisfies these bounds.",0
"Abstract: This paper provides an overview of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that leverage a learned internal representation, or ""model,"" of the environment. In this approach, an agent learns both value functions and transition models, enabling more efficient exploration and planning in complex environments. We focus on one particularly effective class of model-based RL algorithms called ""eluders."" These algorithms use a learned latent space to represent transitions as points along trajectories through continuous spaces, which can then be used to plan optimal actions via linear optimization. By carefully designing the latent dynamics, eluder dimension reduction enables realistic movement in complex high-dimensional spaces without sacrificing optimality guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate improved performance across multiple tasks, including discrete navigation problems and continuous control tasks.",1
"Any reinforcement learning algorithm that applies to all Markov decision processes (MDPs) will suffer $\Omega(\sqrt{SAT})$ regret on some MDP, where $T$ is the elapsed time and $S$ and $A$ are the cardinalities of the state and action spaces. This implies $T = \Omega(SA)$ time to guarantee a near-optimal policy. In many settings of practical interest, due to the curse of dimensionality, $S$ and $A$ can be so enormous that this learning time is unacceptable. We establish that, if the system is known to be a \emph{factored} MDP, it is possible to achieve regret that scales polynomially in the number of \emph{parameters} encoding the factored MDP, which may be exponentially smaller than $S$ or $A$. We provide two algorithms that satisfy near-optimal regret bounds in this context: posterior sampling reinforcement learning (PSRL) and an upper confidence bound algorithm (UCRL-Factored).",0

"Reinforcement learning agents have traditionally been evaluated on small toy problems. With advances in computing power and the advent of the Arcade Learning Environment, it is now possible to evaluate algorithms on diverse and difficult problems within a consistent framework. We discuss some challenges posed by the arcade learning environment which do not manifest in simpler environments. We then provide a comparison of model-free, linear learning algorithms on this challenging problem set.",0
"Abstract: This paper investigates how different machine learning (ML) models perform on Atari games within the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). We compare two popular deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), as well as three supervised learning (SL) algorithms: Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree. Our experiments evaluate each model’s ability to learn game strategies that maximize score across multiple environments, as measured by normalized score return. Results show that PPO outperforms SAC in most domains, while SL algorithms generally underperform RL algorithms. Additionally, we find evidence of strong generalization among learned policies, suggesting promising results for future research in applying trained agents from one domain to new unseen ones. Overall, our work adds valuable insights into ML approaches for game playing and provides guidance towards the development of better AIs in complex control tasks beyond simple rule-based systems.",1
"Goals express agents' intentions and allow them to organize their behavior based on low-dimensional abstractions of high-dimensional world states. How can agents develop such goals autonomously? This paper proposes a detailed conceptual and computational account to this longstanding problem. We argue to consider goals as high-level abstractions of lower-level intention mechanisms such as rewards and values, and point out that goals need to be considered alongside with a detection of the own actions' effects. We propose Latent Goal Analysis as a computational learning formulation thereof, and show constructively that any reward or value function can by explained by goals and such self-detection as latent mechanisms. We first show that learned goals provide a highly effective dimensionality reduction in a practical reinforcement learning problem. Then, we investigate a developmental scenario in which entirely task-unspecific rewards induced by visual saliency lead to self and goal representations that constitute goal-directed reaching.",0

"In Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is common to use optimistic initialization of value functions to encourage exploration. However, such an approach generally depends on the domain, viz., the scale of the rewards must be known, and the feature representation must have a constant norm. We present a simple approach that performs optimistic initialization with less dependence on the domain.",0
"Sure! Here's an example abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly popular due to its ability to optimize complex policies in uncertain environments. However, RL algorithms can often suffer from slow convergence rates, which makes them impractical for many real-world applications. One approach to improve convergence speed is through initializing policy parameters close to optimal values before starting optimization. In this work, we introduce a new method called domain-inddependent optimistic initialization that uses historical data to provide a rough estimate of how good the current solution is likely to be. This allows us to initialize policy parameters to be more optimistic than standard methods, resulting in faster convergence speeds on a range of benchmark tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art RL algorithms across a variety of domains, including continuous control problems, discrete actions spaces, and partial observability scenarios. Overall, our results show that domain-independent optimistic initialization is a promising technique for improving the efficiency and scalability of RL algorithms.",1
"Neural Networks sequentially build high-level features through their successive layers. We propose here a new neural network model where each layer is associated with a set of candidate mappings. When an input is processed, at each layer, one mapping among these candidates is selected according to a sequential decision process. The resulting model is structured according to a DAG like architecture, so that a path from the root to a leaf node defines a sequence of transformations. Instead of considering global transformations, like in classical multilayer networks, this model allows us for learning a set of local transformations. It is thus able to process data with different characteristics through specific sequences of such local transformations, increasing the expression power of this model w.r.t a classical multilayered network. The learning algorithm is inspired from policy gradient techniques coming from the reinforcement learning domain and is used here instead of the classical back-propagation based gradient descent techniques. Experiments on different datasets show the relevance of this approach.",0
"Inference speed and accuracy must be discussed as well as limitations. Deep sequential neural networks (DSNNs) are powerful tools capable of solving complex real world problems. These models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging tasks across various domains including image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. DSNNs have made significant strides towards automating artificial intelligence over recent years by training deep neural network architectures on large amounts of data.  Despite their remarkable capabilities, these models are limited in terms of inference speed due to computational requirements. However, advancements in computing technology such as GPU acceleration and distributed systems have enabled efficient deployment of DSNN models in practice. Furthermore, there exists tradeoffs between model complexity, training time, and test accuracy, which must be carefully considered during development. This review focuses on exploring both theoretical foundations and applications of DSNN models, emphasizing recent progress towards faster, smarter, and robust algorithms for a wide range of artificial intelligence tasks.",1
"We consider a reinforcement learning setting introduced in (Maillard et al., NIPS 2011) where the learner does not have explicit access to the states of the underlying Markov decision process (MDP). Instead, she has access to several models that map histories of past interactions to states. Here we improve over known regret bounds in this setting, and more importantly generalize to the case where the models given to the learner do not contain a true model resulting in an MDP representation but only approximations of it. We also give improved error bounds for state aggregation.",0
"This paper presents a method for selecting near-optimal approximate state representations in reinforcement learning (RL). State representation selection is a key step in many RL algorithms as it plays a crucial role in determining the performance of the algorithm. However, existing methods suffer from several limitations such as computational complexity, scalability issues, and poor approximations. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach that combines local feature extraction techniques with global optimization. Our proposed method first extracts low-dimensional features from raw states using deep neural networks, followed by global search to identify the best set of basis functions that provide both efficiency and accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark problems and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of approximation quality and computational efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining local feature extraction with global optimization for state representation selection in RL.",1
"We consider the problem of learning by demonstration from agents acting in unknown stochastic Markov environments or games. Our aim is to estimate agent preferences in order to construct improved policies for the same task that the agents are trying to solve. To do so, we extend previous probabilistic approaches for inverse reinforcement learning in known MDPs to the case of unknown dynamics or opponents. We do this by deriving two simplified probabilistic models of the demonstrator's policy and utility. For tractability, we use maximum a posteriori estimation rather than full Bayesian inference. Under a flat prior, this results in a convex optimisation problem. We find that the resulting algorithms are highly competitive against a variety of other methods for inverse reinforcement learning that do have knowledge of the dynamics.",0
"Probabilistic inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) has been successfully applied to many tasks in both known and unknown environments. However, most IRL algorithms assume that the transition dynamics of the environment are fully known. This assumption may lead to suboptimal policies if there is uncertainty in the transition model. In this paper, we present a novel method for probabilistic IRL in partially observable Markov decision processes where the transition model is treated as latent variables with uncertain parameters, which are inferred simultaneously during policy optimization. We formulate the problem using variational Bayesian inference methods and use Monte Carlo sampling techniques to approximate the posterior distribution over latent variables. Our algorithm allows us to learn robust policies even when the transition model is only estimated from finite samples. Experimental results on benchmarks such as Mountain Car, LunarLanderContinuous and TradingAgent show that our approach achieves better performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.",1
"Kernel-based reinforcement learning (KBRL) stands out among reinforcement learning algorithms for its strong theoretical guarantees. By casting the learning problem as a local kernel approximation, KBRL provides a way of computing a decision policy which is statistically consistent and converges to a unique solution. Unfortunately, the model constructed by KBRL grows with the number of sample transitions, resulting in a computational cost that precludes its application to large-scale or on-line domains. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that turns KBRL into a practical reinforcement learning tool. Kernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) builds on a simple idea: when a transition matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices, one can swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix, potentially much smaller, which retains some fundamental properties of its precursor. KBSF exploits such an insight to compress the information contained in KBRL's model into an approximator of fixed size. This makes it possible to build an approximation that takes into account both the difficulty of the problem and the associated computational cost. KBSF's computational complexity is linear in the number of sample transitions, which is the best one can do without discarding data. Moreover, the algorithm's simple mechanics allow for a fully incremental implementation that makes the amount of memory used independent of the number of sample transitions. The result is a kernel-based reinforcement learning algorithm that can be applied to large-scale problems in both off-line and on-line regimes. We derive upper bounds for the distance between the value functions computed by KBRL and KBSF using the same data. We also illustrate the potential of our algorithm in an extensive empirical study in which KBSF is applied to difficult tasks based on real-world data.",0
"Recently, reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for artificial intelligence systems, enabling agents to learn optimal behaviors from scratch by trial and error without any preconceived knowledge except their sensors observations. Applications of such algorithms range from playing Atari games to controlling robotic manipulators and autonomous vehicles.",1
"Predictive state representations (PSRs) offer an expressive framework for modelling partially observable systems. By compactly representing systems as functions of observable quantities, the PSR learning approach avoids using local-minima prone expectation-maximization and instead employs a globally optimal moment-based algorithm. Moreover, since PSRs do not require a predetermined latent state structure as an input, they offer an attractive framework for model-based reinforcement learning when agents must plan without a priori access to a system model. Unfortunately, the expressiveness of PSRs comes with significant computational cost, and this cost is a major factor inhibiting the use of PSRs in applications. In order to alleviate this shortcoming, we introduce the notion of compressed PSRs (CPSRs). The CPSR learning approach combines recent advancements in dimensionality reduction, incremental matrix decomposition, and compressed sensing. We show how this approach provides a principled avenue for learning accurate approximations of PSRs, drastically reducing the computational costs associated with learning while also providing effective regularization. Going further, we propose a planning framework which exploits these learned models. And we show that this approach facilitates model-learning and planning in large complex partially observable domains, a task that is infeasible without the principled use of compression.",0
"In order to solve complex real world problems optimally under resource constraints like time pressure, scarce computational power etc. one must adopt efficient learning and planning algorithms that can make optimal decisions quickly. The use of prediction in decision making has been proposed as a promising direction for improving the performance of these systems further. However current predictive methods often require large amounts of data storage capacity which becomes problematic for systems using limited computing resources such as embedded devices (i.e., robots, drones, self driving cars) . To overcome this challenge we propose compressing predictions by representing them through succinct summaries called ""compressed predictive states"" (CPS). Our results show significantly faster decision speeds than state-of-the-art predictors while maintaining comparable accuracy. We demonstrate our method on two challenging robotic tasks; 7-DOF arm manipulation and quadruped locomotion.",1
"Tackling large approximate dynamic programming or reinforcement learning problems requires methods that can exploit regularities, or intrinsic structure, of the problem in hand. Most current methods are geared towards exploiting the regularities of either the value function or the policy. We introduce a general classification-based approximate policy iteration (CAPI) framework, which encompasses a large class of algorithms that can exploit regularities of both the value function and the policy space, depending on what is advantageous. This framework has two main components: a generic value function estimator and a classifier that learns a policy based on the estimated value function. We establish theoretical guarantees for the sample complexity of CAPI-style algorithms, which allow the policy evaluation step to be performed by a wide variety of algorithms (including temporal-difference-style methods), and can handle nonparametric representations of policies. Our bounds on the estimation error of the performance loss are tighter than existing results. We also illustrate this approach empirically on several problems, including a large HIV control task.",0
"This paper presents an experiment that focuses on evaluating our proposed method, ""Classification-Based Approximate Policy Iteration"" (CAPA). CAPA combines both model-free evaluation techniques such as classification and regression analysis along with model-based analysis such as planning, simulated decision making, and prediction of state-action values. We evaluate CAPA through several experiments on both large scale continuous control tasks using high quality simulation domains. These results indicate that CAPA can perform competitively while requiring less computation than traditional methods in some cases. We then discuss possible improvements in detail including better ways to balance exploration against exploitation by using a combination of classification-based prediction of actions and approximate linear modeling. Finally we propose several open problems for future work and briefly mention potential applications in other fields beyond artificial intelligence research. In summary, this paper provides new insights into the development of efficient reinforcement learning algorithms with rigorous experimental evaluation. This paper introduces the concept of ""Classification-Based Approximate Policy Iteration"", which is a novel approach to improving upon traditional policy iteration methods used in artificial intelligence research. Through experiments conducted across multiple task types, it has been shown that this method can achieve competitive performance compared to established approaches, but requires fewer computational resources. By combining model-free and model-based techniques, this approach allows agents to make use of predictive models without relying solely on them. While promising, there remains room for improvement; further investigation is recommended for balancing exploration and exploitation and identifying areas where this technique may have broader application outside of artificial intelligence. Ultimately, this work advances our understanding of how advanced machine learning techniques can enhance decision-making processes.",1
"In both the fields of computer science and medicine there is very strong interest in developing personalized treatment policies for patients who have variable responses to treatments. In particular, I aim to find an optimal personalized treatment policy which is a non-deterministic function of the patient specific covariate data that maximizes the expected survival time or clinical outcome. I developed an algorithmic framework to solve multistage decision problem with a varying number of stages that are subject to censoring in which the ""rewards"" are expected survival times. In specific, I developed a novel Q-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts for these parameters. Furthermore, I found finite upper bounds on the generalized error of the treatment paths constructed by this algorithm. I have also shown that when the optimal Q-function is an element of the approximation space, the anticipated survival times for the treatment regime constructed by the algorithm will converge to the optimal treatment path. I demonstrated the performance of the proposed algorithmic framework via simulation studies and through the analysis of chronic depression data and a hypothetical clinical trial. The censored Q-learning algorithm I developed is more effective than the state of the art clinical decision support systems and is able to operate in environments when many covariate parameters may be unobtainable or censored.",0
Recent advances in technology have enabled the development of novel reinforcement learning algorithms capable of personalizing medical treatments based on individual patient characteristics. Incorporating these algorithms into clinical decision making could improve treatment outcomes and reduce costs associated with unnecessary procedures and complications. This study aimed to investigate whether such algorithms can effectively optimize treatment plans tailored to specific patients by evaluating their performance against current state-of-the art methods. Results showed promising improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional approaches. Further research is necessary to evaluate their potential impacts on overall healthcare outcomes before they can be widely adopted.,1
"Demand response (DR) for residential and small commercial buildings is estimated to account for as much as 65% of the total energy savings potential of DR, and previous work shows that a fully automated Energy Management System (EMS) is a necessary prerequisite to DR in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel EMS formulation for DR problems in these sectors. Specifically, we formulate a fully automated EMS's rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and argue that this RL problem can be approximately solved by decomposing it over device clusters. Compared with existing formulations, our new formulation (1) does not require explicitly modeling the user's dissatisfaction on job rescheduling, (2) enables the EMS to self-initiate jobs, (3) allows the user to initiate more flexible requests and (4) has a computational complexity linear in the number of devices. We also demonstrate the simulation results of applying Q-learning, one of the most popular and classical RL algorithms, to a representative example.",0
"Demand response (DR) involves modulating electricity usage by consumers to better match fluctuating supply availability on power grids. DR has become increasingly important as renewables penetration on grid systems continues to grow, requiring more flexible load management solutions. Traditional approaches to DR have relied primarily on time-of-use tariffs, where customers are charged different rates based on peak vs. off-peak demand times. This approach can be limited since it requires customer participation to reduce consumption during high cost periods, without consideration of underlying consumer preferences or behaviors. In contrast, recent work suggests that device level flexibility can offer improved efficiency and increased utilization of existing infrastructure for DR programs. This study presents a novel methodology using device based reinforcement learning to optimize demand response decision making within complex distribution networks while respecting individual preferences. We propose three distinct algorithms which provide automated control decisions for devices under uncertainty: Q Learning; Deep Q Networks; and Proximal Policy Optimization. The evaluation shows that all three methods achieve significant improvements in energy saving compared to traditional time-based DR strategies, while maintaining satisfactory levels of user comfort. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how these models benefit from additional contextual data such as weather forecasts or dynamic pricing signals. Our findings confirm the feasibility of implementing device level demand response solutions through machine learning techniques that take advantage of diverse device features. Ultimately, we expect this research to facilitate development of next generation DR platforms capable of optimizing grid balancing tasks at scale.",1
"Applying convolutional neural networks to large images is computationally expensive because the amount of computation scales linearly with the number of image pixels. We present a novel recurrent neural network model that is capable of extracting information from an image or video by adaptively selecting a sequence of regions or locations and only processing the selected regions at high resolution. Like convolutional neural networks, the proposed model has a degree of translation invariance built-in, but the amount of computation it performs can be controlled independently of the input image size. While the model is non-differentiable, it can be trained using reinforcement learning methods to learn task-specific policies. We evaluate our model on several image classification tasks, where it significantly outperforms a convolutional neural network baseline on cluttered images, and on a dynamic visual control problem, where it learns to track a simple object without an explicit training signal for doing so.",0
"Recurrent models have shown promise in capturing contextual dependencies across time, especially given their ability to memorize sequences and store information over multiple steps. One key challenge facing these models is scaling up computationally to handle large input sizes. Many approaches have been proposed that address computational efficiency while sacrificing some degree of model expressivity. We propose using a different strategy which combines convolutional networks and recurrence to efficiently capture visual attention dynamics while achieving strong performance on benchmark datasets. Our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art techniques by exploiting cross-attention mechanisms within recurrent layers to improve precision at low computational cost. Experiments demonstrate compelling results across tasks, including image generation, caption generation, and human evaluation metrics such as Rouge. These findings suggest promising directions for future work, particularly regarding the integration of non-local operations into deep learning architectures. In summary, we introduce a novel approach for visual attentional processing with impressive empirical results. Its scalability and effectiveness provide evidence towards its potential impact beyond computer vision applications.",1
"Recent work has demonstrated that problems-- particularly imitation learning and structured prediction-- where a learner's predictions influence the input-distribution it is tested on can be naturally addressed by an interactive approach and analyzed using no-regret online learning. These approaches to imitation learning, however, neither require nor benefit from information about the cost of actions. We extend existing results in two directions: first, we develop an interactive imitation learning approach that leverages cost information; second, we extend the technique to address reinforcement learning. The results provide theoretical support to the commonly observed successes of online approximate policy iteration. Our approach suggests a broad new family of algorithms and provides a unifying view of existing techniques for imitation and reinforcement learning.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to learning from experience based on an algorithm that can both reinforce good decisions and learn by imitating others in real time. We propose interactive no-regret learning (INRL), which combines methods from reinforcement learning and social learning to achieve superior results across multiple domains. INRL uses neural networks to approximate value functions and select actions according to their expected returns while accounting for model uncertainty using Thompson sampling techniques. By incorporating feedback into its learning process, INRL continually improves over time without any explicit exploration strategies. Our experiments show that INRL outperforms traditional RL algorithms as well as prior methods that combine RL and IL, demonstrating its effectiveness at maximizing rewards in complex environments. Importantly, our method allows agents to learn directly from human expert demonstrations or other sources of knowledge, making it particularly attractive for multiagent systems and decision support applications where rapid adaptation is essential but complete automation may not always be feasible. Overall, this work represents a significant step towards developing intelligent agents that can effectively learn and act in unpredictable settings with minimal supervision.

"In this paper, we set forth a new vision of reinforcement learning developed by us over the past few years, one that yields mathematically rigorous solutions to longstanding important questions that have remained unresolved: (i) how to design reliable, convergent, and robust reinforcement learning algorithms (ii) how to guarantee that reinforcement learning satisfies pre-specified ""safety"" guarantees, and remains in a stable region of the parameter space (iii) how to design ""off-policy"" temporal difference learning algorithms in a reliable and stable manner, and finally (iv) how to integrate the study of reinforcement learning into the rich theory of stochastic optimization. In this paper, we provide detailed answers to all these questions using the powerful framework of proximal operators.   The key idea that emerges is the use of primal dual spaces connected through the use of a Legendre transform. This allows temporal difference updates to occur in dual spaces, allowing a variety of important technical advantages. The Legendre transform elegantly generalizes past algorithms for solving reinforcement learning problems, such as natural gradient methods, which we show relate closely to the previously unconnected framework of mirror descent methods. Equally importantly, proximal operator theory enables the systematic development of operator splitting methods that show how to safely and reliably decompose complex products of gradients that occur in recent variants of gradient-based temporal difference learning. This key technical innovation makes it possible to finally design ""true"" stochastic gradient methods for reinforcement learning. Finally, Legendre transforms enable a variety of other benefits, including modeling sparsity and domain geometry. Our work builds extensively on recent work on the convergence of saddle-point algorithms, and on the theory of monotone operators.",0
"This sounds like a fascinating topic! Can you tell me more about proximal reinforcement learning? I’m interested in learning how it differs from traditional forms of sequential decision making, as well as its potential applications.

"In this paper we consider the problem of online stochastic optimization of a locally smooth function under bandit feedback. We introduce the high-confidence tree (HCT) algorithm, a novel any-time $\mathcal{X}$-armed bandit algorithm, and derive regret bounds matching the performance of existing state-of-the-art in terms of dependency on number of steps and smoothness factor. The main advantage of HCT is that it handles the challenging case of correlated rewards, whereas existing methods require that the reward-generating process of each arm is an identically and independent distributed (iid) random process. HCT also improves on the state-of-the-art in terms of its memory requirement as well as requiring a weaker smoothness assumption on the mean-reward function in compare to the previous anytime algorithms. Finally, we discuss how HCT can be applied to the problem of policy search in reinforcement learning and we report preliminary empirical results.",0
"Online stochastic optimization problems involve making sequential decisions based on noisy observations of the objective function. In many cases, these noise assumptions may not hold, and instead there could be strong correlations across arms. We consider the case where correlation exists across multiple rounds of observation within each arm but not necessarily across different arms. To handle this setting, we propose two new algorithms: one that uses Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) style exploration, and another that uses Thompson Sampling. Our first algorithm, called Maxmin-MAB, maximizes regret over the minimum mean outcome across all actions at each round using linear programming duality. This choice has some nice theoretical properties such as guaranteeing low regret even if the number of arms is large compared to the sample size from each action. For our second algorithm, we make a novel modification to the standard Thompson Sampling update rule by incorporating recent past reward observations into our estimate of the posterior distribution. By doing so, we can reduce variability in estimates which improves overall performance. Through empirical evaluation, we find both algorithms perform better than existing methods, including LinTS which assumes independence among arms. Moreover, the modifications made to Thompson Sampling lead to improvements in both high and low signal strength regimes. Overall, our work provides improved algorithms for handling more realistic settings of online stochastic optimization problems while maintaining good practical performance.",1
"Batch Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms attempt to choose a policy from a designer-provided class of policies given a fixed set of training data. Choosing the policy which maximizes an estimate of return often leads to over-fitting when only limited data is available, due to the size of the policy class in relation to the amount of data available. In this work, we focus on learning policy classes that are appropriately sized to the amount of data available. We accomplish this by using the principle of Structural Risk Minimization, from Statistical Learning Theory, which uses Rademacher complexity to identify a policy class that maximizes a bound on the return of the best policy in the chosen policy class, given the available data. Unlike similar batch RL approaches, our bound on return requires only extremely weak assumptions on the true system.",0
"Recent advances have shown that the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms can often be improved by focusing on structured value functions as opposed to generic ones. However, most existing work in this area has focused on optimality metrics such as expected return or state visitation frequency. In practice though, these objectives may differ from actual returns experienced by agents due to factors such as stochasticity, non-linear interactions and sparse reward signals. Our paper instead proposes a new algorithmic framework that directly maximizes structured return under a given policy while maintaining low Bellman error. We showcase through several experiments that our approach outperforms prior methods by significant margins across a wide range of domains including continuous control environments like MountainCar-V2 and Hopper-v4, and discrete action spaces in games like PacMan-v0 and Space Invaders Extreme. To ensure reproducibility, we release code along with our submission and strongly encourage others to build upon our findings.",1
"This paper proposes an online tree-based Bayesian approach for reinforcement learning. For inference, we employ a generalised context tree model. This defines a distribution on multivariate Gaussian piecewise-linear models, which can be updated in closed form. The tree structure itself is constructed using the cover tree method, which remains efficient in high dimensional spaces. We combine the model with Thompson sampling and approximate dynamic programming to obtain effective exploration policies in unknown environments. The flexibility and computational simplicity of the model render it suitable for many reinforcement learning problems in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate this in an experimental comparison with least squares policy iteration.",0

"Ubiquitous information access becomes more and more important nowadays and research is aimed at making it adapted to users. Our work consists in applying machine learning techniques in order to bring a solution to some of the problems concerning the acceptance of the system by users. To achieve this, we propose a fundamental shift in terms of how we model the learning of recommender system: inspired by models of human reasoning developed in robotic, we combine reinforcement learning and case-base reasoning to define a recommendation process that uses these two approaches for generating recommendations on different context dimensions (social, temporal, geographic). We describe an implementation of the recommender system based on this framework. We also present preliminary results from experiments with the system and show how our approach increases the recommendation quality.",0
"An effective ubiquitous recommender system requires accurate recognition of user preferences and real-time adaptation to their changing needs. This study presents a hybrid Q-learning approach that combines both model-based and model-free learning methods to improve recommendation accuracy. By utilizing model-based learning, our method can exploit prior knowledge of user behavior patterns to reduce exploration time and speed up convergence. On the other hand, model-free learning allows our algorithm to adapt to changes in user preferences over time without relying on explicit models. Our evaluation shows that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art ubiquitous recommender systems in terms of precision and recall metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our solution by applying it to large datasets.

"We compare the performance of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) with the relative new model of Multi-agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL). Before comparing the methods, we extend a published Bayesian IRL approach that is only applicable to the case where the reward is only state dependent to a general one capable of tackling the case where the reward depends on both state and action. Comparison between IRL and MIRL is made in the context of an abstract soccer game, using both a game model in which the reward depends only on state and one in which it depends on both state and action. Results suggest that the IRL approach performs much worse than the MIRL approach. We speculate that the underperformance of IRL is because it fails to capture equilibrium information in the manner possible in MIRL.",0
"Abstract: This study compares multi-agent inverse learning (MAIL) against single-agent inverse learning (SAIL) on a simulated soccer example. MAIL involves training multiple agents together to learn from their interactions in the environment, while SAIL focuses on training a single agent to mimic human demonstrations. Both approaches have been shown to effectively imitate expert behavior but differ in terms of computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that MAIL outperforms SAIL in both accuracy and speed, particularly when dealing with more complex tasks. We conclude that MAIL represents a promising approach to inverse learning, offering significant benefits over traditional methods such as supervised learning. However, further research is required to fully evaluate the potential applications of MAIL in real-world settings.",1
"Recent advances in Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) have shown that Bayes-optimality is theoretically achievable by modeling the environment's latent dynamics using Flat-Dirichlet-Multinomial (FDM) prior. In self-interested multi-agent environments, the transition dynamics are mainly controlled by the other agent's stochastic behavior for which FDM's independence and modeling assumptions do not hold. As a result, FDM does not allow the other agent's behavior to be generalized across different states nor specified using prior domain knowledge. To overcome these practical limitations of FDM, we propose a generalization of BRL to integrate the general class of parametric models and model priors, thus allowing practitioners' domain knowledge to be exploited to produce a fine-grained and compact representation of the other agent's behavior. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach outperforms existing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.",0
"This paper provides a general framework for optimizing interactions with self-interested agents who have arbitrary objectives and can take any actions that may affect these objectives. We consider situations where each party's goal is to maximize their own expected utility, which depends on their prior beliefs as well as the outcomes of possible joint actions. Our framework allows both parties to update their beliefs and select optimal actions based on a shared model and prior distribution over unknown parameters governing the dynamics of the system. We provide conditions under which Bayesian decision theory ensures that the chosen action profile leads to mutual benefit, even if one agent has more knowledge or computational power than the other. By incorporating both prior distributions and the ability to use models with unknown parameters, our approach offers significant flexibility in handling complex real-world problems involving strategic behavior and uncertainty. Overall, we aim to establish a foundation for developing efficient algorithms that can optimize interactive decisions involving rational agents with diverse preferences and constraints.",1
"We extend the framework of efficient coding, which has been used to model the development of sensory processing in isolation, to model the development of the perception/action cycle. Our extension combines sparse coding and reinforcement learning so that sensory processing and behavior co-develop to optimize a shared intrinsic motivational signal: the fidelity of the neural encoding of the sensory input under resource constraints. Applying this framework to a model system consisting of an active eye behaving in a time varying environment, we find that this generic principle leads to the simultaneous development of both smooth pursuit behavior and model neurons whose properties are similar to those of primary visual cortical neurons selective for different directions of visual motion. We suggest that this general principle may form the basis for a unified and integrated explanation of many perception/action loops.",0
"Our goal is to develop intrinsically motivated agents that can learn complex tasks without explicit rewards or guidance. One such task involves visual motion perception and smooth pursuit eye movements. Typical approaches use supervised learning techniques which often require large amounts of labeled data. However, collecting high quality labels is difficult due to the complexity of these behaviors and their interaction with other cognitive processes. To address this challenge we present a novel deep neural network architecture called Deep Active Vision (DAV), designed to interact with its environment through actions such as saccade and pursuit movements. DAV learns to predict the reward obtained by imagining performing different motor acts while observing natural scenes containing motions. This allows our agent to learn visuomotor control policies that are effective at perceiving and tracking objects under cluttered conditions even with noisy actuation. We evaluate our approach on several challenges including object detection, smooth pursuit, and active search tasks. Our results demonstrate that DAV significantly outperforms strong baseline models trained using human annotated bounding boxes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Importantly, analysis reveals that learned representations capture semantic concepts relevant for each task while explicitly avoiding the need for external feedback signals. Overall, our work introduces a new paradigm for solving challenging vision problems through embodied active exploration alone, paving the way for future progress towards general, intelligent agents.",1
"Learning policies that generalize across multiple tasks is an important and challenging research topic in reinforcement learning and robotics. Training individual policies for every single potential task is often impractical, especially for continuous task variations, requiring more principled approaches to share and transfer knowledge among similar tasks. We present a novel approach for learning a nonlinear feedback policy that generalizes across multiple tasks. The key idea is to define a parametrized policy as a function of both the state and the task, which allows learning a single policy that generalizes across multiple known and unknown tasks. Applications of our novel approach to reinforcement and imitation learning in real-robot experiments are shown.",0
"Title: Multi-Task Policy Search: Improving Robot Control through Shared Learning  Abstract: In robotics research, controlling robots effectively in complex environments often requires multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously, such as navigating obstacles while grasping objects. Conventional approaches involve designing separate policies for each individual task, which can lead to suboptimal performance and increased computational cost due to redundant learning. In contrast, multi-task policy search methods aim to improve the efficiency of learning by sharing knowledge across different tasks. This study proposes a novel approach for multi-task policy search that utilizes shared neural networks to learn policies for multiple tasks concurrently. We evaluate our method on several challenging control problems and demonstrate significant improvements over both single-task baselines and other state-of-the-art multi-task reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results showcase the effectiveness and potential benefits of using multi-task learning techniques for improving robotic control in real-world scenarios. These findings may have implications for diverse applications in robotics including manipulation, navigation, and human-robot interaction.",1
"In this paper, we consider the important problem of safe exploration in reinforcement learning. While reinforcement learning is well-suited to domains with complex transition dynamics and high-dimensional state-action spaces, an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration. Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks, where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system (or any other system). Consequently, when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and high-dimensional state-action space, an important question arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment. We evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks: automatic car parking, pole-balancing, helicopter hovering, and business management.",0
"This study explores the problem of safe exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, agents learn by taking actions and observing their consequences, maximizing cumulative rewards over time. However, these policies can often result in unintended behaviors due to incomplete knowledge of state and action spaces. To address this issue, we propose several methods for safely exploring unknown regions of the state space while minimizing negative outcomes. Our first approach uses risk-aware curiosity motivation techniques which encourage the agent to learn new skills while managing risks. We then present two novel algorithms that allow the agent to plan optimal trajectories through partially known environments using model-based reasoning. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our methodology in robotics, healthcare, and other domains where safety is critical. Overall, our work provides insights into safe exploration strategies in complex systems and has important implications for building more reliable artificial intelligence.",1
"We derive a family of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods for agents, who face sequential decision-making tasks in uncertain environments. By applying a utility function to the temporal difference (TD) error, nonlinear transformations are effectively applied not only to the received rewards but also to the true transition probabilities of the underlying Markov decision process. When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents' behaviors express key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), for example different risk-preferences for gains and losses as well as the shape of subjective probability curves. We derive a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, which is necessary for modeling human behavior when transition probabilities are unknown, and prove its convergence. As a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework we apply it to quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find, that the risk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral data and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses which is indeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured fMRI signals show a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive TD error with BOLD signal change in the ventral striatum. In addition we find a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive Q-values with neural activity in the striatum, cingulate cortex and insula, which is not present if standard Q-values are used.",0
"Abstract: This abstract presents a new method of reinforcement learning that takes risk into consideration during decision making. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms only focus on maximizing expected rewards without considering potential risks associated with taking certain actions. However, many real-world scenarios require agents to make decisions under uncertainty, where there might be significant consequences if things go wrong. Our proposed approach introduces a novel risk measure that captures both variability and skewness in outcomes and incorporates them directly into the value function estimation process. We demonstrate through experiments how our method leads to more robust behavior compared to state-of-the-art methods in uncertain environments. Additionally, we showcase the efficacy of our approach across different domains such as finance, healthcare, robotics, and games. Overall, our work offers exciting insights into creating reliable AI systems capable of handling high stakes situations while accounting for their impact on society at large.

"Because reinforcement learning suffers from a lack of scalability, online value (and Q-) function approximation has received increasing interest this last decade. This contribution introduces a novel approximation scheme, namely the Kalman Temporal Differences (KTD) framework, that exhibits the following features: sample-efficiency, non-linear approximation, non-stationarity handling and uncertainty management. A first KTD-based algorithm is provided for deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) which produces biased estimates in the case of stochastic transitions. Than the eXtended KTD framework (XKTD), solving stochastic MDP, is described. Convergence is analyzed for special cases for both deterministic and stochastic transitions. Related algorithms are experimented on classical benchmarks. They compare favorably to the state of the art while exhibiting the announced features.",0
"This paper presents a novel methodology called ""Kalman Temporal Difference"" (KTD) that leverages the strengths of two classic modeling frameworks - the Kalman filter and temporal difference learning. KTD combines these methods in order to improve the accuracy and stability of predictions made by dynamic models. By doing so, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with an enhanced toolset that can tackle real-world problems with greater efficiency and effectiveness than existing approaches. In this paper, we describe the mathematical foundations of KTD and evaluate its performance on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority compared to popular baseline models. We believe that our work offers important insights into how different types of models can be blended together in innovative ways to achieve more accurate and robust predictions. Our findings have implications for both academic and industrial applications where predictive models play a crucial role. Overall, we hope that this contribution serves as a stepping stone towards further advancements in the field of dynamic prediction using machine learning techniques.",1
"Several multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to optimize agents decisions. Due to the complexity of the problem, the majority of the previously developed MARL algorithms assumed agents either had some knowledge of the underlying game (such as Nash equilibria) and/or observed other agents actions and the rewards they received.   We introduce a new MARL algorithm called the Weighted Policy Learner (WPL), which allows agents to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in benchmark 2-player-2-action games with minimum knowledge. Using WPL, the only feedback an agent needs is its own local reward (the agent does not observe other agents actions or rewards). Furthermore, WPL does not assume that agents know the underlying game or the corresponding Nash Equilibrium a priori. We experimentally show that our algorithm converges in benchmark two-player-two-action games. We also show that our algorithm converges in the challenging Shapleys game where previous MARL algorithms failed to converge without knowing the underlying game or the NE. Furthermore, we show that WPL outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in a more realistic setting of 100 agents interacting and learning concurrently.   An important aspect of understanding the behavior of a MARL algorithm is analyzing the dynamics of the algorithm: how the policies of multiple learning agents evolve over time as agents interact with one another. Such an analysis not only verifies whether agents using a given MARL algorithm will eventually converge, but also reveals the behavior of the MARL algorithm prior to convergence. We analyze our algorithm in two-player-two-action games and show that symbolically proving WPLs convergence is difficult, because of the non-linear nature of WPLs dynamics, unlike previous MARL algorithms that had either linear or piece-wise-linear dynamics. Instead, we numerically solve WPLs dynamics differential equations and compare the solution to the dynamics of previous MARL algorithms.",0
"In our recently published research article ""A Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Algorithm with Non-linear Dynamics,"" we present a new approach to multiagent reinforcement learning that addresses some of the limitations of existing methods in handling non-linear dynamics. The problem addressed by this work has been previously studied using linear approximations but these approaches have limited accuracy due to the complex nature of many real world systems. Our algorithm incorporates a novel neural network architecture which captures both state-value functions as well as policy gradients into one model. This allows us to learn more complex features while preserving stability during training. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulation studies on multiple benchmark domains as well as a high fidelity robotic manipulation task where our method outperforms the current state-of-the art by significant margins. Overall, our results demonstrate that our proposed approach provides promising solutions to tackle complex problems in multiagent settings with nonlinear dynamics. Future works can extend this framework for distributed executions with communication constraints and further investigate different design choices such as exploration mechanisms.",1
"Most provably-efficient learning algorithms introduce optimism about poorly-understood states and actions to encourage exploration. We study an alternative approach for efficient exploration, posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL). This algorithm proceeds in repeated episodes of known duration. At the start of each episode, PSRL updates a prior distribution over Markov decision processes and takes one sample from this posterior. PSRL then follows the policy that is optimal for this sample during the episode. The algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally efficient and allows an agent to encode prior knowledge in a natural way. We establish an $\tilde{O}(\tau S \sqrt{AT})$ bound on the expected regret, where $T$ is time, $\tau$ is the episode length and $S$ and $A$ are the cardinalities of the state and action spaces. This bound is one of the first for an algorithm not based on optimism, and close to the state of the art for any reinforcement learning algorithm. We show through simulation that PSRL significantly outperforms existing algorithms with similar regret bounds.",0
"This is an excellent paper that provides valuable insights into efficient reinforcement learning algorithms through the use of posterior sampling techniques. The authors present their findings on how using posterior sampling can improve learning efficiency by better utilizing data collected during training. By comparing different algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Q-Learning, they demonstrate that posterior sampling leads to faster convergence rates and improved performance overall. Furthermore, the authors explore potential limitations and open challenges related to implementing these methods in real-world applications. Overall, the research presented in this paper contributes significantly to our understanding of efficient reinforcement learning and has exciting implications for future work in artificial intelligence.",1
"We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.",0
"This paper describes how we trained agents using deep reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and actor-critic methods to play classic Atari video games. We demonstrate that our agents can perform well on many challenging tasks, including racing cars and solving mazes. Our approach relies on the ability of the agent to learn from trial-and-error, receiving feedback in terms of reward signals which indicate whether actions taken were correct or incorrect. By optimizing these objective functions over time, our agents gradually improve their performance at specific tasks. Our results show that deep reinforcement learning can indeed generate human-level performance, but they also raise interesting questions about whether these results generalize across domains and whether there may be fundamental limits to what current algorithms can achieve. Overall, we believe that these findings have important implications for understanding intelligence and rationality in artificial systems.",1
"Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, finding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayes-optimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a significant margin on several well-known benchmark problems -- because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an infinite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to model-based reinforcement learning that combines elements of both Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and model predictive control (MPC). Our method, called Bayesian Adaptive Model Predictive Control (BAMP), uses sampled models learned by MCTS to generate feedback controllers for achieving task goals while minimizing a cost function. By exploiting the uncertainty estimates from BAMP, we can improve policy improvement by balancing exploration and exploitation based on confidence intervals rather than point estimation. We validate our method through simulation experiments across multiple domains and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the art methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization and Rainbow DQN. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis of regret bounds which suggest low regret policies under reasonable assumptions. Overall, our work shows promise in enabling efficient Bayes-adaptive reinforcement learning with model predictive control via sample-based search.",1
"In this paper, we push forward the idea of machine learning systems whose operators can be modified and fine-tuned for each problem. This allows us to propose a learning paradigm where users can write (or adapt) their operators, according to the problem, data representation and the way the information should be navigated. To achieve this goal, data instances, background knowledge, rules, programs and operators are all written in the same functional language, Erlang. Since changing operators affect how the search space needs to be explored, heuristics are learnt as a result of a decision process based on reinforcement learning where each action is defined as a choice of operator and rule. As a result, the architecture can be seen as a 'system for writing machine learning systems' or to explore new operators where the policy reuse (as a kind of transfer learning) is allowed. States and actions are represented in a Q matrix which is actually a table, from which a supervised model is learnt. This makes it possible to have a more flexible mapping between old and new problems, since we work with an abstraction of rules and actions. We include some examples sharing reuse and the application of the system gErl to IQ problems. In order to evaluate gErl, we will test it against some structured problems: a selection of IQ test tasks and some experiments on some structured prediction problems (list patterns).",0
"Learning systems have been a topic of interest for several years, as they offer a wide range of applications in many areas such as science, engineering, business, healthcare, education, and more. One critical aspect that has been studied extensively is the definition of a learning system itself, as there is no universal agreement on how these systems should be constructed or operated. In ""On the Definition of a General Learning System with User-Defined Operators,"" we aim to provide a comprehensive approach to defining a learning system with user-customizable components. By doing so, users can tailor their learning experiences according to their specific needs and preferences. This allows for increased flexibility in choosing different types of algorithms, data structures, and other features depending on each problem domain. We propose using the concept of metaobject protocols (MOPs) to build a metaobject-oriented programming language capable of supporting learning systems. MOPs allow us to define custom operations at runtime, which enables developers to create novel learning systems without having extensive knowledge of computer languages. Additionally, we present concrete examples of building learning systems using our proposed methodology to showcase its effectiveness. Overall, our work offers researchers, practitioners, and educators a unique perspective on designing and developing learning systems with greater flexibility and scalability, making them suitable for use across diverse application domains.",1
"Sophisticated multilayer neural networks have achieved state of the art results on multiple supervised tasks. However, successful applications of such multilayer networks to control have so far been limited largely to the perception portion of the control pipeline. In this paper, we explore the application of deep and recurrent neural networks to a continuous, high-dimensional locomotion task, where the network is used to represent a control policy that maps the state of the system (represented by joint angles) directly to the torques at each joint. By using a recent reinforcement learning algorithm called guided policy search, we can successfully train neural network controllers with thousands of parameters, allowing us to compare a variety of architectures. We discuss the differences between the locomotion control task and previous supervised perception tasks, present experimental results comparing various architectures, and discuss future directions in the application of techniques from deep learning to the problem of optimal control.",0

"Reinforcement learning has gained wide popularity as a technique for simulation-driven approximate dynamic programming. A less known aspect is that the very reasons that make it effective in dynamic programming can also be leveraged for using it for distributed schemes for certain matrix computations involving non-negative matrices. In this spirit, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm for PageRank computation that is fashioned after analogous schemes for approximate dynamic programming. The algorithm has the advantage of ease of distributed implementation and more importantly, of being model-free, i.e., not dependent on any specific assumptions about the transition probabilities in the random web-surfer model. We analyze its convergence and finite time behavior and present some supporting numerical experiments.",0
"Matrix computations play a crucial role in many real-world applications ranging from social network analysis to natural language processing. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for optimizing these matrix operations. RL algorithms learn how to make decisions based on feedback received through interactions with their environment. This paper presents a case study on using RL for solving one of the most popular problems in graph theory, known as the PageRank problem. PageRank is used by search engines like Google to rank web pages based on their link structure. We introduce a new formulation of the PageRank problem that can be solved directly using existing RL techniques without any modifications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods such as power iteration and the Conjugate Gradient algorithm in terms of accuracy and speed. Our experiments show that our approach achieves up to three times faster convergence compared to the state-of-the-art methods while producing comparable solutions. These findings suggest that RL holds great potential for improving matrix computations in practice.",1
"Transferring knowledge across a sequence of reinforcement-learning tasks is challenging, and has a number of important applications. Though there is encouraging empirical evidence that transfer can improve performance in subsequent reinforcement-learning tasks, there has been very little theoretical analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-task algorithm for a sequence of reinforcement-learning tasks when each task is sampled independently from (an unknown) distribution over a finite set of Markov decision processes whose parameters are initially unknown. For this setting, we prove under certain assumptions that the per-task sample complexity of exploration is reduced significantly due to transfer compared to standard single-task algorithms. Our multi-task algorithm also has the desired characteristic that it is guaranteed not to exhibit negative transfer: in the worst case its per-task sample complexity is comparable to the corresponding single-task algorithm.",0
"This is an abstract summarizing the results from ""Sample complexity of multi-task reinforcement learning"", discussing sample efficiency differences between two architectures for deep RL models trained on multiple tasks: the centralised training scheme (CTS) where each task contributes equally to model update, and the decentralized training scheme (DTS) where only active tasks contribute. Results show that DTS has lower overall sample complexity but higher per-task complexity due to increased stochastic variability compared to CTS which is more regularized across all tasks by default. These insights improve our understanding of sample efficient MTL and could lead to improved algorithms tailored for different use cases. Here is a possible outline structure for this abstract: * Introduction to multi-task RL research field * Problem statement 	+ Existing approaches (brief overview) * Methods (explain both architectures in depth + how experiments were run) * Results obtained 	+ Comparison of cumulative regret curves * Implications / Discussion (compared to other work) 	+ Strengths/Weaknesses * Future Research / Conclusion. Here’s an example abstract based on the instructions provided: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTL) has emerged as an important area of study in artificial intelligence, as many real world problems involve solving multiple tasks simultaneously. However, one major challenge facing researchers is finding ways to efficiently learn these tasks using limited amounts of data. In this paper, we compare the performance of two different architectures for deep RL models trained on multiple tasks: the centralized training scheme (CTS), where each task contributes equally to the model updates, and the decentralized training scheme (DTS), where only active tasks contribute. Our experiments reveal that while DTS leads to better overall performance and faster convergence times, it comes at the cost of greater variability among individual tasks. Overall, these findings provide new insight into the tradeoffs involved in designing MTL systems and highlight opportunities for future research. By building on our work, researchers may be able to develop even more effective methods tailored to specific applications domains.",1
We present a new algorithm for general reinforcement learning where the true environment is known to belong to a finite class of N arbitrary models. The algorithm is shown to be near-optimal for all but O(N log^2 N) time-steps with high probability. Infinite classes are also considered where we show that compactness is a key criterion for determining the existence of uniform sample-complexity bounds. A matching lower bound is given for the finite case.,0
"This paper presents theoretical results on the sample complexity of general reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, showing that they can learn optimal policies using very few samples of experience. We prove bounds on both the number of episodes required by RL agents to achieve certain accuracy thresholds on their Q values, as well as regret bounds on simple policies such as tabular Q-learning and deep neural network Q-learning methods. These bounds hold for any policy class, including those that require exact evaluation of the action value function at all states visited during training, and thus provide strong evidence that modern RL techniques, even those based on highly expressive models like deep networks, can perform well with small amounts of data. Finally, we present experiments which verify these findings: simple Q-learners trained on modest datasets from popular benchmark control domains are able to attain performance exceeding that achieved by human expert players across many Atari games. Our analysis offers concrete insights into what makes RL challenging, how little data may still lead to high quality solutions, and why model design choices matter less than assumed under tight computational constraints. Taken together, our work provides practical encouragement to the development of efficient AIs that learn effectively from real-world interactions with minimal supervision.",1
"Learning from prior tasks and transferring that experience to improve future performance is critical for building lifelong learning agents. Although results in supervised and reinforcement learning show that transfer may significantly improve the learning performance, most of the literature on transfer is focused on batch learning tasks. In this paper we study the problem of \textit{sequential transfer in online learning}, notably in the multi-armed bandit framework, where the objective is to minimize the cumulative regret over a sequence of tasks by incrementally transferring knowledge from prior tasks. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm based on a method-of-moments approach for the estimation of the possible tasks and derive regret bounds for it.",0
"In this paper we present a new approach, called sequential transfer learning (STL), that extends multi-armed bandits into settings where experts have fixed policies but may change at unknown times during the horizon. We prove novel bounds on the cumulative regret under any set of expert sequences, including all possible permutations of changes. This result unifies two previously separate lines of work: stochastic bandits with switching costs, which we generalize by allowing for more flexible models; and transfer learning from non-stationary data streams, which we formalize as a new setting inspired by online machine learning applications such as recommendation systems and adaptive routing in communication networks. Our framework exploits the structure of sets of static models to achieve minimax optimal tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation with respect to each policy before and after transfers occur, without sacrificing performance relative to the case with no transfers. Finally, our extensive experiments demonstrate STL’s competitive and robust empirical behavior across many problem sizes, configurations, and types of functions.",1
"The goal of reinforcement learning (RL) is to let an agent learn an optimal control policy in an unknown environment so that future expected rewards are maximized. The model-free RL approach directly learns the policy based on data samples. Although using many samples tends to improve the accuracy of policy learning, collecting a large number of samples is often expensive in practice. On the other hand, the model-based RL approach first estimates the transition model of the environment and then learns the policy based on the estimated transition model. Thus, if the transition model is accurately learned from a small amount of data, the model-based approach can perform better than the model-free approach. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based RL method by combining a recently proposed model-free policy search method called policy gradients with parameter-based exploration and the state-of-the-art transition model estimator called least-squares conditional density estimation. Through experiments, we demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.",0
"In recent years, model-based policy gradient methods have emerged as powerful tools for solving high-dimensional continuous control problems. These methods leverage the use of learned models to guide exploration towards promising regions of state space, allowing agents to more efficiently learn effective policies. However, existing model-based policy gradient algorithms often require handcrafted models that may limit their applicability to complex real-world environments. To address these limitations, we propose a new model-free approach called ""Least Squares Policy Search"" (LS-PS) that can operate directly on raw sensor inputs without requiring explicit state representations or dynamical models. LS-PS uses least-squares conditional density estimation to learn a parameterized probability distribution over actions given sensory observations. By optimizing policy parameters under this probabilistic model, our algorithm balances exploitation and exploration effectively while accounting for aleatoric uncertainty due to sensor noise. Our experimental results show that LS-PS outperforms competitive baselines across several challenging reinforcement learning tasks, including discrete actions settings where conventional model-based approaches struggle. Overall, our work advances both theoretical understanding and practical application of model-based policy search techniques in sequential decision making under uncertainty.",1
"In some reinforcement learning problems an agent may be provided with a set of input policies, perhaps learned from prior experience or provided by advisors. We present a reinforcement learning with policy advice (RLPA) algorithm which leverages this input set and learns to use the best policy in the set for the reinforcement learning task at hand. We prove that RLPA has a sub-linear regret of \tilde O(\sqrt{T}) relative to the best input policy, and that both this regret and its computational complexity are independent of the size of the state and action space. Our empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis. This suggests RLPA may offer significant advantages in large domains where some prior good policies are provided.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing regret bounds for reinforcement learning algorithms that incorporate policy advice. These bounds provide a theoretical guarantee on the performance of the algorithm relative to the optimal policy, and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches. This paper presents a new methodology for obtaining regret bounds for reinforcement learning with policy advice using the concept of self-normalized martingales. We show that our approach leads to tighter regret bounds than previous methods, and we illustrate the advantages of our technique through numerical experiments. Our work contributes to the growing body of research focused on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of reinforcement learning algorithms with policy advice.",1
"We consider the problem of learning by demonstration from agents acting in unknown stochastic Markov environments or games. Our aim is to estimate agent preferences in order to construct improved policies for the same task that the agents are trying to solve. To do so, we extend previous probabilistic approaches for inverse reinforcement learning in known MDPs to the case of unknown dynamics or opponents. We do this by deriving two simplified probabilistic models of the demonstrator's policy and utility. For tractability, we use maximum a posteriori estimation rather than full Bayesian inference. Under a flat prior, this results in a convex optimisation problem. We find that the resulting algorithms are highly competitive against a variety of other methods for inverse reinforcement learning that do have knowledge of the dynamics.",0
"Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for understanding how agents make decisions in complex, uncertain environments. However, traditional IRL algorithms assume that both the agent's decision process and the environmental dynamics are known and deterministic. This can limit their applicability in real-world settings where uncertainty and ambiguity abound. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called ""Probabilistic Inverse Reinforcement Learning"" (PIRL), which extends standard IRL methods to accommodate probabilistic models of decision-making and environmental dynamics. Our method uses Bayesian inference to estimate the probability distribution over latent variables representing the agent's objectives, policy, and transition model parameters, given observed behavior and feedback signals from the environment. We evaluate PIRL using simulated robot navigation tasks with stochastic sensor noise and imperfect state representation, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover meaningful objective functions and optimal policies even under conditions of significant uncertainty. These results suggest promising applications of our framework in domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and education, where robustness and adaptivity to changing and uncertain environments are critical requirements.",1
"This paper introduces a simple, general framework for likelihood-free Bayesian reinforcement learning, through Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). The main advantage is that we only require a prior distribution on a class of simulators (generative models). This is useful in domains where an analytical probabilistic model of the underlying process is too complex to formulate, but where detailed simulation models are available. ABC-RL allows the use of any Bayesian reinforcement learning technique, even in this case. In addition, it can be seen as an extension of rollout algorithms to the case where we do not know what the correct model to draw rollouts from is. We experimentally demonstrate the potential of this approach in a comparison with LSPI. Finally, we introduce a theorem showing that ABC is a sound methodology in principle, even when non-sufficient statistics are used.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can learn from trial-and error through reinforcement learning (RL). RL refers to a type of machine learning algorithm that allows agents to improve their performance on a task by receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. One such model that has gained significant attention in the field is called ""Asymmetric Bellman Completion"" (ABC), which leverages ideas from Bellman completion combined with optimization techniques drawn from deep RL. This paper seeks to provide an overview of the ABC model and how it can be applied to a variety of problems, as well as explore some potential limitations and open questions surrounding its use. We begin by providing background on RL and discussing key concepts behind the ABC approach, before moving into examples of applications where the method could potentially yield promising results. By outlining these advantages and exploring areas ripe for future investigation, we aim to contribute to the broader discussion on using ABC models for solving complex real-world tasks.",1
