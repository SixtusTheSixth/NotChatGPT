"In this paper, we focus on the problem of unsupervised image-sentence matching. Existing research explores to utilize document-level structural information to sample positive and negative instances for model training. Although the approach achieves positive results, it introduces a sampling bias and fails to distinguish instances with high semantic similarity. To alleviate the bias, we propose a new sampling strategy to select additional intra-document image-sentence pairs as positive or negative samples. Furthermore, to recognize the complex pattern in intra-document samples, we propose a Transformer based model to capture fine-grained features and implicitly construct a graph for each document, where concepts in a document are introduced to bridge the representation learning of images and sentences in the context of a document. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach to alleviate the bias and learn well-aligned multimodal representations.",0

"Engineering simulations for analysis of structural and fluid systems require information of contacts between various 3-D surfaces of the geometry to accurately model the physics between them. In machine learning applications, 3-D surfaces are most suitably represented with point clouds or meshes and learning representations of interacting geometries form point-based representations is challenging. The objective of this work is to introduce a machine learning algorithm, ActivationNet, that can learn from point clouds or meshes of interacting 3-D surfaces and predict the quality of contact between these surfaces. The ActivationNet generates activation states from point-based representation of surfaces using a multi-dimensional binning approach. The activation states are further used to contact quality between surfaces using deep neural networks. The performance of our model is demonstrated using several experiments, including tests on interacting surfaces extracted from engineering geometries. In all the experiments presented in this paper, the contact quality predictions of ActivationNet agree well with the expectations.",0

"Estimating an individual's potential response to interventions from observational data is of high practical relevance for many domains, such as healthcare, public policy or economics. In this setting, it is often the case that combinations of interventions may be applied simultaneously, for example, multiple prescriptions in healthcare or different fiscal and monetary measures in economics. However, existing methods for counterfactual inference are limited to settings in which actions are not used simultaneously. Here, we present Neural Counterfactual Relation Estimation (NCoRE), a new method for learning counterfactual representations in the combination treatment setting that explicitly models cross-treatment interactions. NCoRE is based on a novel branched conditional neural representation that includes learnt treatment interaction modulators to infer the potential causal generative process underlying the combination of multiple treatments. Our experiments show that NCoRE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for counterfactual treatment effect estimation that do not account for the effects of combining multiple treatments across several synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world benchmarks.",0

"Deep supervised learning has achieved great success in the last decade. However, its deficiencies of dependence on manual labels and vulnerability to attacks have driven people to explore a better solution. As an alternative, self-supervised learning attracts many researchers for its soaring performance on representation learning in the last several years. Self-supervised representation learning leverages input data itself as supervision and benefits almost all types of downstream tasks. In this survey, we take a look into new self-supervised learning methods for representation in computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning. We comprehensively review the existing empirical methods and summarize them into three main categories according to their objectives: generative, contrastive, and generative-contrastive (adversarial). We further investigate related theoretical analysis work to provide deeper thoughts on how self-supervised learning works. Finally, we briefly discuss open problems and future directions for self-supervised learning. An outline slide for the survey is provided.",0

"We present Self-Classifier -- a novel self-supervised end-to-end classification neural network. Self-Classifier learns labels and representations simultaneously in a single-stage end-to-end manner by optimizing for same-class prediction of two augmented views of the same sample. To guarantee non-degenerate solutions (i.e., solutions where all labels are assigned to the same class), a uniform prior is asserted on the labels. We show mathematically that unlike the regular cross-entropy loss, our approach avoids such solutions. Self-Classifier is simple to implement and is scalable to practically unlimited amounts of data. Unlike other unsupervised classification approaches, it does not require any form of pre-training or the use of expectation maximization algorithms, pseudo-labelling or external clustering. Unlike other contrastive learning representation learning approaches, it does not require a memory bank or a second network. Despite its relative simplicity, our approach achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art performance with ImageNet, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 for its two objectives: unsupervised classification and unsupervised representation learning. Furthermore, it is the first unsupervised end-to-end classification network to perform well on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. Code will be made available.",0

"Momentum Contrast (MoCo) achieves great success for unsupervised visual representation. However, there are a lot of supervised and semi-supervised datasets, which are already labeled. To fully utilize the label annotations, we propose Unified Momentum Contrast (UniMoCo), which extends MoCo to support arbitrary ratios of labeled data and unlabeled data training. Compared with MoCo, UniMoCo has two modifications as follows: (1) Different from a single positive pair in MoCo, we maintain multiple positive pairs on-the-fly by comparing the query label to a label queue. (2) We propose a Unified Contrastive(UniCon) loss to support an arbitrary number of positives and negatives in a unified pair-wise optimization perspective. Our UniCon is more reasonable and powerful than the supervised contrastive loss in theory and practice.

"We make two theoretical contributions to disentanglement learning by (a) defining precise semantics of disentangled representations, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluation. First, we characterize the concept ""disentangled representations"" used in supervised and unsupervised methods along three dimensions-informativeness, separability and interpretability - which can be expressed and quantified explicitly using information-theoretic constructs. This helps explain the behaviors of several well-known disentanglement learning models. We then propose robust metrics for measuring informativeness, separability and interpretability. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments, we show that our metrics correctly characterize the representations learned by different methods and are consistent with qualitative (visual) results. Thus, the metrics allow disentanglement learning methods to be compared on a fair ground. We also empirically uncovered new interesting properties of VAE-based methods and interpreted them with our formulation. These findings are promising and hopefully will encourage the design of more theoretically driven models for learning disentangled representations.",0

"Learning 3D representations that generalize well to arbitrarily oriented inputs is a challenge of practical importance in applications varying from computer vision to physics and chemistry. We propose a novel multi-resolution convolutional architecture for learning over concentric spherical feature maps, of which the single sphere representation is a special case. Our hierarchical architecture is based on alternatively learning to incorporate both intra-sphere and inter-sphere information. We show the applicability of our method for two different types of 3D inputs, mesh objects, which can be regularly sampled, and point clouds, which are irregularly distributed. We also propose an efficient mapping of point clouds to concentric spherical images, thereby bridging spherical convolutions on grids with general point clouds.

"Reinforcement learning methods trained on few environments rarely learn policies that generalize to unseen environments. To improve generalization, we incorporate the inherent sequential structure in reinforcement learning into the representation learning process. This approach is orthogonal to recent approaches, which rarely exploit this structure explicitly. Specifically, we introduce a theoretically motivated policy similarity metric (PSM) for measuring behavioral similarity between states. PSM assigns high similarity to states for which the optimal policies in those states as well as in future states are similar. We also present a contrastive representation learning procedure to embed any state similarity metric, which we instantiate with PSM to obtain policy similarity embeddings (PSEs). We demonstrate that PSEs improve generalization on diverse benchmarks, including LQR with spurious correlations, a jumping task from pixels, and Distracting DM Control Suite.",0

"The quality of the image representations obtained from self-supervised learning depends strongly on the type of data augmentations used in the learning formulation. Recent papers have ported these methods from still images to videos and found that leveraging both audio and video signals yields strong gains; however, they did not find that spatial augmentations such as cropping, which are very important for still images, work as well for videos. In this paper, we improve these formulations in two ways unique to the spatio-temporal aspect of videos. First, for space, we show that spatial augmentations such as cropping do work well for videos too, but that previous implementations, due to the high processing and memory cost, could not do this at a scale sufficient for it to work well. To address this issue, we first introduce Feature Crop, a method to simulate such augmentations much more efficiently directly in feature space. Second, we show that as opposed to naive average pooling, the use of transformer-based attention improves performance significantly, and is well suited for processing feature crops. Combining both of our discoveries into a new method, Space-time Crop & Attend (STiCA) we achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple video-representation learning benchmarks. In particular, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracies of 67.0% on HMDB-51 and 93.1% on UCF-101 when pre-training on Kinetics-400.",0

This research aims to enhance these methods specifically for spatio-temporal aspects of videos. Firstly, we demonstrate that spatial augmentations, such as cropping, can also be useful for videos, but their previous applications were not efficient enough to function well at scale. Therefore, we introduce Feature Crop, a technique that can simulate these augmentations more efficiently in feature space.

"Deep neural networks trained with standard cross-entropy loss memorize noisy labels, which degrades their performance. Most research to mitigate this memorization proposes new robust classification loss functions. Conversely, we propose a Multi-Objective Interpolation Training (MOIT) approach that jointly exploits contrastive learning and classification to mutually help each other and boost performance against label noise. We show that standard supervised contrastive learning degrades in the presence of label noise and propose an interpolation training strategy to mitigate this behavior. We further propose a novel label noise detection method that exploits the robust feature representations learned via contrastive learning to estimate per-sample soft-labels whose disagreements with the original labels accurately identify noisy samples. This detection allows treating noisy samples as unlabeled and training a classifier in a semi-supervised manner to prevent noise memorization and improve representation learning. We further propose MOIT+, a refinement of MOIT by fine-tuning on detected clean samples. Hyperparameter and ablation studies verify the key components of our method.

"Contrastive representation learning has shown to be effective to learn representations from unlabeled data.

Then, data instances are mixed in both the input and virtual label spaces, providing more augmented data during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that i-Mix consistently improves the quality of learned representations across domains, including image, speech, and tabular data.

"Recent works in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are actively revisiting various data augmentation techniques as an effective way to prevent discriminator overfitting. It is still unclear, however, that which augmentations could actually improve GANs, and in particular, how to apply a wider range of augmentations in training. In this paper, we propose a novel way to address these questions by incorporating a recent contrastive representation learning scheme into the GAN discriminator, coined ContraD. This ""fusion"" enables the discriminators to work with much stronger augmentations without increasing their training instability, thereby preventing the discriminator overfitting issue in GANs more effectively. Even better, we observe that the contrastive learning itself also benefits from our GAN training, i.e., by maintaining discriminative features between real and fake samples, suggesting a strong coherence between the two worlds: good contrastive representations are also good for GAN discriminators, and vice versa. Our experimental results show that GANs with ContraD consistently improve FID and IS compared to other recent techniques incorporating data augmentations, still maintaining highly discriminative features in the discriminator in terms of the linear evaluation. Finally, as a byproduct, we also show that our GANs trained in an unsupervised manner (without labels) can induce many conditional generative models via a simple latent sampling, leveraging the learned features of ContraD.

"A standard pipeline of current face recognition frameworks consists of four individual steps: locating a face with a rough bounding box and several fiducial landmarks, aligning the face image using a pre-defined template, extracting representations and comparing. Among them, face detection, landmark detection and representation learning have long been studied and a lot of works have been proposed. As an essential step with a significant impact on recognition performance, the alignment step has attracted little attention. In this paper, we first explore and highlight the effects of different alignment templates on face recognition. Then, for the first time, we try to search for the optimal template automatically. We construct a well-defined searching space by decomposing the template searching into the crop size and vertical shift, and propose an efficient method Face Alignment Policy Search (FAPS). Besides, a well-designed benchmark is proposed to evaluate the searched policy. Experiments on our proposed benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method to improve face recognition performance.",0

"We construct an unsupervised learning model that achieves nonlinear disentanglement of underlying factors of variation in naturalistic videos. Previous work suggests that representations can be disentangled if all but a few factors in the environment stay constant at any point in time. As a result, algorithms proposed for this problem have only been tested on carefully constructed datasets with this exact property, leaving it unclear whether they will transfer to natural scenes. Here we provide evidence that objects in segmented natural movies undergo transitions that are typically small in magnitude with occasional large jumps, which is characteristic of a temporally sparse distribution. We leverage this finding and present SlowVAE, a model for unsupervised representation learning that uses a sparse prior on temporally adjacent observations to disentangle generative factors without any assumptions on the number of changing factors. We provide a proof of identifiability and show that the model reliably learns disentangled representations on several established benchmark datasets, often surpassing the current state-of-the-art. We additionally demonstrate transferability towards video datasets with natural dynamics, Natural Sprites and KITTI Masks, which we contribute as benchmarks for guiding disentanglement research towards more natural data domains.",0

"The promising performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in text classification, has attracted researchers to use them for fraud review detection. However, the lack of trusted labeled data has limited the performance of the current solutions in detecting fraud reviews. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as a semi-supervised method has demonstrated to be effective for data augmentation purposes. The state-of-the-art solutions utilize GANs to overcome the data scarcity problem. However, they fail to incorporate the behavioral clues in fraud generation. Additionally, state-of-the-art approaches overlook the possible bot-generated reviews in the dataset. Finally, they also suffer from a common limitation in scalability and stability of the GAN, slowing down the training procedure. In this work, we propose ScoreGAN for fraud review detection that makes use of both review text and review rating scores in the generation and detection process. Scores are incorporated through Information Gain Maximization (IGM) into the loss function for three reasons. One is to generate score-correlated reviews based on the scores given to the generator. Second, the generated reviews are employed to train the discriminator, so the discriminator can correctly label the possible bot-generated reviews through joint representations learned from the concatenation of GLobal Vector for Word representation (GLoVe) extracted from the text and the score. Finally, it can be used to improve the stability and scalability of the GAN. Results show that the proposed framework outperformed the existing state-of-the-art framework, namely FakeGAN, in terms of AP by 7\%, and 5\% on the Yelp and TripAdvisor datasets, respectively.",0

"Deeply-learned planning methods are often based on learning representations that are optimized for unrelated tasks. For example, they might be trained on reconstructing the environment. These representations are then combined with predictor functions for simulating rollouts to navigate the environment. We find this principle of learning representations unsatisfying and propose to learn them such that they are directly optimized for the task at hand: to be maximally predictable for the predictor function. This results in representations that are by design optimal for the downstream task of planning, where the learned predictor function is used as a forward model.   To this end, we propose a new way of jointly learning this representation along with the prediction function, a system we dub Latent Representation Prediction Network (LARP). The prediction function is used as a forward model for search on a graph in a viewpoint-matching task and the representation learned to maximize predictability is found to outperform a pre-trained representation. Our approach is shown to be more sample-efficient than standard reinforcement learning methods and our learned representation transfers successfully to dissimilar objects.",0

This leads to representations that are ideal for the downstream planning task, where the learned predictor function acts as a forward model. We propose a new way of jointly learning the representation and prediction function, which is called the Latent Representation Prediction Network (LARP). In a viewpoint-matching task, the prediction function is used as a forward model for search on a graph, and the representation learned to maximize predictability is found to perform better than a pre-trained representation. Our approach is more efficient in terms of sample size than standard reinforcement learning methods, and our learned representation transfers successfully to dissimilar objects.",1
"Practitioners in diverse fields such as healthcare, economics and education are eager to apply machine learning to improve decision making. The cost and impracticality of performing experiments and a recent monumental increase in electronic record keeping has brought attention to the problem of evaluating decisions based on non-experimental observational data. This is the setting of this work. In particular, we study estimation of individual-level causal effects, such as a single patient's response to alternative medication, from recorded contexts, decisions and outcomes. We give generalization bounds on the error in estimated effects based on distance measures between groups receiving different treatments, allowing for sample re-weighting. We provide conditions under which our bound is tight and show how it relates to results for unsupervised domain adaptation. Led by our theoretical results, we devise representation learning algorithms that minimize our bound, by regularizing the representation's induced treatment group distance, and encourage sharing of information between treatment groups. We extend these algorithms to simultaneously learn a weighted representation to further reduce treatment group distances. Finally, an experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data shows the value of our proposed representation architecture and regularization scheme.",0

"Attempt to fully discover the temporal diversity and chronological characteristics for self-supervised video representation learning, this work takes advantage of the temporal dependencies within videos and further proposes a novel self-supervised method named Temporal Contrastive Graph Learning (TCGL). In contrast to the existing methods that ignore modeling elaborate temporal dependencies, our TCGL roots in a hybrid graph contrastive learning strategy to jointly regard the inter-snippet and intra-snippet temporal dependencies as self-supervision signals for temporal representation learning. To model multi-scale temporal dependencies, our TCGL integrates the prior knowledge about the frame and snippet orders into graph structures, i.e., the intra-/inter- snippet temporal contrastive graphs. By randomly removing edges and masking nodes of the intra-snippet graphs or inter-snippet graphs, our TCGL can generate different correlated graph views. Then, specific contrastive learning modules are designed to maximize the agreement between nodes in different views. To adaptively learn the global context representation and recalibrate the channel-wise features, we introduce an adaptive video snippet order prediction module, which leverages the relational knowledge among video snippets to predict the actual snippet orders. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TCGL over the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval benchmarks.",0

"MoCo is effective for unsupervised image representation learning. In this paper, we propose VideoMoCo for unsupervised video representation learning. Given a video sequence as an input sample, we improve the temporal feature representations of MoCo from two perspectives. First, we introduce a generator to drop out several frames from this sample temporally. The discriminator is then learned to encode similar feature representations regardless of frame removals. By adaptively dropping out different frames during training iterations of adversarial learning, we augment this input sample to train a temporally robust encoder. Second, we use temporal decay to model key attenuation in the memory queue when computing the contrastive loss. As the momentum encoder updates after keys enqueue, the representation ability of these keys degrades when we use the current input sample for contrastive learning. This degradation is reflected via temporal decay to attend the input sample to recent keys in the queue. As a result, we adapt MoCo to learn video representations without empirically designing pretext tasks. By empowering the temporal robustness of the encoder and modeling the temporal decay of the keys, our VideoMoCo improves MoCo temporally based on contrastive learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets including UCF101 and HMDB51 show that VideoMoCo stands as a state-of-the-art video representation learning method.",0

"This paper presents SPICE, a Semantic Pseudo-labeling framework for Image ClustEring. Instead of using indirect loss functions required by the recently proposed methods, SPICE generates pseudo-labels via self-learning and directly uses the pseudo-label-based classification loss to train a deep clustering network. The basic idea of SPICE is to synergize the discrepancy among semantic clusters, the similarity among instance samples, and the semantic consistency of local samples in an embedding space to optimize the clustering network in a semantically-driven paradigm. Specifically, a semantic-similarity-based pseudo-labeling algorithm is first proposed to train a clustering network through unsupervised representation learning. Given the initial clustering results, a local semantic consistency principle is used to select a set of reliably labeled samples, and a semi-pseudo-labeling algorithm is adapted for performance boosting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPICE clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on six common benchmark datasets including STL10, Cifar10, Cifar100-20, ImageNet-10, ImageNet-Dog, and Tiny-ImageNet. On average, our SPICE method improves the current best results by about 10% in terms of adjusted rand index, normalized mutual information, and clustering accuracy.",0

"Successor-style representations have many advantages for reinforcement learning: for example, they can help an agent generalize from past experience to new goals, and they have been proposed as explanations of behavioral and neural data from human and animal learners. They also form a natural bridge between model-based and model-free RL methods: like the former they make predictions about future experiences, and like the latter they allow efficient prediction of total discounted rewards. However, successor-style representations are not optimized to generalize across policies: typically, we maintain a limited-length list of policies, and share information among them by representation learning or GPI. Successor-style representations also typically make no provision for gathering information or reasoning about latent variables. To address these limitations, we bring together ideas from predictive state representations, belief space value iteration, successor features, and convex analysis: we develop a new, general successor-style representation, together with a Bellman equation that connects multiple sources of information within this representation, including different latent states, policies, and reward functions. The new representation is highly expressive: for example, it lets us efficiently read off an optimal policy for a new reward function, or a policy that imitates a new demonstration. For this paper, we focus on exact computation of the new representation in small, known environments, since even this restricted setting offers plenty of interesting questions. Our implementation does not scale to large, unknown environments -- nor would we expect it to, since it generalizes POMDP value iteration, which is difficult to scale. However, we believe that future work will allow us to extend our ideas to approximate reasoning in large, unknown environments.",0

"In this work, we propose a new generative model that is capable of automatically decoupling global and local representations of images in an entirely unsupervised setting, by embedding a generative flow in the VAE framework to model the decoder. Specifically, the proposed model utilizes the variational auto-encoding framework to learn a (low-dimensional) vector of latent variables to capture the global information of an image, which is fed as a conditional input to a flow-based invertible decoder with architecture borrowed from style transfer literature. Experimental results on standard image benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in terms of density estimation, image generation and unsupervised representation learning.

"We study unsupervised video representation learning that seeks to learn both motion and appearance features from unlabeled video only, which can be reused for downstream tasks such as action recognition. This task, however, is extremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex spatial-temporal information in videos; and 2) the lack of labeled data for training. Unlike the representation learning for static images, it is difficult to construct a suitable self-supervised task to well model both motion and appearance features. More recently, several attempts have been made to learn video representation through video playback speed prediction. However, it is non-trivial to obtain precise speed labels for the videos. More critically, the learnt models may tend to focus on motion pattern and thus may not learn appearance features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback speed is more consistent with motion pattern, and thus provide more effective and stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore, we propose a new way to perceive the playback speed and exploit the relative speed between two video clips as labels. In this way, we are able to well perceive speed and learn better motion features. Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance features, we further propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the model to perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show that optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance on two downstream tasks, namely action recognition and video retrieval. Remarkably, for action recognition on UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7% accuracy without the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the ImageNet supervised pre-trained model.

"Developing an agent in reinforcement learning (RL) that is capable of performing complex control tasks directly from high-dimensional observation such as raw pixels is yet a challenge as efforts are made towards improving sample efficiency and generalization.

"Deep learning methods have made significant progress in ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The pretraining technique is usually adopted to support deep neural networks-based SAR ship detectors due to the scarce labeled SAR images. However, directly leveraging ImageNet pretraining is hardly to obtain a good ship detector because of different imaging perspective and geometry. In this paper, to resolve the problem of inconsistent imaging perspective between ImageNet and earth observations, we propose an optical ship detector (OSD) pretraining technique, which transfers the characteristics of ships in earth observations to SAR images from a large-scale aerial image dataset. On the other hand, to handle the problem of different imaging geometry between optical and SAR images, we propose an optical-SAR matching (OSM) pretraining technique, which transfers plentiful texture features from optical images to SAR images by common representation learning on the optical-SAR matching task. Finally, observing that the OSD pretraining based SAR ship detector has a better recall on sea area while the OSM pretraining based SAR ship detector can reduce false alarms on land area, we combine the predictions of the two detectors through weighted boxes fusion to further improve detection results. Extensive experiments on four SAR ship detection datasets and two representative CNN-based detection benchmarks are conducted to show the effectiveness and complementarity of the two proposed detectors, and the state-of-the-art performance of the combination of the two detectors.

"Few-shot image classification consists of two consecutive learning processes: 1) In the meta-learning stage, the model acquires a knowledge base from a set of training classes. 2) During meta-testing, the acquired knowledge is used to recognize unseen classes from very few examples. Inspired by the compositional representation of objects in humans, we train a neural network architecture that explicitly represents objects as a set of parts and their spatial composition. In particular, during meta-learning, we train a knowledge base that consists of a dictionary of part representations and a dictionary of part activation maps that encode common spatial activation patterns of parts. The elements of both dictionaries are shared among the training classes. During meta-testing, the representation of unseen classes is learned using the part representations and the part activation maps from the knowledge base.

"The embedding-based representation learning is commonly used in deep learning recommendation models to map the raw sparse features to dense vectors. The traditional embedding manner that assigns a uniform size to all features has two issues. First, the numerous features inevitably lead to a gigantic embedding table that causes a high memory usage cost. Second, it is likely to cause the over-fitting problem for those features that do not require too large representation capacity. Existing works that try to address the problem always cause a significant drop in recommendation performance or suffers from the limitation of unaffordable training time cost. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, named PEP (short for Plug-in Embedding Pruning), to reduce the size of the embedding table while avoiding the drop of recommendation accuracy. PEP prunes embedding parameter where the pruning threshold(s) can be adaptively learned from data. Therefore we can automatically obtain a mixed-dimension embedding-scheme by pruning redundant parameters for each feature. PEP is a general framework that can plug in various base recommendation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate it can efficiently cut down embedding parameters and boost the base model's performance. Specifically, it achieves strong recommendation performance while reducing 97-99% parameters. As for the computation cost, PEP only brings an additional 20-30% time cost compared with base models.

"Real-world data usually have high dimensionality and it is important to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. High-dimensional data are usually in a coherent structure and make the data in relatively small true degrees of freedom. There are global and local dimensionality reduction methods to alleviate the problem. Most of existing methods for local dimensionality reduction obtain an embedding with the eigenvalue or singular value decomposition, where the computational complexities are very high for a large amount of data. Here we propose a novel local nonlinear approach named Vec2vec for general purpose dimensionality reduction, which generalizes recent advancements in embedding representation learning of words to dimensionality reduction of matrices. It obtains the nonlinear embedding using a neural network with only one hidden layer to reduce the computational complexity. To train the neural network, we build the neighborhood similarity graph of a matrix and define the context of data points by exploiting the random walk properties. Experiments demenstrate that Vec2vec is more efficient than several state-of-the-art local dimensionality reduction methods in a large number of high-dimensional data. Extensive experiments of data classification and clustering on eight real datasets show that Vec2vec is better than several classical dimensionality reduction methods in the statistical hypothesis test, and it is competitive with recently developed state-of-the-art UMAP.",0

On the ImageNet database, our ResNet-200 model yields a top-1 accuracy of 81.4%, which is 0.8% higher than the best recorded performance for this architecture. Furthermore, our method consistently outperforms cross-entropy on other datasets and two ResNet models, while also providing advantages in terms of natural corruption robustness and hyperparameter stability. Our loss function is straightforward to implement, and TensorFlow code is available at https://t.ly/supcon.",1
"Semantically meaningful information content in perceptual signals is usually unevenly distributed. In speech signals for example, there are often many silences, and the speed of pronunciation can vary considerably. In this work, we propose slow autoencoders (SlowAEs) for unsupervised learning of high-level variable-rate discrete representations of sequences, and apply them to speech. We show that the resulting event-based representations automatically grow or shrink depending on the density of salient information in the input signals, while still allowing for faithful signal reconstruction. We develop run-length Transformers (RLTs) for event-based representation modelling and use them to construct language models in the speech domain, which are able to generate grammatical and semantically coherent utterances and continuations.",0

"Recent studies on computer vision mainly focus on natural images that express real-world scenes. They achieve outstanding performance on diverse tasks such as visual question answering. Diagram is a special form of visual expression that frequently appears in the education field and is of great significance for learners to understand multimodal knowledge. Current research on diagrams preliminarily focuses on natural disciplines such as Biology and Geography, whose expressions are still similar to natural images. Another type of diagrams such as from Computer Science is composed of graphics containing complex topologies and relations, and research on this type of diagrams is still blank. The main challenges of graphic diagrams understanding are the rarity of data and the confusion of semantics, which are mainly reflected in the diversity of expressions. In this paper, we construct a novel dataset of graphic diagrams named Computer Science Diagrams (CSDia). It contains more than 1,200 diagrams and exhaustive annotations of objects and relations. Considering the visual noises caused by the various expressions in diagrams, we introduce the topology of diagrams to parse topological structure. After that, we propose Diagram Parsing Net (DPN) to represent the diagram from three branches: topology, visual feature, and text, and apply the model to the diagram classification task to evaluate the ability of diagrams understanding. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed DPN on diagrams understanding.",0

"In comparison to classical shallow representation learning techniques, deep neural networks have achieved superior performance in nearly every application benchmark. But despite their clear empirical advantages, it is still not well understood what makes them so effective. To approach this question, we introduce deep frame approximation, a unifying framework for representation learning with structured overcomplete frames. While exact inference requires iterative optimization, it may be approximated by the operations of a feed-forward deep neural network. We then indirectly analyze how model capacity relates to the frame structure induced by architectural hyperparameters such as depth, width, and skip connections. We quantify these structural differences with the deep frame potential, a data-independent measure of coherence linked to representation uniqueness and stability. As a criterion for model selection, we show correlation with generalization error on a variety of common deep network architectures such as ResNets and DenseNets. We also demonstrate how recurrent networks implementing iterative optimization algorithms achieve performance comparable to their feed-forward approximations. This connection to the established theory of overcomplete representations suggests promising new directions for principled deep network architecture design with less reliance on ad-hoc engineering.",0

"Contrastive learning is a key technique of modern self-supervised learning. The broader accessibility of earlier approaches is hindered by the need of heavy computational resources (e.g., at least 8 GPUs or 32 TPU cores), which accommodate for large-scale negative samples or momentum. The more recent SimSiam approach addresses such key limitations via stop-gradient without momentum encoders. In medical image analysis, multiple instances can be achieved from the same patient or tissue. Inspired by these advances, we propose a simple triplet representation learning (SimTriplet) approach on pathological images. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: (1) The proposed SimTriplet method takes advantage of the multi-view nature of medical images beyond self-augmentation; (2) The method maximizes both intra-sample and inter-sample similarities via triplets from positive pairs, without using negative samples; and (3) The recent mix precision training is employed to advance the training by only using a single GPU with 16GB memory. By learning from 79,000 unlabeled pathological patch images, SimTriplet achieved 10.58% better performance compared with supervised learning. It also achieved 2.13% better performance compared with SimSiam. Our proposed SimTriplet can achieve decent performance using only 1% labeled data.

"Contrastive learning methods for unsupervised visual representation learning have reached remarkable levels of transfer performance. We argue that the power of contrastive learning has yet to be fully unleashed, as current methods are trained only on instance-level pretext tasks, leading to representations that may be sub-optimal for downstream tasks requiring dense pixel predictions. In this paper, we introduce pixel-level pretext tasks for learning dense feature representations. The first task directly applies contrastive learning at the pixel level. We additionally propose a pixel-to-propagation consistency task that produces better results, even surpassing the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Specifically, it achieves 60.2 AP, 41.4 / 40.5 mAP and 77.2 mIoU when transferred to Pascal VOC object detection (C4), COCO object detection (FPN / C4) and Cityscapes semantic segmentation using a ResNet-50 backbone network, which are 2.6 AP, 0.8 / 1.0 mAP and 1.0 mIoU better than the previous best methods built on instance-level contrastive learning. Moreover, the pixel-level pretext tasks are found to be effective for pre-training not only regular backbone networks but also head networks used for dense downstream tasks, and are complementary to instance-level contrastive methods. These results demonstrate the strong potential of defining pretext tasks at the pixel level, and suggest a new path forward in unsupervised visual representation learning.

"Visual Attention Prediction (VAP) is a significant and imperative issue in the field of computer vision. Most of existing VAP methods are based on deep learning. However, they do not fully take advantage of the low-level contrast features while generating the visual attention map. In this paper, a novel VAP method is proposed to generate visual attention map via bio-inspired representation learning. The bio-inspired representation learning combines both low-level contrast and high-level semantic features simultaneously, which are developed by the fact that human eye is sensitive to the patches with high contrast and objects with high semantics. The proposed method is composed of three main steps: 1) feature extraction, 2) bio-inspired representation learning and 3) visual attention map generation. Firstly, the high-level semantic feature is extracted from the refined VGG16, while the low-level contrast feature is extracted by the proposed contrast feature extraction block in a deep network. Secondly, during bio-inspired representation learning, both the extracted low-level contrast and high-level semantic features are combined by the designed densely connected block, which is proposed to concatenate various features scale by scale. Finally, the weighted-fusion layer is exploited to generate the ultimate visual attention map based on the obtained representations after bio-inspired representation learning.

"Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a central task in knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning. There is vast literature on efficient algorithms for constructing data structures and performing exact and approximate NNS. This paper studies NNS under Uncertainty (NNSU). Specifically, consider the setting in which an NNS algorithm has access only to a stochastic distance oracle that provides a noisy, unbiased estimate of the distance between any pair of points, rather than the exact distance. This models many situations of practical importance, including NNS based on human similarity judgements, physical measurements, or fast, randomized approximations to exact distances. A naive approach to NNSU could employ any standard NNS algorithm and repeatedly query and average results from the stochastic oracle (to reduce noise) whenever it needs a pairwise distance. The problem is that a sufficient number of repeated queries is unknown in advance; e.g., a point maybe distant from all but one other point (crude distance estimates suffice) or it may be close to a large number of other points (accurate estimates are necessary). This paper shows how ideas from cover trees and multi-armed bandits can be leveraged to develop an NNSU algorithm that has optimal dependence on the dataset size and the (unknown)geometry of the dataset.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning achieves promising performances in pre-training representations for object detectors. However, previous approaches are mainly designed for image-level classification, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To bridge the performance gap, this work proposes a simple yet effective representation learning method for object detection, named patch re-identification (Re-ID), which can be treated as a contrastive pretext task to learn location-discriminative representation unsupervisedly, possessing appealing advantages compared to its counterparts. Firstly, unlike fully-supervised person Re-ID that matches a human identity in different camera views, patch Re-ID treats an important patch as a pseudo identity and contrastively learns its correspondence in two different image views, where the pseudo identity has different translations and transformations, enabling to learn discriminative features for object detection. Secondly, patch Re-ID is performed in Deeply Unsupervised manner to learn multi-level representations, appealing to object detection. Thirdly, extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms its counterparts on COCO in all settings, such as different training iterations and data percentages. For example, Mask R-CNN initialized with our representation surpasses MoCo v2 and even its fully-supervised counterparts in all setups of training iterations (e.g. 2.1 and 1.1 mAP improvement compared to MoCo v2 in 12k and 90k iterations respectively).

"We propose PermaKey, a novel approach to representation learning based on object keypoints. It leverages the predictability of local image regions from spatial neighborhoods to identify salient regions that correspond to object parts, which are then converted to keypoints. Unlike prior approaches, it utilizes predictability to discover object keypoints, an intrinsic property of objects. This ensures that it does not overly bias keypoints to focus on characteristics that are not unique to objects, such as movement, shape, colour etc. We demonstrate the efficacy of PermaKey on Atari where it learns keypoints corresponding to the most salient object parts and is robust to certain visual distractors. Further, on downstream RL tasks in the Atari domain we demonstrate how agents equipped with our keypoints outperform those using competing alternatives, even on challenging environments with moving backgrounds or distractor objects.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various real-world applications due to their strong ability in graph representation learning. GNNs explore the graph structure and node features by aggregating and transforming information within node neighborhoods.

"To address the challenging task of instance-aware human part parsing, a new bottom-up regime is proposed to learn category-level human semantic segmentation as well as multi-person pose estimation in a joint and end-to-end manner. It is a compact, efficient and powerful framework that exploits structural information over different human granularities and eases the difficulty of person partitioning. Specifically, a dense-to-sparse projection field, which allows explicitly associating dense human semantics with sparse keypoints, is learnt and progressively improved over the network feature pyramid for robustness. Then, the difficult pixel grouping problem is cast as an easier, multi-person joint assembling task. By formulating joint association as maximum-weight bipartite matching, a differentiable solution is developed to exploit projected gradient descent and Dykstra's cyclic projection algorithm. This makes our method end-to-end trainable and allows back-propagating the grouping error to directly supervise multi-granularity human representation learning. This is distinguished from current bottom-up human parsers or pose estimators which require sophisticated post-processing or heuristic greedy algorithms.

We implemented the inference rules within the neural network, enabling end-to-end learning of the probabilistic and CNN front-end parameters. Our empirical evaluation on six large-scale datasets for dense visual prediction demonstrates that VISTA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art in various continuous and discrete prediction tasks, confirming the efficacy of our approach in joint structured spatial-channel attention estimation for deep representation learning. The code for VISTA-Net is available at https://github.com/ygjwd12345/VISTA-Net.",1
"Learning reliable motion representation between consecutive frames, such as optical flow, has proven to have great promotion to video understanding. However, the TV-L1 method, an effective optical flow solver, is time-consuming and expensive in storage for caching the extracted optical flow. To fill the gap, we propose UF-TSN, a novel end-to-end action recognition approach enhanced with an embedded lightweight unsupervised optical flow estimator. UF-TSN estimates motion cues from adjacent frames in a coarse-to-fine manner and focuses on small displacement for each level by extracting pyramid of feature and warping one to the other according to the estimated flow of the last level. Due to the lack of labeled motion for action datasets, we constrain the flow prediction with multi-scale photometric consistency and edge-aware smoothness. Compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised motion representation learning methods, our model achieves better accuracy while maintaining efficiency, which is competitive with some supervised or more complicated approaches.",0

"Person re-identification (ReID) aims at searching the same identity person among images captured by various cameras. Unsupervised person ReID attracts a lot of attention recently, due to it works without intensive manual annotation and thus shows great potential of adapting to new conditions. Representation learning plays a critical role in unsupervised person ReID. In this work, we propose a novel selective contrastive learning framework for unsupervised feature learning. Specifically, different from traditional contrastive learning strategies, we propose to use multiple positives and adaptively sampled negatives for defining the contrastive loss, enabling to learn a feature embedding model with stronger identity discriminative representation. Moreover, we propose to jointly leverage global and local features to construct three dynamic dictionaries, among which the global and local memory banks are used for pairwise similarity computation and the mixture memory bank are used for contrastive loss definition. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in unsupervised person ReID compared with the state-of-the-arts.",0

"Whilst contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success in self-supervised representation learning, its potential for deep clustering remains unknown. This is due to its fundamental limitation that the instance discrimination strategy it takes is not class sensitive and hence unable to reason about the underlying decision boundaries between semantic concepts or classes. In this work, we solve this problem by introducing a novel variant called Semantic Contrastive Learning (SCL). It explores the characteristics of both conventional contrastive learning and deep clustering by imposing distance-based cluster structures on unlabelled training data and also introducing a discriminative contrastive loss formulation. For explicitly modelling class boundaries on-the-fly, we further formulate a clustering consistency condition on the two different predictions given by visual similarities and semantic decision boundaries. By advancing implicit representation learning towards explicit understandings of visual semantics, SCL can amplify jointly the strengths of contrastive learning and deep clustering in a unified approach. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods on six challenging object recognition benchmarks, especially on finer-grained and larger datasets.",0

"The milestone improvements brought about by deep representation learning and pre-training techniques have led to large performance gains across downstream NLP, IR and Vision tasks. Multimodal modeling techniques aim to leverage large high-quality visio-linguistic datasets for learning complementary information (across image and text modalities). In this paper, we introduce the Wikipedia-based Image Text (WIT) Dataset (https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit) to better facilitate multimodal, multilingual learning. WIT is composed of a curated set of 37.6 million entity rich image-text examples with 11.5 million unique images across 108 Wikipedia languages. Its size enables WIT to be used as a pretraining dataset for multimodal models, as we show when applied to downstream tasks such as image-text retrieval. WIT has four main and unique advantages. First, WIT is the largest multimodal dataset by the number of image-text examples by 3x (at the time of writing). Second, WIT is massively multilingual (first of its kind) with coverage over 100+ languages (each of which has at least 12K examples) and provides cross-lingual texts for many images. Third, WIT represents a more diverse set of concepts and real world entities relative to what previous datasets cover.

"Balanced representation learning methods have been applied successfully to counterfactual inference from observational data. However, approaches that account for survival outcomes are relatively limited. Survival data are frequently encountered across diverse medical applications, i.e., drug development, risk profiling, and clinical trials, and such data are also relevant in fields like manufacturing (e.g., for equipment monitoring). When the outcome of interest is a time-to-event, special precautions for handling censored events need to be taken, as ignoring censored outcomes may lead to biased estimates. We propose a theoretically grounded unified framework for counterfactual inference applicable to survival outcomes. Further, we formulate a nonparametric hazard ratio metric for evaluating average and individualized treatment effects. Experimental results on real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, the latter of which we introduce, demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms competitive alternatives in both survival-outcome prediction and treatment-effect estimation.",0

"Most multilayer least squares (LS)-based neural networks are structured with two separate stages: unsupervised feature encoding and supervised pattern classification. Once the unsupervised learning is finished, the latent encoding would be fixed without supervised fine-tuning. However, in complex tasks such as handling the ImageNet dataset, there are often many more clues that can be directly encoded, while the unsupervised learning, by definition cannot know exactly what is useful for a certain task. This serves as the motivation to retrain the latent space representations to learn some clues that unsupervised learning has not yet learned. In particular, the error matrix from the output layer is pulled back to each hidden layer, and the parameters of the hidden layer are recalculated with Moore-Penrose (MP) inverse for more generalized representations. In this paper, a recomputation-based multilayer network using MP inverse (RML-MP) is developed. A sparse RML-MP (SRML-MP) model to boost the performance of RML-MP is then proposed. The experimental results with varying training samples (from 3 K to 1.8 M) show that the proposed models provide better generalization performance than most representation learning algorithms.",0

"Sequential matching using hand-crafted heuristics has been standard practice in route-based place recognition for enhancing pairwise similarity results for nearly a decade. However, precision-recall performance of these algorithms dramatically degrades when searching on short temporal window (TW) lengths, while demanding high compute and storage costs on large robotic datasets for autonomous navigation research. Here, influenced by biological systems that robustly navigate spacetime scales even without vision, we develop a joint visual and positional representation learning technique, via a sequential process, and design a learning-based CNN+LSTM architecture, trainable via backpropagation through time, for viewpoint- and appearance-invariant place recognition. Our approach, Sequential Place Learning (SPL), is based on a CNN function that visually encodes an environment from a single traversal, thus reducing storage capacity, while an LSTM temporally fuses each visual embedding with corresponding positional data -- obtained from any source of motion estimation -- for direct sequential inference. Contrary to classical two-stage pipelines, e.g., match-then-temporally-filter, our network directly eliminates false-positive rates while jointly learning sequence matching from a single monocular image sequence, even using short TWs. Hence, we demonstrate that our model outperforms 15 classical methods while setting new state-of-the-art performance standards on 4 challenging benchmark datasets, where one of them can be considered solved with recall rates of 100% at 100% precision, correctly matching all places under extreme sunlight-darkness changes.

"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art deep learning model for representation learning on graphs. However, it remains notoriously challenging to train and inference GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. This is because as the graph size grows, the sheer number of node features and the large adjacency matrix can easily explode the required memory and data movements. To tackle the aforementioned challenge, we explore the possibility of drawing lottery tickets when sparsifying GCN graphs, i.e., subgraphs that largely shrink the adjacency matrix yet are capable of achieving accuracy comparable to or even better than their corresponding full graphs. Specifically, we for the first time discover the existence of graph early-bird (GEB) tickets that emerge at the very early stage when sparsifying GCN graphs, and propose a simple yet effective detector to automatically identify the emergence of such GEB tickets. Furthermore, we develop a generic efficient GCN training framework dubbed GEBT that can significantly boost the efficiency of GCN training by (1) drawing joint early-bird tickets between the GCN graphs and models and (2) enabling simultaneously sparsifying both GCN graphs and models, paving the way for training and inferencing large GCN graphs to handle real-world graph datasets. Experiments on various GCN models and datasets consistently validate our GEB finding and the effectiveness of our GEBT, e.g., our GEBT achieves up to 80.2% ~ 85.6% and 84.6% ~ 87.5% savings of GCN training and inference costs while leading to a comparable or even better accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

"We propose Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components (DAPC) -- a self-supervised representation learning method for sequence data, based on the intuition that useful representations of sequence data should exhibit a simple structure in the latent space. We encourage this latent structure by maximizing an estimate of predictive information of latent feature sequences, which is the mutual information between past and future windows at each time step. In contrast to the mutual information lower bound commonly used by contrastive learning, the estimate of predictive information we adopt is exact under a Gaussian assumption. Additionally, it can be computed without negative sampling. To reduce the degeneracy of the latent space extracted by powerful encoders and keep useful information from the inputs, we regularize predictive information learning with a challenging masked reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that our method recovers the latent space of noisy dynamical systems, extracts predictive features for forecasting tasks, and improves automatic speech recognition when used to pretrain the encoder on large amounts of unlabeled data.",0

"We introduce a notion of usable information contained in the representation learned by a deep network, and use it to study how optimal representations for the task emerge during training. We show that the implicit regularization coming from training with Stochastic Gradient Descent with a high learning-rate and small batch size plays an important role in learning minimal sufficient representations for the task. In the process of arriving at a minimal sufficient representation, we find that the content of the representation changes dynamically during training. In particular, we find that semantically meaningful but ultimately irrelevant information is encoded in the early transient dynamics of training, before being later discarded. In addition, we evaluate how perturbing the initial part of training impacts the learning dynamics and the resulting representations.

However, due to the unsupervised nature, 2DCCA is incapable of extracting sufficient discriminatory representations, resulting in an unsatisfying performance. In this letter, we propose a complete discriminative tensor representation learning (CDTRL) method based on linear correlation analysis for analyzing 2D signals (e.g. images). This letter shows that the introduction of the complete discriminatory tensor representation strategy provides an effective vehicle for revealing, and extracting the discriminant representations across the 2D data sets, leading to improved results. Experimental results show that the proposed CDTRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the evaluated data sets.",0

"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) are currently the method of choice both for generative, as well as for discriminative learning in computer vision and machine learning. The success of DCNNs can be attributed to the careful selection of their building blocks (e.g., residual blocks, rectifiers, sophisticated normalization schemes, to mention but a few). In this paper, we propose $\Pi$-Nets, a new class of function approximators based on polynomial expansions. $\Pi$-Nets are polynomial neural networks, i.e., the output is a high-order polynomial of the input. The unknown parameters, which are naturally represented by high-order tensors, are estimated through a collective tensor factorization with factors sharing. We introduce three tensor decompositions that significantly reduce the number of parameters and show how they can be efficiently implemented by hierarchical neural networks. We empirically demonstrate that $\Pi$-Nets are very expressive and they even produce good results without the use of non-linear activation functions in a large battery of tasks and signals, i.e., images, graphs, and audio. When used in conjunction with activation functions, $\Pi$-Nets produce state-of-the-art results in three challenging tasks, i.e. image generation, face verification and 3D mesh representation learning.

"A complete representation of 3D objects requires characterizing the space of deformations in an interpretable manner, from articulations of a single instance to changes in shape across categories. In this work, we improve on a prior generative model of geometric disentanglement for 3D shapes, wherein the space of object geometry is factorized into rigid orientation, non-rigid pose, and intrinsic shape. The resulting model can be trained from raw 3D shapes, without correspondences, labels, or even rigid alignment, using a combination of classical spectral geometry and probabilistic disentanglement of a structured latent representation space. Our improvements include more sophisticated handling of rotational invariance and the use of a diffeomorphic flow network to bridge latent and spectral space. The geometric structuring of the latent space imparts an interpretable characterization of the deformation space of an object. Furthermore, it enables tasks like pose transfer and pose-aware retrieval without requiring supervision. We evaluate our model on its generative modelling, representation learning, and disentanglement performance, showing improved rotation invariance and intrinsic-extrinsic factorization quality over the prior model.",0

"Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a successful method for unsupervised graph representation learning. Most graph CL methods first perform stochastic augmentation on the input graph to obtain two graph views and maximize the agreement of representations in the two views. Despite the prosperous development of graph CL methods, the design of graph augmentation schemes -- a crucial component in CL -- remains rarely explored. We argue that the data augmentation schemes should preserve intrinsic structures and attributes of graphs, which will force the model to learn representations that are insensitive to perturbation on unimportant nodes and edges. However, most existing methods adopt uniform data augmentation schemes, like uniformly dropping edges and uniformly shuffling features, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive representation learning method with adaptive augmentation that incorporates various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph. Specifically, on the topology level, we design augmentation schemes based on node centrality measures to highlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we corrupt node features by adding more noise to unimportant node features, to enforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information. We perform extensive experiments of node classification on a variety of real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and even surpasses some supervised counterparts, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed contrastive framework with adaptive augmentation.",0

"Accurately identifying different representations of the same real-world entity is an integral part of data cleaning and many methods have been proposed to accomplish it. The challenges of this entity resolution task that demand so much research attention are often rooted in the task-specificity and user-dependence of the process. Adopting deep learning techniques has the potential to lessen these challenges.

"We consider representation learning from 3D graphs in which each node is associated with a spatial position in 3D. This is an under explored area of research, and a principled framework is currently lacking. In this work, we propose a generic framework, known as the 3D graph network (3DGN), to provide a unified interface at different levels of granularity for 3D graphs. Built on 3DGN, we propose the spherical message passing (SMP) as a novel and specific scheme for realizing the 3DGN framework in the spherical coordinate system (SCS). We conduct formal analyses and show that the relative location of each node in 3D graphs is uniquely defined in the SMP scheme. Thus, our SMP represents a complete and accurate architecture for learning from 3D graphs in the SCS. We derive physically-based representations of geometric information and propose the SphereNet for learning representations of 3D graphs.

"In supervised learning, smoothing label or prediction distribution in neural network training has been proven useful in preventing the model from being over-confident, and is crucial for learning more robust visual representations. This observation motivates us to explore ways to make predictions flattened in unsupervised learning. Considering that human-annotated labels are not adopted in unsupervised learning, we introduce a straightforward approach to perturb input image space in order to soften the output prediction space indirectly, meanwhile, assigning new label values in the unsupervised frameworks accordingly. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show empirically that with the simple solution -- Unsupervised image mixtures (Un-Mix), we can learn more robust visual representations from the transformed input. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet and standard ImageNet with popular unsupervised methods SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo V1&V2, etc. Our proposed image mixture and label assignment strategy can obtain consistent improvement by 1~3% following exactly the same hyperparameters and training procedures of the base methods.",0

"A growing body of research suggests that embodied gameplay, prevalent not just in human cultures but across a variety of animal species including turtles and ravens, is critical in developing the neural flexibility for creative problem solving, decision making, and socialization. Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of embodied gameplay upon artificial agents. While recent work has produced agents proficient in abstract games, these environments are far removed from the real world and thus these agents can provide little insight into the advantages of embodied play. Hiding games, such as hide-and-seek, played universally, provide a rich ground for studying the impact of embodied gameplay on representation learning in the context of perspective taking, secret keeping, and false belief understanding. Here we are the first to show that embodied adversarial reinforcement learning agents playing Cache, a variant of hide-and-seek, in a high fidelity, interactive, environment, learn generalizable representations of their observations encoding information such as object permanence, free space, and containment. Moving closer to biologically motivated learning strategies, our agents' representations, enhanced by intentionality and memory, are developed through interaction and play. These results serve as a model for studying how facets of vision develop through interaction, provide an experimental framework for assessing what is learned by artificial agents, and demonstrates the value of moving from large, static, datasets towards experiential, interactive, representation learning.",0

"Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are essential tools in end-to-end representation learning. However, the sequential text generation common pitfall with VAEs is that the model tends to ignore latent variables with a strong auto-regressive decoder. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to alleviate this issue by applying a discretized bottleneck to enforce an implicit latent feature matching in a more compact latent space. We impose a shared discrete latent space where each input is learned to choose a combination of latent atoms as a regularized latent representation. Our model endows a promising capability to model underlying semantics of discrete sequences and thus provide more interpretative latent structures. Empirically, we demonstrate our model's efficiency and effectiveness on a broad range of tasks, including language modeling, unaligned text style transfer, dialog response generation, and neural machine translation.",0

"Large scale recommender models find most relevant items from huge catalogs, and they play a critical role in modern search and recommendation systems. To model the input space with large-vocab categorical features, a typical recommender model learns a joint embedding space through neural networks for both queries and items from user feedback data. However, with millions to billions of items in the corpus, users tend to provide feedback for a very small set of them, causing a power-law distribution. This makes the feedback data for long-tail items extremely sparse.   Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised representation learning research in both computer vision and natural language understanding, we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for large-scale item recommendations. The framework is designed to tackle the label sparsity problem by learning better latent relationship of item features. Specifically, SSL improves item representation learning as well as serving as additional regularization to improve generalization. Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation method that utilizes feature correlations within the proposed framework.   We evaluate our framework using two real-world datasets with 500M and 1B training examples respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSL regularization and show its superior performance over the state-of-the-art regularization techniques. We also have already launched the proposed techniques to a web-scale commercial app-to-app recommendation system, with significant improvements top-tier business metrics demonstrated in A/B experiments on live traffic.

Specifically, we theoretically link balance to the quality of propensity estimation, emphasize the importance of identifying a proper target population, and elaborate on the complementary roles of feature balancing and weight adjustments. Using these concepts, we then develop an algorithm for flexible, scalable and accurate estimation of causal effects. Finally, we show how the learned weighted representations may serve to facilitate alternative causal learning procedures with appealing statistical features.

"Representation learning approaches require a massive amount of discriminative training data, which is unavailable in many scenarios, such as healthcare, smart city, education, etc. In practice, people refer to crowdsourcing to get annotated labels. However, due to issues like data privacy, budget limitation, shortage of domain-specific annotators, the number of crowdsourced labels is still very limited. Moreover, because of annotators' diverse expertises, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent. Thus, directly applying existing supervised representation learning (SRL) algorithms may easily get the overfitting problem and yield suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \emph{NeuCrowd}, a unified framework for SRL from crowdsourced labels. The proposed framework (1) creates a sufficient number of high-quality \emph{n}-tuplet training samples by utilizing safety-aware sampling and robust anchor generation; and (2) automatically learns a neural sampling network that adaptively learns to select effective samples for SRL networks. The proposed framework is evaluated on both one synthetic and three real-world data sets.

This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.",0

These connections, for instance, the co-occurrence of diseases and lab-disease correlations can be informative when only a subset of these variables is documented by the clinician. A feasible approach to improving the representation learning of EHR data is to associate relevant medical concepts and utilize these connections. Existing medical ontologies can be the reference for EHR structures, but they place numerous constraints on the data source. Recent progress on graph neural networks (GNN) enables end-to-end learning of topological structures for non-grid or non-sequential data. However, there are problems to be addressed on how to learn the medical graph adaptively and how to understand the effect of the medical graph on representation learning. In this paper, we propose a variationally regularized encoder-decoder graph network that achieves more robustness in graph structure learning by regularizing node representations. Our model outperforms the existing graph and non-graph based methods in various EHR predictive tasks based on both public data and real-world clinical data. Besides the improvements in empirical experiment performances, we provide an interpretation of the effect of variational regularization compared to standard graph neural network, using singular value analysis.",0

"Self-supervised tasks have been utilized to build useful representations that can be used in downstream tasks when the annotation is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised video representation learning method based on the multi-transformation classification to efficiently classify human actions. Self-supervised learning on various transformations not only provides richer contextual information but also enables the visual representation more robust to the transforms. The spatio-temporal representation of the video is learned in a self-supervised manner by classifying seven different transformations i.e. rotation, clip inversion, permutation, split, join transformation, color switch, frame replacement, noise addition. First, seven different video transformations are applied to video clips. Then the 3D convolutional neural networks are utilized to extract features for clips and these features are processed to classify the pseudo-labels. We use the learned models in pretext tasks as the pre-trained models and fine-tune them to recognize human actions in the downstream task. We have conducted the experiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets together with C3D and 3D Resnet-18 as backbone networks. The experimental results have shown that our proposed framework is outperformed other SOTA self-supervised action recognition approaches. The code will be made publicly available.",0

"Classical machine learning implicitly assumes that labels of the training data are sampled from a clean distribution, which can be too restrictive for real-world scenarios. However, statistical-learning-based methods may not train deep learning models robustly with these noisy labels. Therefore, it is urgent to design Label-Noise Representation Learning (LNRL) methods for robustly training deep models with noisy labels. To fully understand LNRL, we conduct a survey study. We first clarify a formal definition for LNRL from the perspective of machine learning. Then, via the lens of learning theory and empirical study, we figure out why noisy labels affect deep models' performance. Based on the theoretical guidance, we categorize different LNRL methods into three directions. Under this unified taxonomy, we provide a thorough discussion of the pros and cons of different categories. More importantly, we summarize the essential components of robust LNRL, which can spark new directions. Lastly, we propose possible research directions within LNRL, such as new datasets, instance-dependent LNRL, and adversarial LNRL. We also envision potential directions beyond LNRL, such as learning with feature-noise, preference-noise, domain-noise, similarity-noise, graph-noise and demonstration-noise.",0

"Molecular machine learning bears promise for efficient molecule property prediction and drug discovery. However, due to the limited labeled data and the giant chemical space, machine learning models trained via supervised learning perform poorly in generalization. This greatly limits the applications of machine learning methods for molecular design and discovery. In this work, we present MolCLR: Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a self-supervised learning framework for large unlabeled molecule datasets. Specifically, we first build a molecular graph, where each node represents an atom and each edge represents a chemical bond. A GNN is then used to encode the molecule graph. We propose three novel molecule graph augmentations: atom masking, bond deletion, and subgraph removal. A contrastive estimator is utilized to maximize the agreement of different graph augmentations from the same molecule. Experiments show that molecule representations learned by MolCLR can be transferred to multiple downstream molecular property prediction tasks. Our method thus achieves state-of-the-art performance on many challenging datasets.

"The collection and sharing of individuals' data has become commonplace in many industries. Local differential privacy (LDP) is a rigorous approach to preserving data privacy even from a database administrator, unlike the more standard central differential privacy. To achieve LDP, one traditionally adds noise directly to each data dimension, but for high-dimensional data the level of noise required for sufficient anonymization all but entirely destroys the data's utility. In this paper, we introduce a novel LDP mechanism that leverages representation learning to overcome the prohibitive noise requirements of direct methods. We demonstrate that, rather than simply estimating aggregate statistics of the privatized data as is the norm in LDP applications, our method enables the training of performant machine learning models. Unique applications of our approach include private novel-class classification and the augmentation of clean datasets with additional privatized features. Methods that rely on central differential privacy are not applicable to such tasks. Our approach achieves significant performance gains on these tasks relative to state-of-the-art LDP benchmarks that noise data directly.",0
"The practice of collecting and sharing personal data has become widespread across various industries. Local differential privacy (LDP) is a meticulous method of safeguarding data privacy, even from an administrator, in contrast to the more typical central differential privacy.

This study presents a new LDP technique that utilizes representation learning to overcome the noise requirements of direct methods. Unlike conventional LDP applications that only estimate aggregate statistics of anonymized data, our method enables the training of robust machine learning models, allowing for private novel-class classification and the expansion of clean datasets with additional anonymized features. These tasks are not feasible with central differential privacy methods. Our novel approach outperforms existing LDP benchmarks that apply direct noise to data.",1
"Generative modeling has recently seen many exciting developments with the advent of deep generative architectures such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The ability to draw synthetic i.i.d. observations with the same joint probability distribution as a given dataset has a wide range of applications including representation learning, compression or imputation. It appears that it also has many applications in privacy preserving data analysis, especially when used in conjunction with differential privacy techniques.

"Corporate credit rating reflects the level of corporate credit and plays a crucial role in modern financial risk control. But real-world credit rating data usually shows long-tail distributions, which means heavy class imbalanced problem challenging the corporate credit rating system greatly. To tackle that, inspried by the recent advances of pre-train techniques in self-supervised representation learning, we propose a novel framework named Contrastive Pre-training for Corporate Credit Rating (CP4CCR), which utilizes the self-surpervision for getting over class imbalance. Specifically, we propose to, in the first phase, exert constrastive self-superivised pre-training without label information, which want to learn a better class-agnostic initialization. During this phase, two self-supervised task are developed within CP4CCR: (i) Feature Masking (FM) and (ii) Feature Swapping(FS).

"Knowledge Graphs (KG) are gaining increasing attention in both academia and industry. Despite their diverse benefits, recent research have identified social and cultural biases embedded in the representations learned from KGs. Such biases can have detrimental consequences on different population and minority groups as applications of KG begin to intersect and interact with social spheres. This paper aims at identifying and mitigating such biases in Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings. As a first step, we explore popularity bias -- the relationship between node popularity and link prediction accuracy. In case of node2vec graph embeddings, we find that prediction accuracy of the embedding is negatively correlated with the degree of the node. However, in case of knowledge-graph embeddings (KGE), we observe an opposite trend. As a second step, we explore gender bias in KGE, and a careful examination of popular KGE algorithms suggest that sensitive attribute like the gender of a person can be predicted from the embedding. This implies that such biases in popular KGs is captured by the structural properties of the embedding. As a preliminary solution to debiasing KGs, we introduce a novel framework to filter out the sensitive attribute information from the KG embeddings, which we call FAN (Filtering Adversarial Network). We also suggest the applicability of FAN for debiasing other network embeddings which could be explored in future work.",0

These biases can have negative impacts on minority groups as KGs begin to intersect with social spheres. This study aims to identify and address such biases in KG embeddings. The first step is to examine popularity bias, where greater node popularity is associated with lower link prediction accuracy. The results show that this is true for node2vec graph embeddings, but the opposite is observed for knowledge-graph embeddings (KGE). The second step is to investigate gender bias in KGE, which can predict sensitive attributes such as a person's gender. To mitigate such biases, a new framework called Filtering Adversarial Network (FAN) is proposed to remove sensitive attribute information from KG embeddings. This solution can also be applied to other network embeddings in future research.",1

"Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space. Specifically, ""fully-connected layers with Quaternions"" (4D hypercomplex numbers), which replace real-valued matrix multiplications in fully-connected layers with Hamilton products of Quaternions, both enjoy parameter savings with only 1/4 learnable parameters and achieve comparable performance in various applications. However, one key caveat is that hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and 16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex multiplications. To this end, we propose parameterizing hypercomplex multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary nD hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using arbitrarily $1/n$ learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer counterpart. Experiments of applications to the LSTM and Transformer models on natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and subject verb agreement demonstrate architectural flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0

"Deep RL approaches build much of their success on the ability of the deep neural network to generate useful internal representations. Nevertheless, they suffer from a high sample-complexity and starting with a good input representation can have a significant impact on the performance. In this paper, we exploit the fact that the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) represents a graph, which enables us to incorporate the topological information for effective state representation learning.   Motivated by the recent success of node representations for several graph analytical tasks we specifically investigate the capability of node representation learning methods to effectively encode the topology of the underlying MDP in Deep RL. To this end we perform a comparative analysis of several models chosen from 4 different classes of representation learning algorithms for policy learning in grid-world navigation tasks, which are representative of a large class of RL problems. We find that all embedding methods outperform the commonly used matrix representation of grid-world environments in all of the studied cases.

"Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a popular technique to identify associations between products, which is crucial for business decision making. Previous studies typically adopt conventional frequent itemset mining algorithms to perform MBA. However, they generally fail to uncover rarely occurring associations among the products at their most granular level. Also, they have limited ability to capture temporal dynamics in associations between products. Hence, we propose OMBA, a novel representation learning technique for Online Market Basket Analysis. OMBA jointly learns representations for products and users such that they preserve the temporal dynamics of product-to-product and user-to-product associations. Subsequently, OMBA proposes a scalable yet effective online method to generate products' associations using their representations.

"COVID-19 classification using chest Computed Tomography (CT) has been found pragmatically useful by several studies. Due to the lack of annotated samples, these studies recommend transfer learning and explore the choices of pre-trained models and data augmentation.

"The success of deep learning in the computer vision and natural language processing communities can be attributed to training of very deep neural networks with millions or billions of parameters which can then be trained with massive amounts of data. However, similar trend has largely eluded training of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where larger networks do not lead to performance improvement. Previous work has shown that this is mostly due to instability during training of deep RL agents when using larger networks. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand and address training of larger networks for deep RL. We first show that naively increasing network capacity does not improve performance. Then, we propose a novel method that consists of 1) wider networks with DenseNet connection, 2) decoupling representation learning from training of RL, 3) a distributed training method to mitigate overfitting problems. Using this three-fold technique, we show that we can train very large networks that result in significant performance gains.

"The original design of Graph Convolution Network (GCN) couples feature transformation and neighborhood aggregation for node representation learning. Recently, some work shows that coupling is inferior to decoupling, which supports deep graph propagation better and has become the latest paradigm of GCN (e.g., APPNP and SGCN). Despite effectiveness, the working mechanisms of the decoupled GCN are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the decoupled GCN for semi-supervised node classification from a novel and fundamental perspective -- label propagation. We conduct thorough theoretical analyses, proving that the decoupled GCN is essentially the same as the two-step label propagation: first, propagating the known labels along the graph to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled nodes, and second, training normal neural network classifiers on the augmented pseudo-labeled data. More interestingly, we reveal the effectiveness of decoupled GCN: going beyond the conventional label propagation, it could automatically assign structure- and model- aware weights to the pseudo-label data. This explains why the decoupled GCN is relatively robust to the structure noise and over-smoothing, but sensitive to the label noise and model initialization. Based on this insight, we propose a new label propagation method named Propagation then Training Adaptively (PTA), which overcomes the flaws of the decoupled GCN with a dynamic and adaptive weighting strategy. Our PTA is simple yet more effective and robust than decoupled GCN. We empirically validate our findings on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating the advantages of our method.

"Clustering performs an essential role in many real world applications, such as market research, pattern recognition, data analysis, and image processing. However, due to the high dimensionality of the input feature values, the data being fed to clustering algorithms usually contains noise and thus could lead to in-accurate clustering results. While traditional dimension reduction and feature selection algorithms could be used to address this problem, the simple heuristic rules used in those algorithms are based on some particular assumptions. When those assumptions does not hold, these algorithms then might not work. In this paper, we propose DAC, Deep Autoencoder-based Clustering, a generalized data-driven framework to learn clustering representations using deep neuron networks.

"This paper describes an end-to-end solution for the relationship prediction task in heterogeneous, multi-relational graphs. We particularly address two building blocks in the pipeline, namely heterogeneous graph representation learning and negative sampling. Existing message passing-based graph neural networks use edges either for graph traversal and/or selection of message encoding functions. Ignoring the edge semantics could have severe repercussions on the quality of embeddings, especially when dealing with two nodes having multiple relations. Furthermore, the expressivity of the learned representation depends on the quality of negative samples used during training. Although existing hard negative sampling techniques can identify challenging negative relationships for optimization, new techniques are required to control false negatives during training as false negatives could corrupt the learning process. To address these issues, first, we propose RelGNN -- a message passing-based heterogeneous graph attention model. In particular, RelGNN generates the states of different relations and leverages them along with the node states to weigh the messages. RelGNN also adopts a self-attention mechanism to balance the importance of attribute features and topological features for generating the final entity embeddings. Second, we introduce a parameter-free negative sampling technique -- adaptive self-adversarial (ASA) negative sampling. ASA reduces the false-negative rate by leveraging positive relationships to effectively guide the identification of true negative samples. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that RelGNN optimized by ASA for relationship prediction improves state-of-the-art performance across established benchmarks as well as on a real industrial dataset.",0

Traditional methods for graph neural networks rely on edges to traverse graphs and encode messages, but this can lead to poor quality embeddings when dealing with nodes with multiple relationships. Moreover, the accuracy of learned representation depends on negative samples used during training, and existing techniques can produce false negatives that corrupt the learning process. To address these issues, we propose RelGNN, which is a message passing-based heterogeneous graph attention model that generates relation states and self-attention mechanisms to balance attribute and topological features. We also introduce a novel negative sampling technique, ASA, which uses positive relationships to guide the identification of true negative samples. Our experimental results show that RelGNN optimized by ASA outperforms existing methods on established benchmarks and real-world datasets.",1
"Learning low-level node embeddings using techniques from network representation learning is useful for solving downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. An important consideration in such applications is the robustness of the embedding algorithms against adversarial attacks, which can be examined by performing perturbation on the original network. An efficient perturbation technique can degrade the performance of network embeddings on downstream tasks. In this paper, we study network embedding algorithms from an adversarial point of view and observe the effect of poisoning the network on downstream tasks. We propose VIKING, a supervised network poisoning strategy that outperforms the state-of-the-art poisoning methods by upto 18% on the original network structure. We also extend VIKING to a semi-supervised attack setting and show that it is comparable to its supervised counterpart.",0
"Utilizing techniques from network representation learning to learn low-level node embeddings is advantageous for solving various downstream tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, when employing embedding algorithms in such applications, it is essential to consider their resilience against adversarial attacks. To examine this, perturbation on the primary network can be performed. An effective perturbation technique can decrease the quality of network embeddings for downstream tasks. This paper explores network embedding algorithms from an adversarial viewpoint and analyzes the impact of network poisoning on downstream tasks. The authors present VIKING, a supervised network poisoning approach that surpasses current poisoning methods by up to 18% on the initial network structure. They also extend VIKING to a semi-supervised attack scenario and prove its similarity to its supervised counterpart.",1
"Domain generalization refers to the problem where we aim to train a model on data from a set of source domains so that the model can generalize to unseen target domains. Naively training a model on the aggregate set of data (pooled from all source domains) has been shown to perform suboptimally, since the information learned by that model might be domain-specific and generalize imperfectly to target domains. To tackle this problem, a predominant approach is to find and learn some domain-invariant information in order to use it for the prediction task. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded method to learn a domain-invariant representation by enforcing the representation network to be invariant under all transformation functions among domains. We also show how to use generative adversarial networks to learn such domain transformations to implement our method in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several widely used datasets for the domain generalization problem, on all of which we achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art models.",0
"The issue of domain generalization involves training a model using data from various source domains, with the goal of enabling the model to work effectively with unseen target domains. Simply training a model using data pooled from all source domains has been found to be suboptimal, as the information learned may be specific to certain domains and may not translate well to target domains. To address this problem, a commonly used approach is to identify and learn domain-invariant information that can be used for prediction tasks. This paper presents a method for learning a domain-invariant representation by enforcing the representation network to be invariant under all transformation functions between domains, based on theoretical principles. Additionally, we demonstrate how to use generative adversarial networks to learn domain transformations to apply this method practically. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several popular datasets used for the domain generalization problem, and demonstrate competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models.",1
"The low rank MDP has emerged as an important model for studying representation learning and exploration in reinforcement learning. With a known representation, several model-free exploration strategies exist. In contrast, all algorithms for the unknown representation setting are model-based, thereby requiring the ability to model the full dynamics. In this work, we present the first model-free representation learning algorithms for low rank MDPs. The key algorithmic contribution is a new minimax representation learning objective, for which we provide variants with differing tradeoffs in their statistical and computational properties. We interleave this representation learning step with an exploration strategy to cover the state space in a reward-free manner. The resulting algorithms are provably sample efficient and can accommodate general function approximation to scale to complex environments.",0

"We propose a Healthcare Graph Convolutional Network (HealGCN) to offer disease self-diagnosis service for online users based on Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs). Two main challenges are focused in this paper for online disease diagnosis: (1) serving cold-start users via graph convolutional networks and (2) handling scarce clinical description via a symptom retrieval system. To this end, we first organize the EHR data into a heterogeneous graph that is capable of modeling complex interactions among users, symptoms and diseases, and tailor the graph representation learning towards disease diagnosis with an inductive learning paradigm. Then, we build a disease self-diagnosis system with a corresponding EHR Graph-based Symptom Retrieval System (GraphRet) that can search and provide a list of relevant alternative symptoms by tracing the predefined meta-paths. GraphRet helps enrich the seed symptom set through the EHR graph when confronting users with scarce descriptions, hence yield better diagnosis accuracy.

"Contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) leverages unlabeled data to train models that provide instance-discriminative visual representations uniformly scattered in the feature space. In deployment, the common practice is to directly fine-tune models with the cross-entropy loss, which however may not be an optimal strategy. Although cross-entropy tends to separate inter-class features, the resulted models still have limited capability of reducing intra-class feature scattering that inherits from pre-training, and thus may suffer unsatisfactory performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether applying contrastive learning to fine-tuning would bring further benefits, and analytically find that optimizing the supervised contrastive loss benefits both class-discriminative representation learning and model optimization during fine-tuning. Inspired by these findings, we propose Contrast-regularized tuning (Core-tuning), a novel approach for fine-tuning contrastive self-supervised visual models. Instead of simply adding the contrastive loss to the objective of fine-tuning, Core-tuning also generates hard sample pairs for more effective contrastive learning through a novel feature mixup strategy, as well as improves the generalizability of the model by smoothing the decision boundary via mixed samples. Extensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of Core-tuning.",0

"Current state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods for graph neural networks (GNNs) are based on contrastive learning. As such, they heavily depend on the construction of augmentations and negative examples. For example, on the standard PPI benchmark, increasing the number of negative pairs improves performance, thereby requiring computation and memory cost quadratic in the number of nodes to achieve peak performance. Inspired by BYOL, a recently introduced method for self-supervised learning that does not require negative pairs, we present Bootstrapped Graph Latents, BGRL, a self-supervised graph representation method that gets rid of this potentially quadratic bottleneck. BGRL outperforms or matches the previous unsupervised state-of-the-art results on several established benchmark datasets. Moreover, it enables the effective usage of graph attentional (GAT) encoders, allowing us to further improve the state of the art. In particular on the PPI dataset, using GAT as an encoder we achieve state-of-the-art 70.49% Micro-F1, using the linear evaluation protocol. On all other datasets under consideration, our model is competitive with the equivalent supervised GNN results, often exceeding them.",0

"CNN feature spaces can be linearly mapped and consequently are often interchangeable. This equivalence holds across variations in architectures, training datasets, and network tasks. Specifically, we mapped between 10 image-classification CNNs and between 4 facial-recognition CNNs. When image embeddings generated by one CNN are transformed into embeddings corresponding to the feature space of a second CNN trained on the same task, their respective image classification or face verification performance is largely preserved. For CNNs trained to the same classes and sharing a common backend-logit (soft-max) architecture, a linear-mapping may always be calculated directly from the backend layer weights. However, the case of a closed-set analysis with perfect knowledge of classifiers is limiting. Therefore, empirical methods of estimating mappings are presented for both the closed-set image classification task and the open-set task of face recognition. The results presented expose the essentially interchangeable nature of CNNs embeddings for two important and common recognition tasks. The implications are far-reaching, suggesting an underlying commonality between representations learned by networks designed and trained for a common task. One practical implication is that face embeddings from some commonly used CNNs can be compared using these mappings.",0

"The knowledge that data lies close to a particular submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space may be useful in a number of ways. For instance, one may want to automatically mark any point far away from the submanifold as an outlier, or to use its geodesic distance to measure similarity between points. Classical problems for manifold learning are often posed in a very high dimension, e.g. for spaces of images or spaces of representations of words. Today, with deep representation learning on the rise in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing, many problems of this kind may be transformed into problems of moderately high dimension, typically of the order of hundreds. Motivated by this, we propose a manifold learning technique suitable for moderately high dimension and large datasets. The manifold is learned from the training data in the form of an intersection of quadric hypersurfaces -- simple but expressive objects. At test time, this manifold can be used to introduce an outlier score for arbitrary new points and to improve a given similarity metric by incorporating learned geometric structure into it.",0
"The understanding that data is located in close proximity to a specific submanifold within the larger Euclidean space can be advantageous in multiple ways. For example, one may wish to automatically flag any points that are far from the submanifold as outliers, or use the geodesic distance to quantify the similarity between points. Traditional problems in manifold learning are often presented in very high dimensions, such as for image spaces or word representation spaces. However, with the growing popularity of deep representation learning in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, many of these problems can now be transformed into moderately high-dimensional problems, typically with hundreds of dimensions. In light of this, we offer a manifold learning approach that is suitable for large datasets and moderately high dimensions. The manifold is learned from the training data as an intersection of quadric hypersurfaces, which are both simple and powerful objects. During testing, this manifold can be used to determine an outlier score for new points and enhance a given similarity metric by integrating the learned geometric structure.",1
"As the class size grows, maintaining a balanced dataset across many classes is challenging because the data are long-tailed in nature; it is even impossible when the sample-of-interest co-exists with each other in one collectable unit, e.g., multiple visual instances in one image. Therefore, long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However, existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove the ""bad"" while keep the ""good"". We achieve new state-of-the-arts on three long-tailed visual recognition benchmarks: Long-tailed CIFAR-10/-100, ImageNet-LT for image classification and LVIS for instance segmentation.",0

"Training a neural network with a large labeled dataset is still a dominant paradigm in computational histopathology. However, obtaining such exhaustive manual annotations is often expensive, laborious, and prone to inter and Intra-observer variability. While recent self-supervised and semi-supervised methods can alleviate this need by learn-ing unsupervised feature representations, they still struggle to generalize well to downstream tasks when the number of labeled instances is small. In this work, we overcome this challenge by leveraging both task-agnostic and task-specific unlabeled data based on two novel strategies: i) a self-supervised pretext task that harnesses the underlying multi-resolution contextual cues in histology whole-slide images to learn a powerful supervisory signal for unsupervised representation learning; ii) a new teacher-student semi-supervised consistency paradigm that learns to effectively transfer the pretrained representations to downstream tasks based on prediction consistency with the task-specific un-labeled data. We carry out extensive validation experiments on three histopathology benchmark datasets across two classification and one regression-based tasks, i.e., tumor metastasis detection, tissue type classification, and tumor cellularity quantification. Under limited-label data, the proposed method yields tangible improvements, which is close or even outperforming other state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised baselines. Furthermore, we empirically show that the idea of bootstrapping the self-supervised pretrained features is an effective way to improve the task-specific semi-supervised learning on standard benchmarks.

"Data augmentation is often used to enlarge datasets with synthetic samples generated in accordance with the underlying data distribution. To enable a wider range of augmentations, we explore negative data augmentation strategies (NDA)that intentionally create out-of-distribution samples. We show that such negative out-of-distribution samples provide information on the support of the data distribution, and can be leveraged for generative modeling and representation learning. We introduce a new GAN training objective where we use NDA as an additional source of synthetic data for the discriminator. We prove that under suitable conditions, optimizing the resulting objective still recovers the true data distribution but can directly bias the generator towards avoiding samples that lack the desired structure. Empirically, models trained with our method achieve improved conditional/unconditional image generation along with improved anomaly detection capabilities. Further, we incorporate the same negative data augmentation strategy in a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised representation learning on images and videos, achieving improved performance on downstream image classification, object detection, and action recognition tasks. These results suggest that prior knowledge on what does not constitute valid data is an effective form of weak supervision across a range of unsupervised learning tasks.",0

"This paper presents a simple unsupervised visual representation learning method with a pretext task of discriminating all images in a dataset using a parametric, instance-level classifier. The overall framework is a replica of a supervised classification model, where semantic classes (e.g., dog, bird, and ship) are replaced by instance IDs. However, scaling up the classification task from thousands of semantic labels to millions of instance labels brings specific challenges including 1) the large-scale softmax computation; 2) the slow convergence due to the infrequent visiting of instance samples; and 3) the massive number of negative classes that can be noisy. This work presents several novel techniques to handle these difficulties. First, we introduce a hybrid parallel training framework to make large-scale training feasible. Second, we present a raw-feature initialization mechanism for classification weights, which we assume offers a contrastive prior for instance discrimination and can clearly speed up converge in our experiments. Finally, we propose to smooth the labels of a few hardest classes to avoid optimizing over very similar negative pairs. While being conceptually simple, our framework achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, i.e., SimCLR, MoCoV2, and PIC under ImageNet linear evaluation protocol and on several downstream visual tasks, verifying that full instance classification is a strong pretraining technique for many semantic visual tasks.",0

"Representation learning for graphs enables the application of standard machine learning algorithms and data analysis tools to graph data. Replacing discrete unordered objects such as graph nodes by real-valued vectors is at the heart of many approaches to learning from graph data. Such vector representations, or embeddings, capture the discrete relationships in the original data by representing nodes as vectors in a high-dimensional space.   In most applications graphs model the relationship between real-life objects and often nodes contain valuable meta-information about the original objects. While being a powerful machine learning tool, embeddings are not able to preserve such node attributes. We address this shortcoming and consider the problem of learning discrete node embeddings such that the coordinates of the node vector representations are graph nodes. This opens the door to designing interpretable machine learning algorithms for graphs as all attributes originally present in the nodes are preserved.   We present a framework for coordinated local graph neighborhood sampling (COLOGNE) such that each node is represented by a fixed number of graph nodes, together with their attributes. Individual samples are coordinated and they preserve the similarity between node neighborhoods. We consider different notions of similarity for which we design scalable algorithms. We show theoretical results for all proposed algorithms.

"Data privacy is an increasingly important aspect of many real-world Data sources that contain sensitive information may have immense potential which could be unlocked using the right privacy enhancing transformations, but current methods often fail to produce convincing output. Furthermore, finding the right balance between privacy and utility is often a tricky trade-off. In this work, we propose a novel approach for data privatization, which involves two steps: in the first step, it removes the sensitive information, and in the second step, it replaces this information with an independent random sample. Our method builds on adversarial representation learning which ensures strong privacy by training the model to fool an increasingly strong adversary. While previous methods only aim at obfuscating the sensitive information, we find that adding new random information in its place strengthens the provided privacy and provides better utility at any given level of privacy. The result is an approach that can provide stronger privatization on image data, and yet be preserving both the domain and the utility of the inputs, entirely independent of the downstream task.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning techniques, such as learning word embeddings, have had a significant impact on the field of natural language processing. Similar representation learning techniques have not yet become commonplace in the context of 3D vision. This, despite the fact that the physical 3D spaces have a similar semantic structure to bodies of text: words are surrounded by words that are semantically related, just like objects are surrounded by other objects that are similar in concept and usage.   In this work, we exploit this structure in learning semantically meaningful low dimensional vector representations of objects. We learn these vector representations by mining a dataset of scanned 3D spaces using an unsupervised algorithm. We represent objects as point clouds, a flexible and general representation for 3D data, which we encode into a vector representation.

To exploit this structure, we use an unsupervised algorithm to mine a dataset of scanned 3D spaces and learn semantically meaningful low-dimensional vector representations of objects. We represent objects as point clouds, which we encode into vector representations. Our method increases the ability of clustering algorithms to distinguish different semantic classes from each other by including context. Interpolation experiments show that our algorithm produces continuous and meaningful object embeddings.",1
"This paper studies representation learning for multi-task linear bandits and multi-task episodic RL with linear value function approximation. We first consider the setting where we play $M$ linear bandits with dimension $d$ concurrently, and these bandits share a common $k$-dimensional linear representation so that $k\ll d$ and $k \ll M$. We propose a sample-efficient algorithm, MTLR-OFUL, which leverages the shared representation to achieve $\tilde{O}(M\sqrt{dkT} + d\sqrt{kMT} )$ regret, with $T$ being the number of total steps. Our regret significantly improves upon the baseline $\tilde{O}(Md\sqrt{T})$ achieved by solving each task independently. We further develop a lower bound that shows our regret is near-optimal when $d > M$. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm and analysis to multi-task episodic RL with linear value function approximation under low inherent Bellman error \citep{zanette2020learning}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result that characterizes the benefits of multi-task representation learning for exploration in RL with function approximation.",0
"The focus of this research is on representation learning for multi-task linear bandits and multi-task episodic RL using linear value function approximation. The study begins by examining the scenario where $M$ linear bandits are played simultaneously, each with a dimension of $d$, and share a common linear representation of $k$ dimensions, where $k$ is significantly smaller than both $d$ and $M$. To achieve a low regret, we propose the MTLR-OFUL algorithm, which capitalizes on the shared representation and achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(M\sqrt{dkT} + d\sqrt{kMT} )$, where $T$ is the total number of steps. This regret is much lower than the baseline of $\tilde{O}(Md\sqrt{T})$, which is the regret obtained when each task is solved independently. We also present a lower bound that shows that our regret is nearly optimal when $d > M$. Additionally, we extend the algorithm and analysis to multi-task episodic RL with linear value function approximation under low inherent Bellman error. This research is the first to theoretically characterize the advantages of multi-task representation learning for exploration in RL with function approximation.",1
"Privacy-preserving representation learning (PPRL) aims to learn a data encoding that obfuscates sensitive information and retains target information. We develop the Exclusion-Inclusion Generative Adversarial Network (EIGAN), which generalizes existing adversarial PPRL approaches to account for multiple, potentially overlapping ally and adversary objectives in a dataset. We further extend EIGAN to the case where the data is distributed and cannot be centrally aggregated for training due to privacy constraints. In doing so, we introduce D-EIGAN, the first distributed PPRL method, which decentralizes EIGAN training based on federated learning with fractional parameter sharing. We theoretically analyze the convergence of EIGAN and behavior of adversaries under the optimal EIGAN and D-EIGAN encoders, considering the impact of dependencies among target and sensitive objectives on the encoder performance. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of EIGAN encodings in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability; EIGAN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in centralized PPRL by a significant margin (47%). The experiments further reveal that D-EIGAN's performance is consistent with that of EIGAN under different node data distributions and is resilient to communication constraints.",0

"Missing node attributes is a common problem in real-world graphs. Graph neural networks have been demonstrated powerful in graph representation learning, however, they rely heavily on the completeness of graph information. Few of them consider the incomplete node attributes, which can bring great damage to the performance in practice. In this paper, we propose an innovative node representation learning framework, Wasserstein graph diffusion (WGD), to mitigate the problem. Instead of feature imputation, our method directly learns node representations from the missing-attribute graphs. Specifically, we extend the message passing schema in general graph neural networks to a Wasserstein space derived from the decomposition of attribute matrices. We test WGD in node classification tasks under two settings: missing whole attributes on some nodes and missing only partial attributes on all nodes. In addition, we find WGD is suitable to recover missing values and adapt it to tackle matrix completion problems with graphs of users and items. Experimental results on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.",0

"Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning these linear features.",0

"Disentanglement is a useful property in representation learning which increases the interpretability of generative models such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Models, and their many variants. Typically in such models, an increase in disentanglement performance is traded-off with generation quality. In the context of latent space models, this work presents a representation learning framework that explicitly promotes disentanglement by encouraging orthogonal directions of variations. The proposed objective is the sum of an auto-encoder error term along with a Principal Component Analysis reconstruction error in the feature space. This has an interpretation of a Restricted Kernel Machine with an interconnection matrix on the Stiefel manifold. Our analysis shows that such a construction promotes disentanglement by matching the principal directions in latent space with the directions of orthogonal variation in data space. The training algorithm involves a stochastic optimization method on the Stiefel manifold, which increases only marginally the computing time compared to an analogous VAE. Our theoretical discussion and various experiments show that the proposed model improves over many VAE variants in terms of both generation quality and disentangled representation learning.",0

"Most artificial neural networks used for object detection and recognition are trained in a fully supervised setup. This is not only very resource consuming as it requires large data sets of labeled examples but also very different from how humans learn. We introduce a setup in which an artificial agent first learns in a simulated world through self-supervised exploration. Following this, the representations learned through interaction with the world can be used to associate semantic concepts such as different types of doors. To do this, we use a method we call fast concept mapping which uses correlated firing patterns of neurons to define and detect semantic concepts. This association works instantaneous with very few labeled examples, similar to what we observe in humans in a phenomenon called fast mapping. Strikingly, this method already identifies objects with as little as one labeled example which highlights the quality of the encoding learned self-supervised through embodiment using curiosity-driven exploration. It therefor presents a feasible strategy for learning concepts without much supervision and shows that through pure interaction with the world meaningful representations of an environment can be learned.",0

"Organ transplantation is often the last resort for treating end-stage illness, but the probability of a successful transplantation depends greatly on compatibility between donors and recipients. Current medical practice relies on coarse rules for donor-recipient matching, but is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex factors underlying organ compatibility. In this paper, we formulate the problem of learning data-driven rules for organ matching using observational data for organ allocations and transplant outcomes. This problem departs from the standard supervised learning setup in that it involves matching the two feature spaces (i.e., donors and recipients), and requires estimating transplant outcomes under counterfactual matches not observed in the data. To address these problems, we propose a model based on representation learning to predict donor-recipient compatibility; our model learns representations that cluster donor features, and applies donor-invariant transformations to recipient features to predict outcomes for a given donor-recipient feature instance. Experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-art allocation methods and policies executed by human experts.",0

"For machine learning models to be most useful in numerous sociotechnical systems, many have argued that they must be human-interpretable. However, despite increasing interest in interpretability, there remains no firm consensus on how to measure it. This is especially true in representation learning, where interpretability research has focused on ""disentanglement"" measures only applicable to synthetic datasets and not grounded in human factors. We introduce a task to quantify the human-interpretability of generative model representations, where users interactively modify representations to reconstruct target instances. On synthetic datasets, we find performance on this task much more reliably differentiates entangled and disentangled models than baseline approaches. On a real dataset, we find it differentiates between representation learning methods widely believed but never shown to produce more or less interpretable models. In both cases, we ran small-scale think-aloud studies and large-scale experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk to confirm that our qualitative and quantitative results agreed.",0

"Anomaly detection is a challenging problem in machine learning, and is even more so when dealing with instances that are captured in low-level, raw data representations without a well-behaved set of engineered features. The Radial Basis Function Data Descriptor (RBFDD) network is an effective solution for anomaly detection, however, it is a shallow model that does not deal effectively with raw data representations. This paper investigates approaches to modifying the RBFDD network to transform it into a deep one-class classifier suitable for anomaly detection problems with low-level raw data representations. We show that approaches based on transfer learning are not effective and our results suggest that this is because the latent representations learned by generic classification models are not suitable for anomaly detection. Instead we show that an approach that adds multiple convolutional layers before the RBF layer, to form a Deep Radial Basis Function Data Descriptor (D-RBFDD) network, is very effective. This is shown in a set of evaluation experiments using multiple anomaly detection scenarios created from publicly available image classification datasets, and a real-world anomaly detection dataset in which different types of arrhythmia are detected in electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Our experiments show that the D-RBFDD network out-performs state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods including the Deep Support Vector Data Descriptor (Deep SVDD), One-Class SVM, and Isolation Forest on the image datasets, and produces competitive results for the ECG dataset.",0

"This paper proposes a novel pretext task to address the self-supervised video representation learning problem. Specifically, given an unlabeled video clip, we compute a series of spatio-temporal statistical summaries, such as the spatial location and dominant direction of the largest motion, the spatial location and dominant color of the largest color diversity along the temporal axis, etc. Then a neural network is built and trained to yield the statistical summaries given the video frames as inputs. In order to alleviate the learning difficulty, we employ several spatial partitioning patterns to encode rough spatial locations instead of exact spatial Cartesian coordinates. Our approach is inspired by the observation that human visual system is sensitive to rapidly changing contents in the visual field, and only needs impressions about rough spatial locations to understand the visual contents. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments with four 3D backbone networks, i.e., C3D, 3D-ResNet, R(2+1)D and S3D-G. The results show that our approach outperforms the existing approaches across these backbone networks on four downstream video analysis tasks including action recognition, video retrieval, dynamic scene recognition, and action similarity labeling.

"Continual learning aims to provide intelligent agents capable of learning multiple tasks sequentially with neural networks. One of its main challenging, catastrophic forgetting, is caused by the neural networks non-optimal ability to learn in non-stationary distributions. In most settings of the current approaches, the agent starts from randomly initialized parameters and is optimized to master the current task regardless of the usefulness of the learned representation for future tasks. Moreover, each of the future tasks uses all the previously learned knowledge although parts of this knowledge might not be helpful for its learning. These cause interference among tasks, especially when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Self-Attention Meta-Learner (SAM), which learns a prior knowledge for continual learning that permits learning a sequence of tasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. SAM incorporates an attention mechanism that learns to select the particular relevant representation for each future task. Each task builds a specific representation branch on top of the selected knowledge, avoiding the interference between tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on the Split CIFAR-10/100 and Split MNIST benchmarks in the task agnostic inference. We empirically show that we can achieve a better performance than several state-of-the-art methods for continual learning by building on the top of selected representation learned by SAM. We also show the role of the meta-attention mechanism in boosting informative features corresponding to the input data and identifying the correct target in the task agnostic inference. Finally, we demonstrate that popular existing continual learning methods gain a performance boost when they adopt SAM as a starting point.",0

"This paper presents a novel framework for speech-driven gesture production, applicable to virtual agents to enhance human-computer interaction. Specifically, we extend recent deep-learning-based, data-driven methods for speech-driven gesture generation by incorporating representation learning. Our model takes speech as input and produces gestures as output, in the form of a sequence of 3D coordinates. We provide an analysis of different representations for the input (speech) and the output (motion) of the network by both objective and subjective evaluations. We also analyse the importance of smoothing of the produced motion. Our results indicated that the proposed method improved on our baseline in terms of objective measures. For example, it better captured the motion dynamics and better matched the motion-speed distribution. Moreover, we performed user studies on two different datasets. The studies confirmed that our proposed method is perceived as more natural than the baseline, although the difference in the studies was eliminated by appropriate post-processing: hip-centering and smoothing. We conclude that it is important to take both motion representation and post-processing into account when designing an automatic gesture-production method.",0

"A steady momentum of innovations and breakthroughs has convincingly pushed the limits of unsupervised image representation learning. Compared to static 2D images, video has one more dimension (time). The inherent supervision existing in such sequential structure offers a fertile ground for building unsupervised learning models. In this paper, we compose a trilogy of exploring the basic and generic supervision in the sequence from spatial, spatiotemporal and sequential perspectives. We materialize the supervisory signals through determining whether a pair of samples is from one frame or from one video, and whether a triplet of samples is in the correct temporal order. We uniquely regard the signals as the foundation in contrastive learning and derive a particular form named Sequence Contrastive Learning (SeCo). SeCo shows superior results under the linear protocol on action recognition (Kinetics), untrimmed activity recognition (ActivityNet) and object tracking (OTB-100). More remarkably, SeCo demonstrates considerable improvements over recent unsupervised pre-training techniques, and leads the accuracy by 2.96% and 6.47% against fully-supervised ImageNet pre-training in action recognition task on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively.

"Graph representation learning is an important task with applications in various areas such as online social networks, e-commerce networks, WWW, and semantic webs. For unsupervised graph representation learning, many algorithms such as Node2Vec and Graph-SAGE make use of ""negative sampling"" and/or noise contrastive estimation loss. This bears similar ideas to contrastive learning, which ""contrasts"" the node representation similarities of semantically similar (positive) pairs against those of negative pairs. However, despite the success of contrastive learning, we found that directly applying this technique to graph representation learning models (e.g., graph convolutional networks) does not always work. We theoretically analyze the generalization performance and propose a light-weight regularization term that avoids the high scales of node representations' norms and the high variance among them to improve the generalization performance. Our experimental results further validate that this regularization term significantly improves the representation quality across different node similarity definitions and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Prior highly-tuned image parsing models are usually studied in a certain domain with a specific set of semantic labels and can hardly be adapted into other scenarios (e.g., sharing discrepant label granularity) without extensive re-training. Learning a single universal parsing model by unifying label annotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity is a crucial but rarely addressed topic. This poses many fundamental learning challenges, e.g., discovering underlying semantic structures among different label granularity or mining label correlation across relevant tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a graph reasoning and transfer learning framework, named ""Graphonomy"", which incorporates human knowledge and label taxonomy into the intermediate graph representation learning beyond local convolutions. In particular, Graphonomy learns the global and structured semantic coherency in multiple domains via semantic-aware graph reasoning and transfer, enforcing the mutual benefits of the parsing across domains (e.g., different datasets or co-related tasks). The Graphonomy includes two iterated modules: Intra-Graph Reasoning and Inter-Graph Transfer modules. The former extracts the semantic graph in each domain to improve the feature representation learning by propagating information with the graph; the latter exploits the dependencies among the graphs from different domains for bidirectional knowledge transfer. We apply Graphonomy to two relevant but different image understanding research topics: human parsing and panoptic segmentation, and show Graphonomy can handle both of them well via a standard pipeline against current state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, some extra benefit of our framework is demonstrated, e.g., generating the human parsing at various levels of granularity by unifying annotations across different datasets.",0

In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.",0
"The data in electronic health records (EHR) is not consistent, as it is recorded at different times and there are varying clinical variables measured at each observation point. To address this issue, we suggest a self-attention mechanism for multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data without imputation. Our approach involves a unique multi-integration attention module (MIAM) that extracts complex information from irregular time series data by explicitly learning the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between consecutive observations. We use human knowledge to determine what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which indirectly influences the data. Furthermore, we have an attention-based decoder that serves as a missing value imputer and enhances the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task. Our method has been validated using the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets, and it has been proven to outperform state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.",1
"The rapid spread of COVID-19 cases in recent months has strained hospital resources, making rapid and accurate triage of patients presenting to emergency departments a necessity. Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study suggested that the prediction accuracy of our model is comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the same information.",0
"The recent surge in COVID-19 cases has put a strain on hospital resources, necessitating the need for quick and accurate triage of patients in emergency departments. One method used to predict the likelihood of patient deterioration is through machine learning techniques that analyze clinical data, such as chest X-rays. This study focuses on predicting two types of deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration and increased oxygen requirements. However, due to limited COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions rely on supervised pretraining on non-COVID images, which may not generalize well. To address this, the study uses self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast method during the pretraining phase to learn more generalized image representations. The study presents three main results, the first being that their model achieves an improved AUC for predicting adverse events and oxygen requirements compared to supervised pretraining. They also propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction, which further improves the AUC for predicting adverse events and mortalities at 96 hours. A pilot clinical study showed that the model's prediction accuracy is comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the same information.",1
"We study the generalization of deep learning models in relation to the convex hull of their training sets. A trained image classifier basically partitions its domain via decision boundaries and assigns a class to each of those partitions. The location of decision boundaries inside the convex hull of training set can be investigated in relation to the training samples. However, our analysis shows that in standard image classification datasets, all testing images are considerably outside that convex hull, in the pixel space, in the wavelet space, and in the internal representations learned by deep networks. Therefore, the performance of a trained model partially depends on how its decision boundaries are extended outside the convex hull of its training data. From this perspective which is not studied before, over-parameterization of deep learning models may be considered a necessity for shaping the extension of decision boundaries. At the same time, over-parameterization should be accompanied by a specific training regime, in order to yield a model that not only fits the training set, but also its decision boundaries extend desirably outside the convex hull. To illustrate this, we investigate the decision boundaries of a neural network, with various degrees of parameters, inside and outside the convex hull of its training set. Moreover, we use a polynomial decision boundary to study the necessity of over-parameterization and the influence of training regime in shaping its extensions outside the convex hull of training set.",0

"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and its variants have achieved success in meta-learning tasks on many datasets and settings. On the other hand, we have just started to understand and analyze how they are able to adapt fast to new tasks. For example, one popular hypothesis is that the algorithms learn good representations for transfer, as in multi-task learning. In this work, we contribute by providing a series of empirical and theoretical studies, and discover several interesting yet previously unknown properties of the algorithm. We find MAML adapts better with a deep architecture even if the tasks need only a shallow one (and thus, no representation learning is needed). While echoing previous findings by others that the bottom layers in deep architectures enable representation learning, we also find that upper layers enable fast adaptation by being meta-learned to perform adaptive gradient update when generalizing to new tasks. Motivated by these findings, we study several meta-optimization approaches and propose a new one for learning to optimize adaptively. Those approaches attain stronger performance in meta-learning both shallower and deeper architectures than MAML.",0
"MAML and its variations have been successful in meta-learning tasks across various datasets and settings.

We observe that MAML performs better with a deep architecture, even when the tasks require only a shallow one. Our findings indicate that while lower layers in deep architectures enable representation learning, upper layers facilitate rapid adaptation by meta-learning adaptive gradient updates. Building on these insights, we explore different meta-optimization approaches and introduce a new one for adaptive optimization. Our proposed approaches demonstrate superior performance in meta-learning across both shallow and deep architectures compared to MAML.",1
"Recent work on few-shot learning \cite{tian2020rethinking} showed that quality of learned representations plays an important role in few-shot classification performance. On the other hand, the goal of self-supervised learning is to recover useful semantic information of the data without the use of class labels. In this work, we exploit the complementarity of both paradigms via a multi-task framework where we leverage recent self-supervised methods as auxiliary tasks. We found that combining multiple tasks is often beneficial, and that solving them simultaneously can be done efficiently.

"One-class recognition is traditionally approached either as a representation learning problem or a feature modeling problem. In this work, we argue that both of these approaches have their own limitations; and a more effective solution can be obtained by combining the two. The proposed approach is based on the combination of a generative framework and a one-class classification method. First, we learn generative features using the one-class data with a generative framework. We augment the learned features with the corresponding reconstruction errors to obtain augmented features. Then, we qualitatively identify a suitable feature distribution that reduces the redundancy in the chosen classifier space. Finally, we force the augmented features to take the form of this distribution using an adversarial framework. We test the effectiveness of the proposed method on three one-class classification tasks and obtain state-of-the-art results.",0

"Deep generative models, since their inception, have become increasingly more capable of generating novel and perceptually realistic signals (e.g., images and sound waves). With the emergence of deep models for graph structured data, natural interests seek extensions of these generative models for graphs. Successful extensions were seen recently in the case of learning from a collection of graphs (e.g., protein data banks), but the learning from a single graph has been largely under explored. The latter case, however, is important in practice. For example, graphs in financial and healthcare systems contain so much confidential information that their public accessibility is nearly impossible, but open science in these fields can only advance when similar data are available for benchmarking.   In this work, we propose an approach to generating a doppelganger graph that resembles a given one in many graph properties but nonetheless can hardly be used to reverse engineer the original one, in the sense of a near zero edge overlap. The approach is an orchestration of graph representation learning, generative adversarial networks, and graph realization algorithms. Through comparison with several graph generative models (either parameterized by neural networks or not), we demonstrate that our result barely reproduces the given graph but closely matches its properties. We further show that downstream tasks, such as node classification, on the generated graphs reach similar performance to the use of the original ones.",0

"Face recognition has been an active and vital topic among computer vision community for a long time. Previous researches mainly focus on loss functions used for facial feature extraction network, among which the improvements of softmax-based loss functions greatly promote the performance of face recognition. However, the contradiction between the drastically increasing number of face identities and the shortage of GPU memories is gradually becoming irreconcilable. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the optimization goal of softmax-based loss functions and the difficulty of training massive identities. We find that the importance of negative classes in softmax function in face representation learning is not as high as we previously thought. The experiment demonstrates no loss of accuracy when training with only 10\% randomly sampled classes for the softmax-based loss functions, compared with training with full classes using state-of-the-art models on mainstream benchmarks. We also implement a very efficient distributed sampling algorithm, taking into account model accuracy and training efficiency, which uses only eight NVIDIA RTX2080Ti to complete classification tasks with tens of millions of identities.

"Many irregular domains such as social networks, financial transactions, neuron connections, and natural language constructs are represented using graph structures. In recent years, a variety of graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied for representation learning and prediction on such graphs. In many of the real-world applications, the underlying graph changes over time, however, most of the existing GNNs are inadequate for handling such dynamic graphs. In this paper we propose a novel technique for learning embeddings of dynamic graphs using a tensor algebra framework. Our method extends the popular graph convolutional network (GCN) for learning representations of dynamic graphs using the recently proposed tensor M-product technique. Theoretical results presented establish a connection between the proposed tensor approach and spectral convolution of tensors. The proposed method TM-GCN is consistent with the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework, accounting for both spatial and temporal message passing. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for edge classification and link prediction tasks on dynamic graphs.

"Human pose estimation - the process of recognizing human keypoints in a given image - is one of the most important tasks in computer vision and has a wide range of applications including movement diagnostics, surveillance, or self-driving vehicle. The accuracy of human keypoint prediction is increasingly improved thanks to the burgeoning development of deep learning. Most existing methods solved human pose estimation by generating heatmaps in which the ith heatmap indicates the location confidence of the ith keypoint. In this paper, we introduce novel network structures referred to as multi-resolution representation learning for human keypoint prediction. At different resolutions in the learning process, our networks branch off and use extra layers to learn heatmap generation. We firstly consider the architectures for generating the multi-resolution heatmaps after obtaining the lowest-resolution feature maps. Our second approach allows learning during the process of feature extraction in which the heatmaps are generated at each resolution of the feature extractor. The first and second approaches are referred to as multi-resolution heatmap learning and multi-resolution feature map learning respectively.

"This thesis is a proof of concept for the potential of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) on representation learning of real-world Knowledge Graphs (KG). Inspired by successful approaches to the generation of molecular graphs, we evaluate the capabilities of our model, the Relational Graph Variational Auto-Encoder (RGVAE). The impact of the modular hyperparameter choices, encoding through graph convolutions, graph matching and latent space prior, is compared. The RGVAE is first evaluated on link prediction. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores on the two datasets FB15K-237 and WN18RR are compared to the embedding-based model DistMult. A variational DistMult and a RGVAE without latent space prior constraint are implemented as control models. The results show that between different settings, the RGVAE with relaxed latent space, scores highest on both datasets, yet does not outperform the DistMult. Further, we investigate the latent space in a twofold experiment: first, linear interpolation between the latent representation of two triples, then the exploration of each latent dimension in a $95\%$ confidence interval. Both interpolations show that the RGVAE learns to reconstruct the adjacency matrix but fails to disentangle. For the last experiment we introduce a new validation method for the FB15K-237 data set. The relation type-constrains of generated triples are filtered and matched with entity types. The observed rate of valid generated triples is insignificantly higher than the random threshold. All generated and valid triples are unseen. A comparison between different latent space priors, using the $\delta$-VAE method, reveals a decoder collapse.

"The objective of unsupervised graph representation learning (GRL) is to learn a low-dimensional space of node embeddings that reflect the structure of a given unlabeled graph.

"This paper proposes a Disentangled gEnerative cAusal Representation (DEAR) learning method. Unlike existing disentanglement methods that enforce independence of the latent variables, we consider the general case where the underlying factors of interests can be causally correlated. We show that previous methods with independent priors fail to disentangle causally correlated factors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new disentangled learning method called DEAR that enables causal controllable generation and causal representation learning. The key ingredient of this new formulation is to use a structural causal model (SCM) as the prior for a bidirectional generative model. The prior is then trained jointly with a generator and an encoder using a suitable GAN loss incorporated with supervision. We provide theoretical justification on the identifiability and asymptotic consistency of the proposed method, which guarantees disentangled causal representation learning under appropriate conditions. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthesized and real data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of DEAR in causal controllable generation, and the benefits of the learned representations for downstream tasks in terms of sample efficiency and distributional robustness.",0

"Short text clustering has far-reaching effects on semantic analysis, showing its importance for multiple applications such as corpus summarization and information retrieval. However, it inevitably encounters the severe sparsity of short text representations, making the previous clustering approaches still far from satisfactory. In this paper, we present a novel attentive representation learning model for shot text clustering, wherein cluster-level attention is proposed to capture the correlations between text representations and cluster representations. Relying on this, the representation learning and clustering for short texts are seamlessly integrated into a unified model. To further ensure robust model training for short texts, we apply adversarial training to the unsupervised clustering setting, by injecting perturbations into the cluster representations. The model parameters and perturbations are optimized alternately through a minimax game. Extensive experiments on four real-world short text datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over several strong competitors, verifying that robust adversarial training yields substantial performance gains.",0

"Graph representation learning has made major strides over the past decade. However, in many relational domains, the input data are not suited for simple graph representations as the relationships between entities go beyond pairwise interactions. In such cases, the relationships in the data are better represented as hyperedges (set of entities) of a non-uniform hypergraph. While there have been works on principled methods for learning representations of nodes of a hypergraph, these approaches are limited in their applicability to tasks on non-uniform hypergraphs (hyperedges with different cardinalities). In this work, we exploit the incidence structure to develop a hypergraph neural network to learn provably expressive representations of variable sized hyperedges which preserve local-isomorphism in the line graph of the hypergraph, while also being invariant to permutations of its constituent vertices. Specifically, for a given vertex set, we propose frameworks for (1) hyperedge classification and (2) variable sized expansion of partially observed hyperedges which captures the higher order interactions among vertices and hyperedges. We evaluate performance on multiple real-world hypergraph datasets and demonstrate consistent, significant improvement in accuracy, over state-of-the-art models.",0

This research exploits the incidence structure to introduce a hypergraph neural network that learns expressive representations of variable-sized hyperedges while preserving local-isomorphism in the hypergraph's line graph and being invariant to permutations of its constituent vertices. The research proposes frameworks for hyperedge classification and variable-sized expansion of partially observed hyperedges, capturing the higher-order interactions among vertices and hyperedges. The performance evaluation on several real-world hypergraph datasets demonstrates consistent and significant accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art models.",1
"Recent progress in contrastive learning has revolutionized unsupervised representation learning. Concretely, multiple views (augmentations) from the same image are encouraged to map to the similar embeddings, while views from different images are pulled apart. In this paper, through visualizing and diagnosing classification errors, we observe that current contrastive models are ineffective at localizing the foreground object, limiting their ability to extract discriminative high-level features. This is due to the fact that view generation process considers pixels in an image uniformly. To address this problem, we propose a data-driven approach for learning invariance to backgrounds. It first estimates foreground saliency in images and then creates augmentations by copy-and-pasting the foreground onto a variety of backgrounds. The learning still follows the instance discrimination pretext task, so that the representation is trained to disregard background content and focus on the foreground. We study a variety of saliency estimation methods, and find that most methods lead to improvements for contrastive learning. With this approach (DiLo), significant performance is achieved for self-supervised learning on ImageNet classification, and also for object detection on PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.",0
"Unsupervised representation learning has been revolutionized by the recent advancements in contrastive learning. Specifically, augmentations from the same image are encouraged to map to similar embeddings, while those from different images are pulled apart, resulting in multiple views. However, we have observed that current contrastive models fail to effectively localize the foreground object, which limits their ability to extract discriminative high-level features. This is because the view generation process treats all pixels in an image equally. To overcome this issue, we propose a data-driven approach to learn invariance to backgrounds. This involves estimating foreground saliency in images and then creating augmentations by pasting the foreground onto various backgrounds. The instance discrimination pretext task is still followed to train the representation to ignore background content and focus on the foreground. We evaluate various saliency estimation methods and find that most of them improve contrastive learning. Our approach, DiLo, achieves significant performance in self-supervised learning for ImageNet classification, as well as in object detection for PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.",1
"A recent line of work showed that various forms of convolutional kernel methods can be competitive with standard supervised deep convolutional networks on datasets like CIFAR-10, obtaining accuracies in the range of 87-90% while being more amenable to theoretical analysis. In this work, we highlight the importance of a data-dependent feature extraction step that is key to the obtain good performance in convolutional kernel methods. This step typically corresponds to a whitened dictionary of patches, and gives rise to a data-driven convolutional kernel methods. We extensively study its effect, demonstrating it is the key ingredient for high performance of these methods. Specifically, we show that one of the simplest instances of such kernel methods, based on a single layer of image patches followed by a linear classifier is already obtaining classification accuracies on CIFAR-10 in the same range as previous more sophisticated convolutional kernel methods. We scale this method to the challenging ImageNet dataset, showing such a simple approach can exceed all existing non-learned representation methods. This is a new baseline for object recognition without representation learning methods, that initiates the investigation of convolutional kernel models on ImageNet. We conduct experiments to analyze the dictionary that we used, our ablations showing they exhibit low-dimensional properties.",0

"Learning disentangled representations leads to interpretable models and facilitates data generation with style transfer, which has been extensively studied on static data such as images in an unsupervised learning framework. However, only a few works have explored unsupervised disentangled sequential representation learning due to challenges of generating sequential data. In this paper, we propose recurrent Wasserstein Autoencoder (R-WAE), a new framework for generative modeling of sequential data. R-WAE disentangles the representation of an input sequence into static and dynamic factors (i.e., time-invariant and time-varying parts). Our theoretical analysis shows that, R-WAE minimizes an upper bound of a penalized form of the Wasserstein distance between model distribution and sequential data distribution, and simultaneously maximizes the mutual information between input data and different disentangled latent factors, respectively. This is superior to (recurrent) VAE which does not explicitly enforce mutual information maximization between input data and disentangled latent representations. When the number of actions in sequential data is available as weak supervision information, R-WAE is extended to learn a categorical latent representation of actions to improve its disentanglement. Experiments on a variety of datasets show that our models outperform other baselines with the same settings in terms of disentanglement and unconditional video generation both quantitatively and qualitatively.",0

"In the literature of vehicle re-identification (ReID), intensive manual labels such as landmarks, critical parts or semantic segmentation masks are often required to improve the performance. Such extra information helps to detect locally geometric features as a part of representation learning for vehicles.

"Representation learning (RL) methods learn objects' latent embeddings where information is preserved by distances. Since distances are invariant to certain linear transformations, one may obtain different embeddings while preserving the same information. In dynamic systems, a temporal difference in embeddings may be explained by the stability of the system or by the misalignment of embeddings due to arbitrary transformations. In the literature, embedding alignment has not been defined formally, explored theoretically, or analyzed empirically. Here, we explore the embedding alignment and its parts, provide the first formal definitions, propose novel metrics to measure alignment and stability, and show their suitability through synthetic experiments. Real-world experiments show that both static and dynamic RL methods are prone to produce misaligned embeddings and such misalignment worsens the performance of dynamic network inference tasks. By ensuring alignment, the prediction accuracy raises by up to 90% in static and by 40% in dynamic RL methods.",0

"There has been a surge of recent interest in learning representations for graph-structured data. Graph representation learning methods have generally fallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data. The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure. However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work. Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g. GraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc) into a single consistent approach.

"Self-supervised representation learning is able to learn semantically meaningful features; however, much of its recent success relies on multiple crops of an image with very few objects. Instead of learning view-invariant representation from simple images, humans learn representations in a complex world with changing scenes by observing object movement, deformation, pose variation, and ego motion. Motivated by this ability, we present a new self-supervised learning representation framework that can be directly deployed on a video stream of complex scenes with many moving objects. Our framework features a simple flow equivariance objective that encourages the network to predict the features of another frame by applying a flow transformation to the features of the current frame. Our representations, learned from high-resolution raw video, can be readily used for downstream tasks on static images. Readout experiments on challenging semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection benchmarks show that we are able to outperform representations obtained from previous state-of-the-art methods including SimCLR and BYOL.",0

"The dominant paradigm for learning video-text representations -- noise contrastive learning -- increases the similarity of the representations of pairs of samples that are known to be related, such as text and video from the same sample, and pushes away the representations of all other pairs. We posit that this last behaviour is too strict, enforcing dissimilar representations even for samples that are semantically-related -- for example, visually similar videos or ones that share the same depicted action. In this paper, we propose a novel method that alleviates this by leveraging a generative model to naturally push these related samples together: each sample's caption must be reconstructed as a weighted combination of other support samples' visual representations. This simple idea ensures that representations are not overly-specialized to individual samples, are reusable across the dataset, and results in representations that explicitly encode semantics shared between samples, unlike noise contrastive learning. Our proposed method outperforms others by a large margin on MSR-VTT, VATEX and ActivityNet, and MSVD for video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval.",0

"We introduce the novel concept of anti-transfer learning for speech processing with convolutional neural networks. While transfer learning assumes that the learning process for a target task will benefit from re-using representations learned for another task, anti-transfer avoids the learning of representations that have been learned for an orthogonal task, i.e., one that is not relevant and potentially misleading for the target task, such as speaker identity for speech recognition or speech content for emotion recognition. In anti-transfer learning, we penalize similarity between activations of a network being trained and another one previously trained on an orthogonal task, which yields more suitable representations. This leads to better generalization and provides a degree of control over correlations that are spurious or undesirable, e.g. to avoid social bias. We have implemented anti-transfer for convolutional neural networks in different configurations with several similarity metrics and aggregation functions, which we evaluate and analyze with several speech and audio tasks and settings, using six datasets. We show that anti-transfer actually leads to the intended invariance to the orthogonal task and to more appropriate features for the target task at hand. Anti-transfer learning consistently improves classification accuracy in all test cases. While anti-transfer creates computation and memory cost at training time, there is relatively little computation cost when using pre-trained models for orthogonal tasks. Anti-transfer is widely applicable and particularly useful where a specific invariance is desirable or where trained models are available and labeled data for orthogonal tasks are difficult to obtain.",0

"Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable autonomous agents, such as robots, to quickly acquire new behaviors by leveraging prior experience in a set of related training tasks. However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models, which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can \emph{also} perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion signal after only $8$ hours of real world meta-training.

"Recent work on predicting patient outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has focused heavily on the physiological time series data, largely ignoring sparse data such as diagnoses and medications. When they are included, they are usually concatenated in the late stages of a model, which may struggle to learn from rarer disease patterns. Instead, we propose a strategy to exploit diagnoses as relational information by connecting similar patients in a graph. To this end, we propose LSTM-GNN for patient outcome prediction tasks: a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for extracting temporal features and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting the patient neighbourhood information. We demonstrate that LSTM-GNNs outperform the LSTM-only baseline on length of stay prediction tasks on the eICU database.

"Network representation learning (NRL) technique has been successfully adopted in various data mining and machine learning applications. Random walk based NRL is one popular paradigm, which uses a set of random walks to capture the network structural information, and then employs word2vec models to learn the low-dimensional representations. However, until now there is lack of a framework, which unifies existing random walk based NRL models and supports to efficiently learn from large networks. The main obstacle comes from the diverse random walk models and the inefficient sampling method for the random walk generation. In this paper, we first introduce a new and efficient edge sampler based on Metropolis-Hastings sampling technique, and theoretically show the convergence property of the edge sampler to arbitrary discrete probability distributions. Then we propose a random walk model abstraction, in which users can easily define different transition probability by specifying dynamic edge weights and random walk states. The abstraction is efficiently supported by our edge sampler, since our sampler can draw samples from unnormalized probability distribution in constant time complexity. Finally, with the new edge sampler and random walk model abstraction, we carefully implement a scalable NRL framework called UniNet. We conduct comprehensive experiments with five random walk based NRL models over eleven real-world datasets, and the results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of UniNet over billion-edge networks.",0

"Reinforcement Learning has been able to solve many complicated robotics tasks without any need for feature engineering in an end-to-end fashion. However, learning the optimal policy directly from the sensory inputs, i.e the observations, often requires processing and storage of a huge amount of data. In the context of robotics, the cost of data from real robotics hardware is usually very high, thus solutions that achieve high sample-efficiency are needed. We propose a method that aims at learning a mapping from the observations into a lower-dimensional state space. This mapping is learned with unsupervised learning using loss functions shaped to incorporate prior knowledge of the environment and the task. Using the samples from the state space, the optimal policy is quickly and efficiently learned.

"Generating large-scale synthetic data in simulation is a feasible alternative to collecting/labelling real data for training vision-based deep learning models, albeit the modelling inaccuracies do not generalize to the physical world. In this paper, we present a domain-invariant representation learning (DIRL) algorithm to adapt deep models to the physical environment with a small amount of real data. Existing approaches that only mitigate the covariate shift by aligning the marginal distributions across the domains and assume the conditional distributions to be domain-invariant can lead to ambiguous transfer in real scenarios. We propose to jointly align the marginal (input domains) and the conditional (output labels) distributions to mitigate the covariate and the conditional shift across the domains with adversarial learning, and combine it with a triplet distribution loss to make the conditional distributions disjoint in the shared feature space.

"The possibility of generating synthetic data on a large scale through simulation is a viable option for training vision-based deep learning models instead of collecting and labeling real data. However, the inaccuracies in modeling may not apply to the physical world. This paper presents the domain-invariant representation learning (DIRL) algorithm which can adapt deep models to the physical environment with minimal real data. Existing approaches that only address the covariate shift by aligning marginal distributions across domains and assuming the conditional distributions to be domain-invariant can result in uncertain transfer in real-life situations. To mitigate the covariate and conditional shift across domains, the proposed method aligns both the marginal (input domains) and the conditional (output labels) distributions using adversarial learning, and combines it with a triplet distribution loss to separate the conditional distributions in the shared feature space. The experiments conducted on digit domains demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks, while the simulation-to-real transfer of object recognition for vision-based decluttering with a mobile robot increases from 26.8% to 91.0%, resulting in an 86.5% grasping accuracy of various objects.

"We present deep significance clustering (DICE), a framework for jointly performing representation learning and clustering for ""outcome-aware"" stratification. DICE is intended to generate cluster membership that may be used to categorize a population by individual risk level for a targeted outcome. Following the representation learning and clustering steps, we embed the objective function in DICE with a constraint which requires a statistically significant association between the outcome and cluster membership of learned representations. DICE further includes a neural architecture search step to maximize both the likelihood of representation learning and outcome classification accuracy with cluster membership as the predictor. To demonstrate its utility in medicine for patient risk-stratification, the performance of DICE was evaluated using two datasets with different outcome ratios extracted from real-world electronic health records. Outcomes are defined as acute kidney injury (30.4\%) among a cohort of COVID-19 patients, and discharge disposition (36.8\%) among a cohort of heart failure patients, respectively. Extensive results demonstrate that DICE has superior performance as measured by the difference in outcome distribution across clusters, Silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index for clustering, and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for outcome classification compared to several baseline approaches.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in representation learning on graphs and achieved superior performance in tasks such as node classification. However, analyzing heterogeneous graph of different types of nodes and links still brings great challenges for injecting the heterogeneity into a graph neural network. A general remedy is to manually or automatically design meta-paths to transform a heterogeneous graph into a homogeneous graph, but this is suboptimal since the features from the first-order neighbors are not fully leveraged for training and inference. In this paper, we propose simple and effective graph neural networks for heterogeneous graph, excluding the use of meta-paths. Specifically, our models focus on relaxing the heterogeneity stress for model parameters by expanding model capacity of general GNNs in an effective way. Extensive experimental results on six real-world graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed models over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate the potentially good balance between reducing the heterogeneity stress and increasing the parameter size. Our code is freely available for reproducing our results.",0

"The generalization power of deep-learning models is dependent on rich-labelled data. This supervision using large-scaled annotated information is restrictive in most real-world scenarios where data collection and their annotation involve huge cost. Various domain adaptation techniques exist in literature that bridge this distribution discrepancy. However, a majority of these models require the label sets of both the domains to be identical. To tackle a more practical and challenging scenario, we formulate the problem statement from a partial domain adaptation perspective, where the source label set is a super set of the target label set. Driven by the motivation that image styles are private to each domain, in this work, we develop a method that identifies outlier classes exclusively from image content information and train a label classifier exclusively on class-content from source images. Additionally, elimination of negative transfer of samples from classes private to the source domain is achieved by transforming the soft class-level weights into two clusters, 0 (outlier source classes) and 1 (shared classes) by maximizing the between-cluster variance between them.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning is one of the most important problems in machine learning. Recent promising methods are based on contrastive learning. However, contrastive learning often relies on heuristic ideas, and therefore it is not easy to understand what contrastive learning is doing. This paper emphasizes that density ratio estimation is a promising goal for unsupervised representation learning, and promotes understanding to contrastive learning. Our primal contribution is to theoretically show that density ratio estimation unifies three frameworks for unsupervised representation learning: Maximization of mutual information (MI), nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) and a novel framework for estimation of a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace proposed in this paper. This unified view clarifies under what conditions contrastive learning can be regarded as maximizing MI, performing nonlinear ICA or estimating the lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace in the proposed framework. Furthermore, we also make theoretical contributions in each of the three frameworks: We show that MI can be maximized through density ratio estimation under certain conditions, while our analysis for nonlinear ICA reveals a novel insight for recovery of the latent source components, which is clearly supported by numerical experiments. In addition, some theoretical conditions are also established to estimate a nonlinear subspace in the proposed framework. Based on the unified view, we propose two practical methods for unsupervised representation learning through density ratio estimation: The first method is an outlier-robust method for representation learning, while the second one is a sample-efficient nonlinear ICA method. Finally, we numerically demonstrate usefulness of the proposed methods in nonlinear ICA and through application to a downstream task for classification.",0

"We propose a way to learn visual features that are compatible with previously computed ones even when they have different dimensions and are learned via different neural network architectures and loss functions. Compatible means that, if such features are used to compare images, then ""new"" features can be compared directly to ""old"" features, so they can be used interchangeably. This enables visual search systems to bypass computing new features for all previously seen images when updating the embedding models, a process known as backfilling. Backward compatibility is critical to quickly deploy new embedding models that leverage ever-growing large-scale training datasets and improvements in deep learning architectures and training methods. We propose a framework to train embedding models, called backward-compatible training (BCT), as a first step towards backward compatible representation learning. In experiments on learning embeddings for face recognition, models trained with BCT successfully achieve backward compatibility without sacrificing accuracy, thus enabling backfill-free model updates of visual embeddings.",0
"Our proposal offers a method to acquire visual features that are consistent with pre-existing ones, even if they are obtained through different neural network architectures and loss functions and have varying dimensions.

Experiments performed on face recognition embedding models demonstrate the success of our approach in achieving backward compatibility.",1
"Recent advancements in transfer learning have made it a promising approach for domain adaptation via transfer of learned representations. This is especially when relevant when alternate tasks have limited samples of well-defined and labeled data, which is common in the molecule data domain. This makes transfer learning an ideal approach to solve molecular learning tasks. While Adversarial reprogramming has proven to be a successful method to repurpose neural networks for alternate tasks, most works consider source and alternate tasks within the same domain. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, Representation Reprogramming via Dictionary Learning (R2DL), for adversarially reprogramming pretrained language models for molecular learning tasks, motivated by leveraging learned representations in massive state of the art language models. The adversarial program learns a linear transformation between a dense source model input space (language data) and a sparse target model input space (e.g., chemical and biological molecule data) using a k-SVD solver to approximate a sparse representation of the encoded data, via dictionary learning. R2DL achieves the baseline established by state of the art toxicity prediction models trained on domain-specific data and outperforms the baseline in a limited training-data setting, thereby establishing avenues for domain-agnostic transfer learning for tasks with molecule data.",0

"Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at retrieving a person of interest across multiple non-overlapping cameras. With the advancement of deep neural networks and increasing demand of intelligent video surveillance, it has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community. By dissecting the involved components in developing a person Re-ID system, we categorize it into the closed-world and open-world settings. The widely studied closed-world setting is usually applied under various research-oriented assumptions, and has achieved inspiring success using deep learning techniques on a number of datasets. We first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis for closed-world person Re-ID from three different perspectives, including deep feature representation learning, deep metric learning and ranking optimization. With the performance saturation under closed-world setting, the research focus for person Re-ID has recently shifted to the open-world setting, facing more challenging issues. This setting is closer to practical applications under specific scenarios. We summarize the open-world Re-ID in terms of five different aspects. By analyzing the advantages of existing methods, we design a powerful AGW baseline, achieving state-of-the-art or at least comparable performance on twelve datasets for FOUR different Re-ID tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric (mINP) for person Re-ID, indicating the cost for finding all the correct matches, which provides an additional criteria to evaluate the Re-ID system for real applications.

"We present a novel discriminator for GANs that improves realness and diversity of generated samples by learning a structured hypersphere embedding space using spherical circles. The proposed discriminator learns to populate realistic samples around the longest spherical circle, i.e., a great circle, while pushing unrealistic samples toward the poles perpendicular to the great circle. Since longer circles occupy larger area on the hypersphere, they encourage more diversity in representation learning, and vice versa. Discriminating samples based on their corresponding spherical circles can thus naturally induce diversity to generated samples. We also extend the proposed method for conditional settings with class labels by creating a hypersphere for each category and performing class-wise discrimination and update. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness for both unconditional and conditional generation on standard benchmarks, achieving the state of the art.",0

"In value-based reinforcement learning (RL), unlike in supervised learning, the agent faces not a single, stationary, approximation problem, but a sequence of value prediction problems. Each time the policy improves, the nature of the problem changes, shifting both the distribution of states and their values. In this paper we take a novel perspective, arguing that the value prediction problems faced by an RL agent should not be addressed in isolation, but rather as a single, holistic, prediction problem. An RL algorithm generates a sequence of policies that, at least approximately, improve towards the optimal policy. We explicitly characterize the associated sequence of value functions and call it the value-improvement path. Our main idea is to approximate the value-improvement path holistically, rather than to solely track the value function of the current policy. Specifically, we discuss the impact that this holistic view of RL has on representation learning. We demonstrate that a representation that spans the past value-improvement path will also provide an accurate value approximation for future policy improvements. We use this insight to better understand existing approaches to auxiliary tasks and to propose new ones. To test our hypothesis empirically, we augmented a standard deep RL agent with an auxiliary task of learning the value-improvement path. In a study of Atari 2600 games, the augmented agent achieved approximately double the mean and median performance of the baseline agent.",0

"In recent years, ride-hailing services have been increasingly prevalent as they provide huge convenience for passengers. As a fundamental problem, the timely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for effective traffic flow control and route planning. As both spatial and temporal patterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has evolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modeling historical passenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot by connecting region nodes via different relational edges (e.g., origin-destination relationship, geographical distance, etc.). Consequently, the spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in the constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about the directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two connected regions. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to simultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed, and weighted (DDW) graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph representations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with all attention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those three intrinsic properties of DDW graphs, we build three attention layers to fully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across all historical time slots. Moreover, the model employs a subtask to conduct pretraining so that it can obtain accurate results more quickly. We evaluate the proposed model on real-world datasets, and our experimental results demonstrate that Gallat outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",0

"Federated Learning (FL) has been proved to be an effective learning framework when data cannot be centralized due to privacy, communication costs, and regulatory restrictions. When training deep learning models under an FL setting, people employ the predefined model architecture discovered in the centralized environment. However, this predefined architecture may not be the optimal choice because it may not fit data with non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID). Thus, we advocate automating federated learning (AutoFL) to improve model accuracy and reduce the manual design effort. We specifically study AutoFL via Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which can automate the design process. We propose a Federated NAS (FedNAS) algorithm to help scattered workers collaboratively searching for a better architecture with higher accuracy. We also build a system based on FedNAS.

"In order to perform network analysis tasks, representations that capture the most relevant information in the graph structure are needed. However, existing methods do not learn representations that can be interpreted in a straightforward way and that are robust to perturbations to the graph structure. In this work, we address these two limitations by proposing node2coords, a representation learning algorithm for graphs, which learns simultaneously a low-dimensional space and coordinates for the nodes in that space. The patterns that span the low dimensional space reveal the graph's most important structural information. The coordinates of the nodes reveal the proximity of their local structure to the graph structural patterns. In order to measure this proximity by taking into account the underlying graph, we propose to use Wasserstein distances. We introduce an autoencoder that employs a linear layer in the encoder and a novel Wasserstein barycentric layer at the decoder. Node connectivity descriptors, that capture the local structure of the nodes, are passed through the encoder to learn the small set of graph structural patterns. In the decoder, the node connectivity descriptors are reconstructed as Wasserstein barycenters of the graph structural patterns. The optimal weights for the barycenter representation of a node's connectivity descriptor correspond to the coordinates of that node in the low-dimensional space. Experimental results demonstrate that the representations learned with node2coords are interpretable, lead to node embeddings that are stable to perturbations of the graph structure and achieve competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods in node classification.",0

"Representation learning with small labeled data have emerged in many problems, since the success of deep neural networks often relies on the availability of a huge amount of labeled data that is expensive to collect.

"Graphs are often used to organize data because of their simple topological structure, and therefore play a key role in machine learning. And it turns out that the low-dimensional embedded representation obtained by graph representation learning are extremely useful in various typical tasks, such as node classification, content recommendation and link prediction. However, the existing methods mostly start from the microstructure (i.e., the edges) in the graph, ignoring the mesoscopic structure (high-order local structure).

"Representation learning has overcome the often arduous and manual featurization of networks through (unsupervised) feature learning as it results in embeddings that can apply to a variety of downstream learning tasks. The focus of representation learning on graphs has focused mainly on shallow (node-centric) or deep (graph-based) learning approaches. While there have been approaches that work on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks with multi-typed nodes and edges, there is a gap in learning edge representations. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised inductive method called AttrE2Vec, which learns a low-dimensional vector representation for edges in attributed networks. It systematically captures the topological proximity, attributes affinity, and feature similarity of edges. Contrary to current advances in edge embedding research, our proposal extends the body of methods providing representations for edges, capturing graph attributes in an inductive and unsupervised manner. Experimental results show that, compared to contemporary approaches, our method builds more powerful edge vector representations, reflected by higher quality measures (AUC, accuracy) in downstream tasks as edge classification and edge clustering. It is also confirmed by analyzing low-dimensional embedding projections.",0

"Heterogeneous graphs are pervasive in practical scenarios, where each graph consists of multiple types of nodes and edges. Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain low-dimensional node representations that could preserve both node attributes and relation information. However, most of the existing graph convolution approaches were designed for homogeneous graphs, and therefore cannot handle heterogeneous graphs. Some recent methods designed for heterogeneous graphs are also faced with several issues, including the insufficient utilization of heterogeneous properties, structural information loss, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose HGConv, a novel Heterogeneous Graph Convolution approach, to learn comprehensive node representations on heterogeneous graphs with a hybrid micro/macro level convolutional operation. Different from existing methods, HGConv could perform convolutions on the intrinsic structure of heterogeneous graphs directly at both micro and macro levels: A micro-level convolution to learn the importance of nodes within the same relation, and a macro-level convolution to distinguish the subtle difference across different relations. The hybrid strategy enables HGConv to fully leverage heterogeneous information with proper interpretability. Moreover, a weighted residual connection is designed to aggregate both inherent attributes and neighbor information of the focal node adaptively. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate not only the superiority of HGConv over existing methods, but also the intuitive interpretability of our approach for graph analysis.",0

"Given a signed social graph, how can we learn appropriate node representations to infer the signs of missing edges? Signed social graphs have received considerable attention to model trust relationships. Learning node representations is crucial to effectively analyze graph data, and various techniques such as network embedding and graph convolutional network (GCN) have been proposed for learning signed graphs. However, traditional network embedding methods are not end-to-end for a specific task such as link sign prediction, and GCN-based methods suffer from a performance degradation problem when their depth increases. In this paper, we propose Signed Graph Diffusion Network (SGDNet), a novel graph neural network that achieves end-to-end node representation learning for link sign prediction in signed social graphs. We propose a random walk technique specially designed for signed graphs so that SGDNet effectively diffuses hidden node features. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SGDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of link sign prediction accuracy.",0

"The ability to segment teeth precisely from digitized 3D dental models is an essential task in computer-aided orthodontic surgical planning. To date, deep learning based methods have been popularly used to handle this task. State-of-the-art methods directly concatenate the raw attributes of 3D inputs, namely coordinates and normal vectors of mesh cells, to train a single-stream network for fully-automated tooth segmentation. This, however, has the drawback of ignoring the different geometric meanings provided by those raw attributes. This issue might possibly confuse the network in learning discriminative geometric features and result in many isolated false predictions on the dental model. Against this issue, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network (TSGCNet) to learn multi-view geometric information from different geometric attributes. Our TSGCNet adopts two graph-learning streams, designed in an input-aware fashion, to extract more discriminative high-level geometric representations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. These feature representations learned from the designed two different streams are further fused to integrate the multi-view complementary information for the cell-wise dense prediction task. We evaluate our proposed TSGCNet on a real-patient dataset of dental models acquired by 3D intraoral scanners, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for 3D shape segmentation.",0

"Introspection of deep supervised predictive models trained on functional and structural brain imaging may uncover novel markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, supervised training is prone to learning from spurious features (shortcut learning) impairing its value in the discovery process. Deep unsupervised and, recently, contrastive self-supervised approaches, not biased to classification, are better candidates for the task. Their multimodal options specifically offer additional regularization via modality interactions. In this paper, we introduce a way to exhaustively consider multimodal architectures for contrastive self-supervised fusion of fMRI and MRI of AD patients and controls. We show that this multimodal fusion results in representations that improve the results of the downstream classification for both modalities. We investigate the fused self-supervised features projected into the brain space and introduce a numerically stable way to do so.",0

"Deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made progress in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification over the past few years. However, a crucial issue has not been addressed, i.e., the requirement of CNNs for abundant labeled samples versus the insufficient human annotations of PolSAR images. It is well-known that following the supervised learning paradigm may lead to the overfitting of training data, and the lack of supervision information of PolSAR images undoubtedly aggravates this problem, which greatly affects the generalization performance of CNN-based classifiers in large-scale applications. To handle this problem, in this paper, learning transferrable representations from unlabeled PolSAR data through convolutional architectures is explored for the first time. Specifically, a PolSAR-tailored contrastive learning network (PCLNet) is proposed for unsupervised deep PolSAR representation learning and few-shot classification. Different from the utilization of optical processing methods, a diversity stimulation mechanism is constructed to narrow the application gap between optics and PolSAR. Beyond the conventional supervised methods, PCLNet develops an unsupervised pre-training phase based on the proxy objective of instance discrimination to learn useful representations from unlabeled PolSAR data. The acquired representations are transferred to the downstream task, i.e., few-shot PolSAR classification. Experiments on two widely-used PolSAR benchmark datasets confirm the validity of PCLNet. Besides, this work may enlighten how to efficiently utilize the massive unlabeled PolSAR data to alleviate the greedy demands of CNN-based methods for human annotations.",0

"While many approaches exist in the literature to learn low-dimensional representations for data collections in multiple modalities, the generalizability of multi-modal nonlinear embeddings to previously unseen data is a rather overlooked subject. In this work, we first present a theoretical analysis of learning multi-modal nonlinear embeddings in a supervised setting. Our performance bounds indicate that for successful generalization in multi-modal classification and retrieval problems, the regularity of the interpolation functions extending the embedding to the whole data space is as important as the between-class separation and cross-modal alignment criteria. We then propose a multi-modal nonlinear representation learning algorithm that is motivated by these theoretical findings, where the embeddings of the training samples are optimized jointly with the Lipschitz regularity of the interpolators. Experimental comparison to recent multi-modal and single-modal learning algorithms suggests that the proposed method yields promising performance in multi-modal image classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval applications.",0

"Forecasting influenza in a timely manner aids health organizations and policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. However, effective influenza forecasting still remains a challenge despite increasing research interest. It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns of the general population. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-Net, a neural transfer learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the historical model. Thus, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal, adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches.",0

"Self-supervised representation learning is a critical problem in computer vision, as it provides a way to pretrain feature extractors on large unlabeled datasets that can be used as an initialization for more efficient and effective training on downstream tasks. A promising approach is to use contrastive learning to learn a latent space where features are close for similar data samples and far apart for dissimilar ones. This approach has demonstrated tremendous success for pretraining both image and point cloud feature extractors, but it has been barely investigated for multi-modal RGB-D scans, especially with the goal of facilitating high-level scene understanding. To solve this problem, we propose contrasting ""pairs of point-pixel pairs"", where positives include pairs of RGB-D points in correspondence, and negatives include pairs where one of the two modalities has been disturbed and/or the two RGB-D points are not in correspondence. This provides extra flexibility in making hard negatives and helps networks to learn features from both modalities, not just the more discriminating one of the two. Experiments show that this proposed approach yields better performance on three large-scale RGB-D scene understanding benchmarks (ScanNet, SUN RGB-D, and 3RScan) than previous pretraining approaches.",0

"Multi-modal generative models represent an important family of deep models, whose goal is to facilitate representation learning on data with multiple views or modalities. However, current deep multi-modal models focus on the inference of shared representations, while neglecting the important private aspects of data within individual modalities. In this paper, we introduce a disentangled multi-modal variational autoencoder (DMVAE) that utilizes disentangled VAE strategy to separate the private and shared latent spaces of multiple modalities. We specifically consider the instance where the latent factor may be of both continuous and discrete nature, leading to the family of general hybrid DMVAE models. We demonstrate the utility of DMVAE on a semi-supervised learning task, where one of the modalities contains partial data labels, both relevant and irrelevant to the other modality. Our experiments on several benchmarks indicate the importance of the private-shared disentanglement as well as the hybrid latent representation.",0

"As the role played by statistical and computational sciences in climate and environmental modelling and prediction becomes more important, Machine Learning researchers are becoming more aware of the relevance of their work to help tackle the climate crisis. Indeed, being universal nonlinear function approximation tools, Machine Learning algorithms are efficient in analysing and modelling spatially and temporally variable environmental data. While Deep Learning models have proved to be able to capture spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal dependencies through their automatic feature representation learning, the problem of the interpolation of continuous spatio-temporal fields measured on a set of irregular points in space is still under-investigated. To fill this gap, we introduce here a framework for spatio-temporal prediction of climate and environmental data using deep learning. Specifically, we show how spatio-temporal processes can be decomposed in terms of a sum of products of temporally referenced basis functions, and of stochastic spatial coefficients which can be spatially modelled and mapped on a regular grid, allowing the reconstruction of the complete spatio-temporal signal. Applications on two case studies based on simulated and real-world data will show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in modelling coherent spatio-temporal fields.",0

"Graphs as a type of data structure have recently attracted significant attention. Representation learning of geometric graphs has achieved great success in many fields including molecular, social, and financial networks. It is natural to present proteins as graphs in which nodes represent the residues and edges represent the pairwise interactions between residues. However, 3D protein structures have rarely been studied as graphs directly. The challenges include: 1) Proteins are complex macromolecules composed of thousands of atoms making them much harder to model than micro-molecules. 2) Capturing the long-range pairwise relations for protein structure modeling remains under-explored. 3) Few studies have focused on learning the different attributes of proteins together. To address the above challenges, we propose a new graph neural network architecture to represent the proteins as 3D graphs and predict both distance geometric graph representation and dihedral geometric graph representation together. This gives a significant advantage because this network opens a new path from the sequence to structure. We conducted extensive experiments on four different datasets and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0

"Learning image representations without human supervision is an important and active research field. Several recent approaches have successfully leveraged the idea of making such a representation invariant under different types of perturbations, especially via contrastive-based instance discrimination training. Although effective visual representations should indeed exhibit such invariances, there are other important characteristics, such as encoding contextual reasoning skills, for which alternative reconstruction-based approaches might be better suited.   With this in mind, we propose a teacher-student scheme to learn representations by training a convnet to reconstruct a bag-of-visual-words (BoW) representation of an image, given as input a perturbed version of that same image. Our strategy performs an online training of both the teacher network (whose role is to generate the BoW targets) and the student network (whose role is to learn representations), along with an online update of the visual-words vocabulary (used for the BoW targets). This idea effectively enables fully online BoW-guided unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the interest of our BoW-based strategy which surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods (including contrastive-based ones) in several applications. For instance, in downstream tasks such Pascal object detection, Pascal classification and Places205 classification, our method improves over all prior unsupervised approaches, thus establishing new state-of-the-art results that are also significantly better even than those of supervised pre-training.

"Time series classification problems exist in many fields and have been explored for a couple of decades. However, they still remain challenging, and their solutions need to be further improved for real-world applications in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid neural architecture, called Self-Attentive Recurrent Convolutional Networks (SARCoN), to learn multi-faceted representations for univariate time series. SARCoN is the synthesis of long short-term memory networks with self-attentive mechanisms and Fully Convolutional Networks, which work in parallel to learn the representations of univariate time series from different perspectives. The component modules of the proposed architecture are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner and they classify the input time series in a cooperative way.

Our experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches for time series classification, the proposed architecture can achieve remarkable improvements for a set of univariate time series benchmarks from the UCR repository. Moreover, the self-attention and the global average pooling in the proposed architecture enable visible interpretability by facilitating the identification of the contribution regions of the original time series. An overall analysis confirms that multi-faceted representations of time series aid in capturing deep temporal corrections within complex time series, which is essential for the improvement of time series classification performance.

"Mesh is a powerful data structure for 3D shapes. Representation learning for 3D meshes is important in many computer vision and graphics applications. The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for structured data (e.g., images) suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN for 3D shapes. However, 3D shape data are irregular since each node's neighbors are unordered. Various graph neural networks for 3D shapes have been developed with isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems to overcome the node inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems limit the representation power. In this paper, we propose a local structure-aware anisotropic convolutional operation (LSA-Conv) that learns adaptive weighting matrices for each node according to the local neighboring structure and performs shared anisotropic filters. In fact, the learnable weighting matrix is similar to the attention matrix in the random synthesizer -- a new Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP).

"Context modeling is one of the most fertile subfields of visual recognition which aims at designing discriminant image representations while incorporating their intrinsic and extrinsic relationships. However, the potential of context modeling is currently underexplored and most of the existing solutions are either context-free or restricted to simple handcrafted geometric relationships. We introduce in this paper DHCN: a novel Deep Hierarchical Context Network that leverages different sources of contexts including geometric and semantic relationships. The proposed method is based on the minimization of an objective function mixing a fidelity term, a context criterion and a regularizer. The solution of this objective function defines the architecture of a bi-level hierarchical context network; the first level of this network captures scene geometry while the second one corresponds to semantic relationships. We solve this representation learning problem by training its underlying deep network whose parameters correspond to the most influencing bi-level contextual relationships and we evaluate its performances on image annotation using the challenging ImageCLEF benchmark.",0

This mechanism enables the central node to learn a hop-wise neighborhood mixing that can be applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Experimental results on five benchmarks show the competitive performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art GNNs, e.g., up to 13K faster in terms of time cost per training epoch on large heterogeneous graphs.",0
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool for graph representation learning; however, most existing GNN methods are designed to work with only homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs. This paper proposes a novel approach called the Hop-Hop Relation-aware Graph Neural Network (HHR-GNN), which aims to unify representation learning for both types of graphs. HHR-GNN leverages knowledge graph embedding to learn relation scores between central nodes' representations at different hops, enabling the learning of a personalized receptive field for each node. Our model also simultaneously allows for hop-aware projection and aggregation in neighborhood aggregation, facilitating hop-wise neighborhood mixing for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that HHR-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs, achieving up to 13K faster training time per epoch on large, heterogeneous graphs.",1
"The graph Laplacian regularization term is usually used in semi-supervised representation learning to provide graph structure information for a model $f(X)$. However, with the recent popularity of graph neural networks (GNNs), directly encoding graph structure $A$ into a model, i.e., $f(A, X)$, has become the more common approach. While we show that graph Laplacian regularization brings little-to-no benefit to existing GNNs, and propose a simple but non-trivial variant of graph Laplacian regularization, called Propagation-regularization (P-reg), to boost the performance of existing GNN models. We provide formal analyses to show that P-reg not only infuses extra information (that is not captured by the traditional graph Laplacian regularization) into GNNs, but also has the capacity equivalent to an infinite-depth graph convolutional network. We demonstrate that P-reg can effectively boost the performance of existing GNN models on both node-level and graph-level tasks across many different datasets.",0

"Knowledge Graphs have been one of the fundamental methods for integrating heterogeneous data sources. Integrating heterogeneous data sources is crucial, especially in the biomedical domain, where central data-driven tasks such as drug discovery rely on incorporating information from different biomedical databases. These databases contain various biological entities and relations such as proteins (PDB), genes (Gene Ontology), drugs (DrugBank), diseases (DDB), and protein-protein interactions (BioGRID). The process of semantically integrating heterogeneous biomedical databases is often riddled with imperfections. The quality of data-driven drug discovery relies on the accuracy of the mining methods used and the data's quality as well. Thus, having complete and refined biomedical knowledge graphs is central to achieving more accurate drug discovery outcomes. Here we propose using the latest graph representation learning and embedding models to refine and complete biomedical knowledge graphs. This preliminary work demonstrates learning discrete representations of the integrated biomedical knowledge graph Chem2Bio2RD [3]. We perform a knowledge graph completion and refinement task using a simple top-K cosine similarity measure between the learned embedding vectors to predict missing links between drugs and targets present in the data. We show that this simple procedure can be used alternatively to binary classifiers in link prediction.",0

"Both high-level and high-resolution feature representations are of great importance in various visual understanding tasks. To acquire high-resolution feature maps with high-level semantic information, one common strategy is to adopt dilated convolutions in the backbone networks to extract high-resolution feature maps, such as the dilatedFCN-based methods for semantic segmentation. However, due to many convolution operations are conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, such methods have large computational complexity and memory consumption. In this paper, we propose one novel holistically-guided decoder which is introduced to obtain the high-resolution semantic-rich feature maps via the multi-scale features from the encoder. The decoding is achieved via novel holistic codeword generation and codeword assembly operations, which take advantages of both the high-level and low-level features from the encoder features. With the proposed holistically-guided decoder, we implement the EfficientFCN architecture for semantic segmentation and HGD-FPN for object detection and instance segmentation. The EfficientFCN achieves comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods with only 1/3 of their computational costs for semantic segmentation on PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC, ADE20K datasets. Meanwhile, the proposed HGD-FPN achieves $>2\%$ higher mean Average Precision (mAP) when integrated into several object detection frameworks with ResNet-50 encoding backbones.",0

"Contrastive learning between multiple views of the data has recently achieved state of the art performance in the field of self-supervised representation learning. Despite its success, the influence of different view choices has been less studied. In this paper, we use theoretical and empirical analysis to better understand the importance of view selection, and argue that we should reduce the mutual information (MI) between views while keeping task-relevant information intact. To verify this hypothesis, we devise unsupervised and semi-supervised frameworks that learn effective views by aiming to reduce their MI. We also consider data augmentation as a way to reduce MI, and show that increasing data augmentation indeed leads to decreasing MI and improves downstream classification accuracy. As a by-product, we achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy on unsupervised pre-training for ImageNet classification ($73\%$ top-1 linear readout with a ResNet-50). In addition, transferring our models to PASCAL VOC object detection and COCO instance segmentation consistently outperforms supervised pre-training. Code:http://github.com/HobbitLong/PyContrast",0

"Visual tempo, which describes how fast an action goes, has shown its potential in supervised action recognition. In this work, we demonstrate that visual tempo can also serve as a self-supervision signal for video representation learning. We propose to maximize the mutual information between representations of slow and fast videos via hierarchical contrastive learning (VTHCL). Specifically, by sampling the same instance at slow and fast frame rates respectively, we can obtain slow and fast video frames which share the same semantics but contain different visual tempos. Video representations learned from VTHCL achieve the competitive performances under the self-supervision evaluation protocol for action recognition on UCF-101 (82.1\%) and HMDB-51 (49.2\%). Moreover, comprehensive experiments suggest that the learned representations are generalized well to other downstream tasks including action detection on AVA and action anticipation on Epic-Kitchen.

"Message passing neural networks have recently evolved into a state-of-the-art approach to representation learning on graphs. Existing methods perform synchronous message passing along all edges in multiple subsequent rounds and consequently suffer from various shortcomings: Propagation schemes are inflexible since they are restricted to $k$-hop neighborhoods and insensitive to actual demands of information propagation. Further, long-range dependencies cannot be modeled adequately and learned representations are based on correlations of fixed locality. These issues prevent existing methods from reaching their full potential in terms of prediction performance. Instead, we consider a novel asynchronous message passing approach where information is pushed only along the most relevant edges until convergence. Our proposed algorithm can equivalently be formulated as a single synchronous message passing iteration using a suitable neighborhood function, thus sharing the advantages of existing methods while addressing their central issues. The resulting neural network utilizes a node-adaptive receptive field derived from meaningful sparse node neighborhoods. In addition, by learning and combining node representations over differently sized neighborhoods, our model is able to capture correlations on multiple scales. We further propose variants of our base model with different inductive bias. Empirical results are provided for semi-supervised node classification on five real-world datasets following a rigorous evaluation protocol. We find that our models outperform competitors on all datasets in terms of accuracy with statistical significance. In some cases, our models additionally provide faster runtime.",0

"Many unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (ReID) approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with feature fine-tuning. However, because of domain gap, the pseudo-labels are not always reliable and there are noisy/incorrect labels. This would mislead the feature representation learning and deteriorate the performance. In this paper, we propose to estimate and exploit the credibility of the assigned pseudo-label of each sample to alleviate the influence of noisy labels, by suppressing the contribution of noisy samples. We build our baseline framework using the mean teacher method together with an additional contrastive loss. We have observed that a sample with a wrong pseudo-label through clustering in general has a weaker consistency between the output of the mean teacher model and the student model. Based on this finding, we propose to exploit the uncertainty (measured by consistency levels) to evaluate the reliability of the pseudo-label of a sample and incorporate the uncertainty to re-weight its contribution within various ReID losses, including the identity (ID) classification loss per sample, the triplet loss, and the contrastive loss. Our uncertainty-guided optimization brings significant improvement and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.",0

"One significant factor we expect the video representation learning to capture, especially in contrast with the image representation learning, is the object motion. However, we found that in the current mainstream video datasets, some action categories are highly related with the scene where the action happens, making the model tend to degrade to a solution where only the scene information is encoded. For example, a trained model may predict a video as playing football simply because it sees the field, neglecting that the subject is dancing as a cheerleader on the field. This is against our original intention towards the video representation learning and may bring scene bias on different dataset that can not be ignored. In order to tackle this problem, we propose to decouple the scene and the motion (DSM) with two simple operations, so that the model attention towards the motion information is better paid. Specifically, we construct a positive clip and a negative clip for each video. Compared to the original video, the positive/negative is motion-untouched/broken but scene-broken/untouched by Spatial Local Disturbance and Temporal Local Disturbance. Our objective is to pull the positive closer while pushing the negative farther to the original clip in the latent space. In this way, the impact of the scene is weakened while the temporal sensitivity of the network is further enhanced. We conduct experiments on two tasks with various backbones and different pre-training datasets, and find that our method surpass the SOTA methods with a remarkable 8.1% and 8.8% improvement towards action recognition task on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets respectively using the same backbone.",0
"We anticipate that video representation learning will capture object motion, which is a significant factor that sets it apart from image representation learning. However, we have observed that certain action categories in mainstream video datasets are closely linked to the scene where the action occurs, leading the model to encode only scene information. For example, a model may identify a video as featuring football because it sees a field, disregarding the fact that a cheerleader is dancing on the field. This is not our intended outcome for video representation learning and can introduce scene bias in other datasets. To remedy this issue, we propose decoupling scene and motion through two simple operations called DSM. We create a positive and negative clip for each video that are motion-untouched/broken but scene-broken/untouched using Spatial Local Disturbance and Temporal Local Disturbance. Our goal is to bring the positive clip closer and push the negative clip farther from the original clip in the latent space. By doing so, we can weaken scene impact and enhance the network's temporal sensitivity.

"Generative adversarial networks are the state of the art approach towards learned synthetic image generation. Although early successes were mostly unsupervised, bit by bit, this trend has been superseded by approaches based on labelled data. These supervised methods allow a much finer-grained control of the output image, offering more flexibility and stability. Nevertheless, the main drawback of such models is the necessity of annotated data. In this work, we introduce an novel framework that benefits from two popular learning techniques, adversarial training and representation learning, and takes a step towards unsupervised conditional GANs. In particular, our approach exploits the structure of a latent space (learned by the representation learning) and employs it to condition the generative model. In this way, we break the traditional dependency between condition and label, substituting the latter by unsupervised features coming from the latent space. Finally, we show that this new technique is able to produce samples on demand keeping the quality of its supervised counterpart.",0

To address this issue, we present a novel framework that combines adversarial training and representation learning to create unsupervised conditional GANs. Our approach utilizes the latent space structure learned through representation learning to condition the generative model, breaking the traditional dependency on labeled data. We demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality images on demand, comparable to those produced by supervised models.",1
"Identification of 3D cephalometric landmarks that serve as proxy to the shape of human skull is the fundamental step in cephalometric analysis. Since manual landmarking from 3D computed tomography (CT) images is a cumbersome task even for the trained experts, automatic 3D landmark detection system is in a great need. Recently, automatic landmarking of 2D cephalograms using deep learning (DL) has achieved great success, but 3D landmarking for more than 80 landmarks has not yet reached a satisfactory level, because of the factors hindering machine learning such as the high dimensionality of the input data and limited amount of training data due to ethical restrictions on the use of medical data. This paper presents a semi-supervised DL method for 3D landmarking that takes advantage of anonymized landmark dataset with paired CT data being removed. The proposed method first detects a small number of easy-to-find reference landmarks, then uses them to provide a rough estimation of the entire landmarks by utilizing the low dimensional representation learned by variational autoencoder (VAE). Anonymized landmark dataset is used for training the VAE. Finally, coarse-to-fine detection is applied to the small bounding box provided by rough estimation, using separate strategies suitable for mandible and cranium. For mandibular landmarks, patch-based 3D CNN is applied to the segmented image of the mandible (separated from the maxilla), in order to capture 3D morphological features of mandible associated with the landmarks. We detect 6 landmarks around the condyle all at once, instead of one by one, because they are closely related to each other. For cranial landmarks, we again use VAE-based latent representation for more accurate annotation. In our experiment, the proposed method achieved an averaged 3D point-to-point error of 2.91 mm for 90 landmarks only with 15 paired training data.",0

"A molecular and cellular understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 variably infects and causes severe COVID-19 remains a bottleneck in developing interventions to end the pandemic. We sought to use deep learning to study the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity by identifying transcriptomic patterns and cell types associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. To do this, we developed a new approach to generating self-supervised edge features.

"Disentangled representation learning has seen a surge in interest over recent times, generally focusing on new models which optimise one of many disparate disentanglement metrics. Symmetry Based Disentangled Representation learning introduced a robust mathematical framework that defined precisely what is meant by a ""linear disentangled representation"". This framework determined that such representations would depend on a particular decomposition of the symmetry group acting on the data, showing that actions would manifest through irreducible group representations acting on independent representational subspaces. Caselles-Dupre et al [2019] subsequently proposed the first model to induce and demonstrate a linear disentangled representation in a VAE model. In this work we empirically show that linear disentangled representations are not generally present in standard VAE models and that they instead require altering the loss landscape to induce them. We proceed to show that such representations are a desirable property with regard to classical disentanglement metrics. Finally we propose a method to induce irreducible representations which forgoes the need for labelled action sequences, as was required by prior work. We explore a number of properties of this method, including the ability to learn from action sequences without knowledge of intermediate states and robustness under visual noise. We also demonstrate that it can successfully learn 4 independent symmetries directly from pixels.",0

"Deep clustering is a fundamental yet challenging task for data analysis. Recently we witness a strong tendency of combining autoencoder and graph neural networks to exploit structure information for clustering performance enhancement. However, we observe that existing literature 1) lacks a dynamic fusion mechanism to selectively integrate and refine the information of graph structure and node attributes for consensus representation learning; 2) fails to extract information from both sides for robust target distribution (i.e., ""groundtruth"" soft labels) generation. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Deep Fusion Clustering Network (DFCN). Specifically, in our network, an interdependency learning-based Structure and Attribute Information Fusion (SAIF) module is proposed to explicitly merge the representations learned by an autoencoder and a graph autoencoder for consensus representation learning. Also, a reliable target distribution generation measure and a triplet self-supervision strategy, which facilitate cross-modality information exploitation, are designed for network training. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the proposed DFCN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods.",0

"Video recognition has been advanced in recent years by benchmarks with rich annotations. However, research is still mainly limited to human action or sports recognition - focusing on a highly specific video understanding task and thus leaving a significant gap towards describing the overall content of a video. We fill this gap by presenting a large-scale ""Holistic Video Understanding Dataset""~(HVU). HVU is organized hierarchically in a semantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-label and multi-task video understanding as a comprehensive problem that encompasses the recognition of multiple semantic aspects in the dynamic scene. HVU contains approx.~572k videos in total with 9 million annotations for training, validation, and test set spanning over 3142 labels. HVU encompasses semantic aspects defined on categories of scenes, objects, actions, events, attributes, and concepts which naturally captures the real-world scenarios.   We demonstrate the generalization capability of HVU on three challenging tasks: 1.) Video classification, 2.) Video captioning and 3.) Video clustering tasks. In particular for video classification, we introduce a new spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture called ""Holistic Appearance and Temporal Network""~(HATNet) that builds on fusing 2D and 3D architectures into one by combining intermediate representations of appearance and temporal cues. HATNet focuses on the multi-label and multi-task learning problem and is trained in an end-to-end manner.

"The effective application of representation learning to real-world problems requires both techniques for learning useful representations, and also robust ways to evaluate properties of representations. Recent work in disentangled representation learning has shown that unsupervised representation learning approaches rely on fully supervised disentanglement metrics, which assume access to labels for ground-truth factors of variation. In many real-world cases ground-truth factors are expensive to collect, or difficult to model, such as for perception. Here we empirically show that a weakly-supervised downstream task based on odd-one-out observations is suitable for model selection by observing high correlation on a difficult downstream abstract visual reasoning task. We also show that a bespoke metric-learning VAE model which performs highly on this task also out-performs other standard unsupervised and a weakly-supervised disentanglement model across several metrics.",0

"The success of deep learning based models for computer vision applications requires large scale human annotated data which are often expensive to generate.

In this study, we present a self-supervised learning strategy to acquire transferable features from MR video clips by requiring the model to learn anatomical features. The pretext task models are created to predict the correct sequence of jumbled image patches that the MR video frames are divided into. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide an explanation for the decisions made by the models on MR video data, as none of the supervised learning models for injury classification task from MR video have done so. Our proposed approach's experiments on the pretext task reveal that the model can obtain spatial context invariant features, which help achieve reliable and explainable performance in downstream tasks, such as ACL tear injury classification from knee MRI. The experimental results obtained in the downstream task indicate the effectiveness of the novel Convolutional Neural Network proposed in this paper.",1
"Graph representation learning has many real-world applications, from super-resolution imaging, 3D computer vision to drug repurposing, protein classification, social networks analysis. An adequate representation of graph data is vital to the learning performance of a statistical or machine learning model for graph-structured data. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale representation system for graph data, called decimated framelets, which form a localized tight frame on the graph. The decimated framelet system allows storage of the graph data representation on a coarse-grained chain and processes the graph data at multi scales where at each scale, the data is stored at a subgraph. Based on this, we then establish decimated G-framelet transforms for the decomposition and reconstruction of the graph data at multi resolutions via a constructive data-driven filter bank. The graph framelets are built on a chain-based orthonormal basis that supports fast graph Fourier transforms. From this, we give a fast algorithm for the decimated G-framelet transforms, or FGT, that has linear computational complexity O(N) for a graph of size N. The theory of decimated framelets and FGT is verified with numerical examples for random graphs. The effectiveness is demonstrated by real-world applications, including multiresolution analysis for traffic network, and graph neural networks for graph classification tasks.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a framework for graph representation learning, where a model learns to generate low dimensional node embeddings that encapsulate structural and feature-related information. GNNs are usually trained in an end-to-end fashion, leading to highly specialized node embeddings. However, generating node embeddings that can be used to perform multiple tasks (with performance comparable to single-task models) is an open problem. We propose a novel meta-learning strategy capable of producing multi-task node embeddings. Our method avoids the difficulties arising when learning to perform multiple tasks concurrently by, instead, learning to quickly (i.e. with a few steps of gradient descent) adapt to multiple tasks singularly. We show that the embeddings produced by our method can be used to perform multiple tasks with comparable or higher performance than classically trained models. Our method is model-agnostic and task-agnostic, thus applicable to a wide variety of multi-task domains.",0

"Events in the real world are correlated across nearby points in time, and we must learn from this temporally smooth data. However, when neural networks are trained to categorize or reconstruct single items, the common practice is to randomize the order of training items. What are the effects of temporally smooth training data on the efficiency of learning? We first tested the effects of smoothness in training data on incremental learning in feedforward nets and found that smoother data slowed learning. Moreover, sampling so as to minimize temporal smoothness produced more efficient learning than sampling randomly. If smoothness generally impairs incremental learning, then how can networks be modified to benefit from smoothness in the training data? We hypothesized that two simple brain-inspired mechanisms, leaky memory in activation units and memory-gating, could enable networks to rapidly extract useful representations from smooth data. Across all levels of data smoothness, these brain-inspired architectures achieved more efficient category learning than feedforward networks. This advantage persisted, even when leaky memory networks with gating were trained on smooth data and tested on randomly-ordered data. Finally, we investigated how these brain-inspired mechanisms altered the internal representations learned by the networks. We found that networks with multi-scale leaky memory and memory-gating could learn internal representations that un-mixed data sources which vary on fast and slow timescales across training samples. Altogether, we identified simple mechanisms enabling neural networks to learn more quickly from temporally smooth data, and to generate internal representations that separate timescales in the training signal.",0

"A novel unsupervised deep learning method is developed to identify individual-specific large scale brain functional networks (FNs) from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) in an end-to-end learning fashion.

"Low-dimension graph embeddings have proved extremely useful in various downstream tasks in large graphs, e.g., link-related content recommendation and node classification tasks, etc. Most existing embedding approaches take nodes as the basic unit for information aggregation, e.g., node perception fields in GNN or con-textual nodes in random walks. The main drawback raised by such node-view is its lack of support for expressing the compound relationships between nodes, which results in the loss of a certain degree of graph information during embedding. To this end, this paper pro-poses PairE(Pair Embedding), a solution to use ""pair"", a higher level unit than a ""node"" as the core for graph embeddings. Accordingly, a multi-self-supervised auto-encoder is designed to fulfill two pretext tasks, to reconstruct the feature distribution for respective pairs and their surrounding context. PairE has three major advantages: 1) Informative, embedding beyond node-view are capable to preserve richer information of the graph; 2) Simple, the solutions provided by PairE are time-saving, storage-efficient, and require the fewer hyper-parameters; 3) High adaptability, with the introduced translator operator to map pair embeddings to the node embeddings, PairE can be effectively used in both the link-based and the node-based graph analysis. Experiment results show that PairE consistently outperforms the state of baselines in all four downstream tasks, especially with significant edges in the link-prediction and multi-label node classification tasks.",0

"Recent years have witnessed the emergence and flourishing of hierarchical graph pooling neural networks (HGPNNs) which are effective graph representation learning approaches for graph level tasks such as graph classification. However, current HGPNNs do not take full advantage of the graph's intrinsic structures (e.g., community structure). Moreover, the pooling operations in existing HGPNNs are difficult to be interpreted. In this paper, we propose a new interpretable graph pooling framework - CommPOOL, that can capture and preserve the hierarchical community structure of graphs in the graph representation learning process. Specifically, the proposed community pooling mechanism in CommPOOL utilizes an unsupervised approach for capturing the inherent community structure of graphs in an interpretable manner. CommPOOL is a general and flexible framework for hierarchical graph representation learning that can further facilitate various graph-level tasks. Evaluations on five public benchmark datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of CommPOOL in graph representation learning for graph classification compared to the state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its effectiveness in capturing and preserving the community structure of graphs.",0

"One of the key factors of enabling machine learning models to comprehend and solve real-world tasks is to leverage multimodal data. Unfortunately, annotation of multimodal data is challenging and expensive. Recently, self-supervised multimodal methods that combine vision and language were proposed to learn multimodal representations without annotation. However, these methods often choose to ignore the presence of high levels of noise and thus yield sub-optimal results. In this work, we show that the problem of noise estimation for multimodal data can be reduced to a multimodal density estimation task. Using multimodal density estimation, we propose a noise estimation building block for multimodal representation learning that is based strictly on the inherent correlation between different modalities. We demonstrate how our noise estimation can be broadly integrated and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art performance on five different benchmark datasets for two challenging multimodal tasks: Video Question Answering and Text-To-Video Retrieval. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical probabilistic error bound substantiating our empirical results and analyze failure cases. Code: https://github.com/elad-amrani/ssml.",0

"Learning joint embedding space for various modalities is of vital importance for multimodal fusion. Mainstream modality fusion approaches fail to achieve this goal, leaving a modality gap which heavily affects cross-modal fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial encoder-decoder-classifier framework to learn a modality-invariant embedding space. Since the distributions of various modalities vary in nature, to reduce the modality gap, we translate the distributions of source modalities into that of target modality via their respective encoders using adversarial training. Furthermore, we exert additional constraints on embedding space by introducing reconstruction loss and classification loss. Then we fuse the encoded representations using hierarchical graph neural network which explicitly explores unimodal, bimodal and trimodal interactions in multi-stage. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

"Floorplans are commonly used to represent the layout of buildings. In computer aided-design (CAD) floorplans are usually represented in the form of hierarchical graph structures.

"In this paper, we propose Text-Aware Pre-training (TAP) for Text-VQA and Text-Caption tasks. These two tasks aim at reading and understanding scene text in images for question answering and image caption generation, respectively. In contrast to the conventional vision-language pre-training that fails to capture scene text and its relationship with the visual and text modalities, TAP explicitly incorporates scene text (generated from OCR engines) in pre-training. With three pre-training tasks, including masked language modeling (MLM), image-text (contrastive) matching (ITM), and relative (spatial) position prediction (RPP), TAP effectively helps the model learn a better aligned representation among the three modalities: text word, visual object, and scene text. Due to this aligned representation learning, even pre-trained on the same downstream task dataset, TAP already boosts the absolute accuracy on the TextVQA dataset by +5.4%, compared with a non-TAP baseline. To further improve the performance, we build a large-scale dataset based on the Conceptual Caption dataset, named OCR-CC, which contains 1.4 million scene text-related image-text pairs. Pre-trained on this OCR-CC dataset, our approach outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple tasks, i.e., +8.3% accuracy on TextVQA, +8.6% accuracy on ST-VQA, and +10.2 CIDEr score on TextCaps.",0

"Contrastive self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach to unsupervised visual representation learning. In general, these methods learn global (image-level) representations that are invariant to different views (i.e., compositions of data augmentation) of the same image. However, many visual understanding tasks require dense (pixel-level) representations. In this paper, we propose View-Agnostic Dense Representation (VADeR) for unsupervised learning of dense representations. VADeR learns pixelwise representations by forcing local features to remain constant over different viewing conditions. Specifically, this is achieved through pixel-level contrastive learning: matching features (that is, features that describes the same location of the scene on different views) should be close in an embedding space, while non-matching features should be apart. VADeR provides a natural representation for dense prediction tasks and transfers well to downstream tasks. Our method outperforms ImageNet supervised pretraining (and strong unsupervised baselines) in multiple dense prediction tasks.",0

As revealed by recent studies, heavy data augmentation and large sets of negatives are both crucial in learning such representations. At the same time, data mixing strategies either at the image or the feature level improve both supervised and semi-supervised learning by synthesizing novel examples, forcing networks to learn more robust features. In this paper, we argue that an important aspect of contrastive learning, i.e., the effect of hard negatives, has so far been neglected. To get more meaningful negative samples, current top contrastive self-supervised learning approaches either substantially increase the batch sizes, or keep very large memory banks; increasing the memory size, however, leads to diminishing returns in terms of performance. We therefore start by delving deeper into a top-performing framework and show evidence that harder negatives are needed to facilitate better and faster learning. Based on these observations, and motivated by the success of data mixing, we propose hard negative mixing strategies at the feature level, that can be computed on-the-fly with a minimal computational overhead. We exhaustively ablate our approach on linear classification, object detection and instance segmentation and show that employing our hard negative mixing procedure improves the quality of visual representations learned by a state-of-the-art self-supervised learning method.",0
"Self-supervised learning approaches for computer vision now rely heavily on contrastive learning as a key component. This involves training visual representations by embedding two augmented versions of the same image close to each other while pushing apart the embeddings of different images. Recent studies have shown that effective contrastive learning requires heavy data augmentation and large sets of negatives. Data mixing strategies, either at the image or feature level, have also been found to improve supervised and semi-supervised learning. However, the importance of hard negatives in contrastive learning has been overlooked. To address this, we propose a hard negative mixing strategy at the feature level. This approach provides more meaningful negative samples and facilitates better and faster learning without requiring an increase in memory size. Our exhaustive ablation study shows that our approach improves the quality of visual representations learned by a state-of-the-art self-supervised learning method in linear classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.",1
"Deep model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to substantially improve the sample-efficiency of deep RL. While various challenges have long held it back, a number of papers have recently come out reporting success with deep model-based methods. This is a great development, but the lack of a consistent metric to evaluate such methods makes it difficult to compare various approaches. For example, the common single-task sample-efficiency metric conflates improvements due to model-based learning with various other aspects, such as representation learning, making it difficult to assess true progress on model-based RL. To address this, we introduce an experimental setup to evaluate model-based behavior of RL methods, inspired by work from neuroscience on detecting model-based behavior in humans and animals. Our metric based on this setup, the Local Change Adaptation (LoCA) regret, measures how quickly an RL method adapts to a local change in the environment. Our metric can identify model-based behavior, even if the method uses a poor representation and provides insight in how close a method's behavior is from optimal model-based behavior. We use our setup to evaluate the model-based behavior of MuZero on a variation of the classic Mountain Car task.",0

"We study a general class of contextual bandits, where each context-action pair is associated with a raw feature vector, but the reward generating function is unknown. We propose a novel learning algorithm that transforms the raw feature vector using the last hidden layer of a deep ReLU neural network (deep representation learning), and uses an upper confidence bound (UCB) approach to explore in the last linear layer (shallow exploration). We prove that under standard assumptions, our proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ finite-time regret, where $T$ is the learning time horizon.

"Variational mutual information (MI) estimators are widely used in unsupervised representation learning methods such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC). A lower bound on MI can be obtained from a multi-class classification problem, where a critic attempts to distinguish a positive sample drawn from the underlying joint distribution from $(m-1)$ negative samples drawn from a suitable proposal distribution. Using this approach, MI estimates are bounded above by $\log m$, and could thus severely underestimate unless $m$ is very large. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel estimator based on a multi-label classification problem, where the critic needs to jointly identify multiple positive samples at the same time. We show that using the same amount of negative samples, multi-label CPC is able to exceed the $\log m$ bound, while still being a valid lower bound of mutual information. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to lead to better mutual information estimation, gain empirical improvements in unsupervised representation learning, and beat a current state-of-the-art knowledge distillation method over 10 out of 13 tasks.",0

"There has recently been increasing interest in learning representations of temporal knowledge graphs (KGs), which record the dynamic relationships between entities over time. Temporal KGs often exhibit multiple simultaneous non-Euclidean structures, such as hierarchical and cyclic structures. However, existing embedding approaches for temporal KGs typically learn entity representations and their dynamic evolution in the Euclidean space, which might not capture such intrinsic structures very well. To this end, we propose Dy- ERNIE, a non-Euclidean embedding approach that learns evolving entity representations in a product of Riemannian manifolds, where the composed spaces are estimated from the sectional curvatures of underlying data. Product manifolds enable our approach to better reflect a wide variety of geometric structures on temporal KGs. Besides, to capture the evolutionary dynamics of temporal KGs, we let the entity representations evolve according to a velocity vector defined in the tangent space at each timestamp. We analyze in detail the contribution of geometric spaces to representation learning of temporal KGs and evaluate our model on temporal knowledge graph completion tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate significantly improved performance, indicating that the dynamics of multi-relational graph data can be more properly modeled by the evolution of embeddings on Riemannian manifolds.",0

"We present BlockGAN, an image generative model that learns object-aware 3D scene representations directly from unlabelled 2D images. Current work on scene representation learning either ignores scene background or treats the whole scene as one object. Meanwhile, work that considers scene compositionality treats scene objects only as image patches or 2D layers with alpha maps. Inspired by the computer graphics pipeline, we design BlockGAN to learn to first generate 3D features of background and foreground objects, then combine them into 3D features for the wholes cene, and finally render them into realistic images. This allows BlockGAN to reason over occlusion and interaction between objects' appearance, such as shadow and lighting, and provides control over each object's 3D pose and identity, while maintaining image realism. BlockGAN is trained end-to-end, using only unlabelled single images, without the need for 3D geometry, pose labels, object masks, or multiple views of the same scene. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features to represent objects allows BlockGAN to learn disentangled representations both in terms of objects (foreground and background) and their properties (pose and identity).",0

"Qualitative analysis of verbal data is of central importance in the learning sciences. It is labor-intensive and time-consuming, however, which limits the amount of data researchers can include in studies. This work is a step towards building a statistical machine learning (ML) method for achieving an automated support for qualitative analyses of students' writing, here specifically in score laboratory reports in introductory biology for sophistication of argumentation and reasoning. We start with a set of lab reports from an undergraduate biology course, scored by a four-level scheme that considers the complexity of argument structure, the scope of evidence, and the care and nuance of conclusions. Using this set of labeled data, we show that a popular natural language modeling processing pipeline, namely vector representation of words, a.k.a word embeddings, followed by Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for capturing language generation as a state-space model, is able to quantitatively capture the scoring, with a high Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) prediction score, when trained in via a novel contrastive learning set-up. We show that the ML algorithm approached the inter-rater reliability of human analysis. Ultimately, we conclude, that machine learning (ML) for natural language processing (NLP) holds promise for assisting learning sciences researchers in conducting qualitative studies at much larger scales than is currently possible.",0

"High dimensional data analysis for exploration and discovery includes three fundamental tasks: dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization. When the three associated tasks are done separately, as is often the case thus far, inconsistencies can occur among the tasks in terms of data geometry and others. This can lead to confusing or misleading data interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-based method, called Consistent Representation Learning (CRL), to accomplish the three associated tasks end-to-end and improve the consistencies. The CRL network consists of two nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) transformations: (1) one from the input data space to the latent feature space for clustering, and (2) the other from the clustering space to the final 2D or 3D space for visualization. Importantly, the two NLDR transformations are performed to best satisfy local geometry preserving (LGP) constraints across the spaces or network layers, to improve data consistencies along with the processing flow. Also, we propose a novel metric, clustering-visualization inconsistency (CVI), for evaluating the inconsistencies. Extensive comparative results show that the proposed CRL neural network method outperforms the popular t-SNE and UMAP-based and other contemporary clustering and visualization algorithms in terms of evaluation metrics and visualization.",0

"The performance of generative zero-shot methods mainly depends on the quality of generated features and how well the model facilitates knowledge transfer between visual and semantic domains. The quality of generated features is a direct consequence of the ability of the model to capture the several modes of the underlying data distribution. To address these issues, we propose a new two-level joint maximization idea to augment the generative network with an inference network during training which helps our model capture the several modes of the data and generate features that better represent the underlying data distribution. This provides strong cross-modal interaction for effective transfer of knowledge between visual and semantic domains. Furthermore, existing methods train the zero-shot classifier either on generate synthetic image features or latent embeddings produced by leveraging representation learning. In this work, we unify these paradigms into a single model which in addition to synthesizing image features, also utilizes the representation learning capabilities of the inference network to provide discriminative features for the final zero-shot recognition task. We evaluate our approach on four benchmark datasets i.e. CUB, FLO, AWA1 and AWA2 against several state-of-the-art methods, and show its performance.

"Estimating mutual information between continuous random variables is often intractable and extremely challenging for high-dimensional data. Recent progress has leveraged neural networks to optimize variational lower bounds on mutual information. Although showing promise for this difficult problem, the variational methods have been theoretically and empirically proven to have serious statistical limitations: 1) many methods struggle to produce accurate estimates when the underlying mutual information is either low or high; 2) the resulting estimators may suffer from high variance. Our approach is based on training a classifier that provides the probability that a data sample pair is drawn from the joint distribution rather than from the product of its marginal distributions. Moreover, we establish a direct connection between mutual information and the average log odds estimate produced by the classifier on a test set, leading to a simple and accurate estimator of mutual information. We show theoretically that our method and other variational approaches are equivalent when they achieve their optimum, while our method sidesteps the variational bound. Empirical results demonstrate high accuracy of our approach and the advantages of our estimator in the context of representation learning.

"Deep neural nets typically perform end-to-end backpropagation to learn the weights, a procedure that creates synchronization constraints in the weight update step across layers and is not biologically plausible. Recent advances in unsupervised contrastive representation learning point to the question of whether a learning algorithm can also be made local, that is, the updates of lower layers do not directly depend on the computation of upper layers. While Greedy InfoMax separately learns each block with a local objective, we found that it consistently hurts readout accuracy in state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive learning algorithms, possibly due to the greedy objective as well as gradient isolation. In this work, we discover that by overlapping local blocks stacking on top of each other, we effectively increase the decoder depth and allow upper blocks to implicitly send feedbacks to lower blocks. This simple design closes the performance gap between local learning and end-to-end contrastive learning algorithms for the first time. Aside from standard ImageNet experiments, we also show results on complex downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation directly using readout features.",0

"Fair representation learning provides an effective way of enforcing fairness constraints without compromising utility for downstream users. A desirable family of such fairness constraints, each requiring similar treatment for similar individuals, is known as individual fairness. In this work, we introduce the first method that enables data consumers to obtain certificates of individual fairness for existing and new data points. The key idea is to map similar individuals to close latent representations and leverage this latent proximity to certify individual fairness. That is, our method enables the data producer to learn and certify a representation where for a data point all similar individuals are at $\ell_\infty$-distance at most $\epsilon$, thus allowing data consumers to certify individual fairness by proving $\epsilon$-robustness of their classifier. Our experimental evaluation on five real-world datasets and several fairness constraints demonstrates the expressivity and scalability of our approach.",0

"Canine mammary carcinoma (CMC) has been used as a model to investigate the pathogenesis of human breast cancer and the same grading scheme is commonly used to assess tumor malignancy in both.

We present a novel dataset of 21 WSIs of CMC completely annotated for MF. For this, a pathologist screened all WSIs for potential MF and structures with a similar appearance. A second expert blindly assigned labels, and for non-matching labels, a third expert assigned the final labels. Additionally, we used machine learning to identify previously undetected MF. Finally, we performed representation learning and two-dimensional projection to further increase the consistency of the annotations. Our dataset consists of 13,907 MF and 36,379 hard negatives.

"Feature-based transfer is one of the most effective methodologies for transfer learning. Existing studies usually assume that the learned new feature representation is truly \emph{domain-invariant}, and thus directly train a transfer model $\mathcal{M}$ on source domain. In this paper, we consider a more realistic scenario where the new feature representation is suboptimal and small divergence still exists across domains. We propose a new learning strategy with a transfer model called Randomized Transferable Machine (RTM). More specifically, we work on source data with the new feature representation learned from existing feature-based transfer methods. The key idea is to enlarge source training data populations by randomly corrupting source data using some noises, and then train a transfer model $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$ that performs well on all the corrupted source data populations. In principle, the more corruptions are made, the higher the probability of the target data can be covered by the constructed source populations, and thus better transfer performance can be achieved by $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$. An ideal case is with infinite corruptions, which however is infeasible in reality. We develop a marginalized solution with linear regression model and dropout noise. With a marginalization trick, we can train an RTM that is equivalently to training using infinite source noisy populations without truly conducting any corruption. More importantly, such an RTM has a closed-form solution, which enables very fast and efficient training. Extensive experiments on various real-world transfer tasks show that RTM is a promising transfer model.",0

"Recent advances in unsupervised representation learning have experienced remarkable progress, especially with the achievements of contrastive learning, which regards each image as well its augmentations as a separate class, while does not consider the semantic similarity among images. This paper proposes a new kind of data augmentation, named Center-wise Local Image Mixture, to expand the neighborhood space of an image. CLIM encourages both local similarity and global aggregation while pulling similar images. This is achieved by searching local similar samples of an image, and only selecting images that are closer to the corresponding cluster center, which we denote as center-wise local selection. As a result, similar representations are progressively approaching the clusters, while do not break the local similarity. Furthermore, image mixture is used as a smoothing regularization to avoid overconfidence on the selected samples. Besides, we introduce multi-resolution augmentation, which enables the representation to be scale invariant. Integrating the two augmentations produces better feature representation on several unsupervised benchmarks. Notably, we reach 75.5% top-1 accuracy with linear evaluation over ResNet-50, and 59.3% top-1 accuracy when fine-tuned with only 1% labels, as well as consistently outperforming supervised pretraining on several downstream transfer tasks.",0

"Self-supervised learning achieves superior performance in many domains by extracting useful representations from the unlabeled data. However, most of traditional self-supervised methods mainly focus on exploring the inter-sample structure while less efforts have been concentrated on the underlying intra-temporal structure, which is important for time series data. In this paper, we present SelfTime: a general self-supervised time series representation learning framework, by exploring the inter-sample relation and intra-temporal relation of time series to learn the underlying structure feature on the unlabeled time series. Specifically, we first generate the inter-sample relation by sampling positive and negative samples of a given anchor sample, and intra-temporal relation by sampling time pieces from this anchor. Then, based on the sampled relation, a shared feature extraction backbone combined with two separate relation reasoning heads are employed to quantify the relationships of the sample pairs for inter-sample relation reasoning, and the relationships of the time piece pairs for intra-temporal relation reasoning, respectively. Finally, the useful representations of time series are extracted from the backbone under the supervision of relation reasoning heads. Experimental results on multiple real-world time series datasets for time series classification task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

"Recent unsupervised contrastive representation learning follows a Single Instance Multi-view (SIM) paradigm where positive pairs are usually constructed with intra-image data augmentation. In this paper, we propose an effective approach called Beyond Single Instance Multi-view (BSIM). Specifically, we impose more accurate instance discrimination capability by measuring the joint similarity between two randomly sampled instances and their mixture, namely spurious-positive pairs. We believe that learning joint similarity helps to improve the performance when encoded features are distributed more evenly in the latent space. We apply it as an orthogonal improvement for unsupervised contrastive representation learning, including current outstanding methods SimCLR, MoCo, and BYOL.

This paper introduces a more effective method called Beyond Single Instance Multi-view (BSIM), which enhances instance discrimination by measuring joint similarity between two randomly sampled instances and their mixture, or spurious-positive pairs. By improving joint similarity, we can achieve better performance when features are evenly distributed in the latent space. We apply this method as an orthogonal improvement to outstanding unsupervised contrastive representation learning methods, such as SimCLR, MoCo, and BYOL. We evaluate our approach on various downstream benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k and PASCAL VOC 2007 for linear classification, and MS COCO 2017 and VOC for object detection.

"Disentanglement learning is crucial for obtaining disentangled representations and controllable generation. Current disentanglement methods face several inherent limitations: difficulty with high-resolution images, primarily focusing on learning disentangled representations, and non-identifiability due to the unsupervised setting. To alleviate these limitations, we design new architectures and loss functions based on StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019), for semi-supervised high-resolution disentanglement learning. We create two complex high-resolution synthetic datasets for systematic testing. We investigate the impact of limited supervision and find that using only 0.25%~2.5% of labeled data is sufficient for good disentanglement on both synthetic and real datasets. We propose new metrics to quantify generator controllability, and observe there may exist a crucial trade-off between disentangled representation learning and controllable generation. We also consider semantic fine-grained image editing to achieve better generalization to unseen images.",0

"Leveraging temporal information has been regarded as essential for developing video understanding models. However, how to properly incorporate temporal information into the recent successful instance discrimination based contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) framework remains unclear. As an intuitive solution, we find that directly applying temporal augmentations does not help, or even impair video CSL in general. This counter-intuitive observation motivates us to re-design existing video CSL frameworks, for better integration of temporal knowledge.   To this end, we present Temporal-aware Contrastive self-supervised learningTaCo, as a general paradigm to enhance video CSL. Specifically, TaCo selects a set of temporal transformations not only as strong data augmentation but also to constitute extra self-supervision for video understanding. By jointly contrasting instances with enriched temporal transformations and learning these transformations as self-supervised signals, TaCo can significantly enhance unsupervised video representation learning. For instance, TaCo demonstrates consistent improvement in downstream classification tasks over a list of backbones and CSL approaches. Our best model achieves 85.1% (UCF-101) and 51.6% (HMDB-51) top-1 accuracy, which is a 3% and 2.4% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.",0

"Multi-view action recognition (MVAR) leverages complementary temporal information from different views to improve the learning performance. Obtaining informative view-specific representation plays an essential role in MVAR. Attention has been widely adopted as an effective strategy for discovering discriminative cues underlying temporal data. However, most existing MVAR methods only utilize attention to extract representation for each view individually, ignoring the potential to dig latent patterns based on mutual-support information in attention space. To this end, we propose a collaborative attention mechanism (CAM) for solving the MVAR problem in this paper. The proposed CAM detects the attention differences among multi-view, and adaptively integrates frame-level information to benefit each other. Specifically, we extend the long short-term memory (LSTM) to a Mutual-Aid RNN (MAR) to achieve the multi-view collaboration process. CAM takes advantages of view-specific attention pattern to guide another view and discover potential information which is hard to be explored by itself. It paves a novel way to leverage attention information and enhances the multi-view representation learning. Extensive experiments on four action datasets illustrate the proposed CAM achieves better results for each view and also boosts multi-view performance.",0

"Despite the success of deep learning in domains such as image, voice, and graphs, there has been little progress in deep representation learning for domains without a known structure between features. For instance, a tabular dataset of different demographic and clinical factors where the feature interactions are not given as a prior. In this paper, we propose Group-Connected Multilayer Perceptron (GMLP) networks to enable deep representation learning in these domains. GMLP is based on the idea of learning expressive feature combinations (groups) and exploiting them to reduce the network complexity by defining local group-wise operations. During the training phase, GMLP learns a sparse feature grouping matrix using temperature annealing softmax with an added entropy loss term to encourage the sparsity. Furthermore, an architecture is suggested which resembles binary trees, where group-wise operations are followed by pooling operations to combine information; reducing the number of groups as the network grows in depth. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on different real-world datasets covering various application areas. Additionally, we provide visualizations on MNIST and synthesized data. According to the results, GMLP is able to successfully learn and exploit expressive feature combinations and achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on different datasets.",0

"The three-dimensional shape and conformation of small-molecule ligands are critical for biomolecular recognition, yet encoding 3D geometry has not improved ligand-based virtual screening approaches. We describe an end-to-end deep learning approach that operates directly on small-molecule conformational ensembles and identifies key conformational poses of small-molecules. Our networks leverage two levels of representation learning: 1) individual conformers are first encoded as spatial graphs using a graph neural network, and 2) sampled conformational ensembles are represented as sets using an attention mechanism to aggregate over individual instances. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on a simple task based on bidentate coordination of biaryl ligands, and show how attention-based pooling can elucidate key conformational poses in tasks based on molecular geometry. This work illustrates how set-based learning approaches may be further developed for small molecule-based virtual screening.",0

"We introduce Constr-DRKM, a deep kernel method for the unsupervised learning of disentangled data representations. We propose augmenting the original deep restricted kernel machine formulation for kernel PCA by orthogonality constraints on the latent variables to promote disentanglement and to make it possible to carry out optimization without first defining a stabilized objective. After illustrating an end-to-end training procedure based on a quadratic penalty optimization algorithm with warm start, we quantitatively evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness in disentangled feature learning. We demonstrate on four benchmark datasets that this approach performs similarly overall to $\beta$-VAE on a number of disentanglement metrics when few training points are available, while being less sensitive to randomness and hyperparameter selection than $\beta$-VAE. We also present a deterministic initialization of Constr-DRKM's training algorithm that significantly improves the reproducibility of the results. Finally, we empirically evaluate and discuss the role of the number of layers in the proposed methodology, examining the influence of each principal component in every layer and showing that components in lower layers act as local feature detectors capturing the broad trends of the data distribution, while components in deeper layers use the representation learned by previous layers and more accurately reproduce higher-level features.",0

"We introduce Exemplar VAEs, a family of generative models that bridge the gap between parametric and non-parametric, exemplar based generative models. Exemplar VAE is a variant of VAE with a non-parametric prior in the latent space based on a Parzen window estimator. To sample from it, one first draws a random exemplar from a training set, then stochastically transforms that exemplar into a latent code and a new observation. We propose retrieval augmented training (RAT) as a way to speed up Exemplar VAE training by using approximate nearest neighbor search in the latent space to define a lower bound on log marginal likelihood. To enhance generalization, model parameters are learned using exemplar leave-one-out and subsampling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Exemplar VAEs on density estimation and representation learning. Importantly, generative data augmentation using Exemplar VAEs on permutation invariant MNIST and Fashion MNIST reduces classification error from 1.17% to 0.69% and from 8.56% to 8.16%.",0

"Retrieving unlabeled videos by textual queries, known as Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS), is a core theme in multimedia data management and retrieval. The success of AVS counts on cross-modal representation learning that encodes both query sentences and videos into common spaces for semantic similarity computation. Inspired by the initial success of previously few works in combining multiple sentence encoders, this paper takes a step forward by developing a new and general method for effectively exploiting diverse sentence encoders. The novelty of the proposed method, which we term Sentence Encoder Assembly (SEA), is two-fold. First, different from prior art that use only a single common space, SEA supports text-video matching in multiple encoder-specific common spaces. Such a property prevents the matching from being dominated by a specific encoder that produces an encoding vector much longer than other encoders. Second, in order to explore complementarities among the individual common spaces, we propose multi-space multi-loss learning. As extensive experiments on four benchmarks (MSR-VTT, TRECVID AVS 2016-2019, TGIF and MSVD) show, SEA surpasses the state-of-the-art. In addition, SEA is extremely ease to implement. All this makes SEA an appealing solution for AVS and promising for continuously advancing the task by harvesting new sentence encoders.",0

"Density-ratio estimation via classification is a cornerstone of unsupervised learning. It has provided the foundation for state-of-the-art methods in representation learning and generative modelling, with the number of use-cases continuing to proliferate. However, it suffers from a critical limitation: it fails to accurately estimate ratios p/q for which the two densities differ significantly. Empirically, we find this occurs whenever the KL divergence between p and q exceeds tens of nats. To resolve this limitation, we introduce a new framework, telescoping density-ratio estimation (TRE), that enables the estimation of ratios between highly dissimilar densities in high-dimensional spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that TRE can yield substantial improvements over existing single-ratio methods for mutual information estimation, representation learning and energy-based modelling.",0

"Self-supervised representation learning has witnessed significant leaps fueled by recent progress in Contrastive learning, which seeks to learn transformations that embed positive input pairs nearby, while pushing negative pairs far apart. While positive pairs can be generated reliably (e.g., as different views of the same image), it is difficult to accurately establish negative pairs, defined as samples from different images regardless of their semantic content or visual features. A fundamental problem in contrastive learning is mitigating the effects of false negatives. Contrasting false negatives induces two critical issues in representation learning: discarding semantic information and slow convergence. In this paper, we study this problem in detail and propose novel approaches to mitigate the effects of false negatives. The proposed methods exhibit consistent and significant improvements over existing contrastive learning-based models. They achieve new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet evaluations, achieving 5.8% absolute improvement in top-1 accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art when finetuning with 1% labels, as well as transferring to downstream tasks.",0

"Today's most popular approaches to keypoint detection involve very complex network architectures that aim to learn holistic representations of all keypoints. In this work, we take a step back and ask: Can we simply learn a local keypoint representation from the output of a standard backbone architecture? This will help make the network simpler and more robust, particularly if large parts of the object are occluded. We demonstrate that this is possible by looking at the problem from the perspective of representation learning. Specifically, the keypoint kernels need to be chosen to optimize three types of distances in the feature space: Features of the same keypoint should be similar to each other, while differing from those of other keypoints, and also being distinct from features from the background clutter. We formulate this optimization process within a framework, which we call CoKe, which includes supervised contrastive learning. CoKe needs to make several approximations to enable representation learning process on large datasets. In particular, we introduce a clutter bank to approximate non-keypoint features, and a momentum update to compute the keypoint representation while training the feature extractor. Our experiments show that CoKe achieves state-of-the-art results compared to approaches that jointly represent all keypoints holistically (Stacked Hourglass Networks, MSS-Net) as well as to approaches that are supervised by detailed 3D object geometry (StarMap). Moreover, CoKe is robust and performs exceptionally well when objects are partially occluded and significantly outperforms related work on a range of diverse datasets (PASCAL3D+, MPII, ObjectNet3D).",0

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been applied to sequential estimation and prediction problems identifying and developing hypothetical treatment strategies for septic patients, with a particular focus on offline learning with observational data. In practice, successful RL relies on informative latent states derived from sequential observations to develop optimal treatment strategies. To date, how best to construct such states in a healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them.

"A fundamental task in data exploration is to extract simplified low dimensional representations that capture intrinsic geometry in data, especially for faithfully visualizing data in two or three dimensions. Common approaches to this task use kernel methods for manifold learning. However, these methods typically only provide an embedding of fixed input data and cannot extend to new data points. Autoencoders have also recently become popular for representation learning. But while they naturally compute feature extractors that are both extendable to new data and invertible (i.e., reconstructing original features from latent representation), they have limited capabilities to follow global intrinsic geometry compared to kernel-based manifold learning. We present a new method for integrating both approaches by incorporating a geometric regularization term in the bottleneck of the autoencoder. Our regularization, based on the diffusion potential distances from the recently-proposed PHATE visualization method, encourages the learned latent representation to follow intrinsic data geometry, similar to manifold learning algorithms, while still enabling faithful extension to new data and reconstruction of data in the original feature space from latent coordinates. We compare our approach with leading kernel methods and autoencoder models for manifold learning to provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of our advantages in preserving intrinsic structure, out of sample extension, and reconstruction. Our method is easily implemented for big-data applications, whereas other methods are limited in this regard.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning has proved to be a critical component of anomaly detection/localization in images. The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we propose to use the ""distillation"" of features at various layers of an expert network, pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both issues. We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values given the input data. We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation leads to better exploiting the expert's knowledge and more distinctive discrepancy compared to solely utilizing the last layer activation values. Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need expensive region-based training. In contrast, with no need for any special or intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our novel framework for the localization of anomalous regions. Despite the striking contrast between some test datasets and ImageNet, we achieve competitive or significantly superior results compared to the SOTA methods on MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, MVTecAD, Retinal-OCT, and two Medical datasets on both anomaly detection and localization.",0
"The use of unsupervised representation learning has proven crucial in detecting and localizing anomalies in images. However, there are two main challenges in learning such a representation. Firstly, the sample size is often too small to learn a generalizable representation using conventional techniques. Secondly, the learned features must be able to discriminate between normal and anomalous samples, even though only normal samples are available during training. To address these challenges, we propose using a simpler cloner network to distill features from various layers of an expert network pre-trained on ImageNet. We then use the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values to detect and localize anomalies. By considering multiple intermediate hints during distillation, we can better exploit the expert's knowledge and achieve more distinctive discrepancies compared to using only the last layer activation values. Our framework incorporates interpretability algorithms to localize anomalous regions without the need for special or intensive training procedures. Despite differences between test datasets and ImageNet, our method achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods on various datasets for both anomaly detection and localization.",1
"Graph representation learning has attracted lots of attention recently. Existing graph neural networks fed with the complete graph data are not scalable due to limited computation and memory costs. Thus, it remains a great challenge to capture rich information in large-scale graph data. Besides, these methods mainly focus on supervised learning and highly depend on node label information, which is expensive to obtain in the real world. As to unsupervised network embedding approaches, they overemphasize node proximity instead, whose learned representations can hardly be used in downstream application tasks directly. In recent years, emerging self-supervised learning provides a potential solution to address the aforementioned problems. However, existing self-supervised works also operate on the complete graph data and are biased to fit either global or very local (1-hop neighborhood) graph structures in defining the mutual information based loss terms.   In this paper, a novel self-supervised representation learning method via Subgraph Contrast, namely \textsc{Subg-Con}, is proposed by utilizing the strong correlation between central nodes and their sampled subgraphs to capture regional structure information. Instead of learning on the complete input graph data, with a novel data augmentation strategy, \textsc{Subg-Con} learns node representations through a contrastive loss defined based on subgraphs sampled from the original graph instead. Compared with existing graph representation learning approaches, \textsc{Subg-Con} has prominent performance advantages in weaker supervision requirements, model learning scalability, and parallelization. Extensive experiments verify both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our work compared with both classic and state-of-the-art graph representation learning approaches on multiple real-world large-scale benchmark datasets from different domains.",0

"Arguably one of the top success stories of deep learning is transfer learning. The finding that pre-training a network on a rich source set (eg., ImageNet) can help boost performance once fine-tuned on a usually much smaller target set, has been instrumental to many applications in language and vision. Yet, very little is known about its usefulness in 3D point cloud understanding. We see this as an opportunity considering the effort required for annotating data in 3D. In this work, we aim at facilitating research on 3D representation learning. Different from previous works, we focus on high-level scene understanding tasks. To this end, we select a suite of diverse datasets and tasks to measure the effect of unsupervised pre-training on a large source set of 3D scenes. Our findings are extremely encouraging: using a unified triplet of architecture, source dataset, and contrastive loss for pre-training, we achieve improvement over recent best results in segmentation and detection across 6 different benchmarks for indoor and outdoor, real and synthetic datasets -- demonstrating that the learned representation can generalize across domains. Furthermore, the improvement was similar to supervised pre-training, suggesting that future efforts should favor scaling data collection over more detailed annotation. We hope these findings will encourage more research on unsupervised pretext task design for 3D deep learning.",0

"Siamese networks have become a common structure in various recent models for unsupervised visual representation learning. These models maximize the similarity between two augmentations of one image, subject to certain conditions for avoiding collapsing solutions. In this paper, we report surprising empirical results that simple Siamese networks can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) negative sample pairs, (ii) large batches, (iii) momentum encoders. Our experiments show that collapsing solutions do exist for the loss and structure, but a stop-gradient operation plays an essential role in preventing collapsing. We provide a hypothesis on the implication of stop-gradient, and further show proof-of-concept experiments verifying it. Our ""SimSiam"" method achieves competitive results on ImageNet and downstream tasks.

"We propose a model-agnostic pipeline to recover graph signals from an expert system by exploiting the content addressable memory property of restricted Boltzmann machine and the representational ability of a neural network. The proposed pipeline requires the deep neural network that is trained on a downward machine learning task with clean data, data which is free from any form of corruption or incompletion. We show that denoising the representations learned by the deep neural networks is usually more effective than denoising the data itself.

"Presence of bias (in datasets or tasks) is inarguably one of the most critical challenges in machine learning applications that has alluded to pivotal debates in recent years. Such challenges range from spurious associations between variables in medical studies to the bias of race in gender or face recognition systems. Controlling for all types of biases in the dataset curation stage is cumbersome and sometimes impossible. The alternative is to use the available data and build models incorporating fair representation learning. In this paper, we propose such a model based on adversarial training with two competing objectives to learn features that have (1) maximum discriminative power with respect to the task and (2) minimal statistical mean dependence with the protected (bias) variable(s). Our approach does so by incorporating a new adversarial loss function that encourages a vanished correlation between the bias and the learned features. We apply our method to synthetic data, medical images (containing task bias), and a dataset for gender classification (containing dataset bias). Our results show that the learned features by our method not only result in superior prediction performance but also are unbiased. The code is available at https://github.com/QingyuZhao/BR-Net/.",0
"Undoubtedly, bias in datasets or tasks is a crucial obstacle in the field of machine learning that has sparked significant discussions in recent years. The issues caused by bias can vary from misleading correlations between variables in medical research to the problem of race bias in gender or facial recognition systems.

"We present a new framework for self-supervised representation learning by formulating it as a ranking problem in an image retrieval context on a large number of random views (augmentations) obtained from images. Our work is based on two intuitions: first, a good representation of images must yield a high-quality image ranking in a retrieval task; second, we would expect random views of an image to be ranked closer to a reference view of that image than random views of other images. Hence, we model representation learning as a learning to rank problem for image retrieval. We train a representation encoder by maximizing average precision (AP) for ranking, where random views of an image are considered positively related, and that of the other images considered negatives. The new framework, dubbed S2R2, enables computing a global objective on multiple views, compared to the local objective in the popular contrastive learning framework, which is calculated on pairs of views. In principle, by using a ranking criterion, we eliminate reliance on object-centric curated datasets. When trained on STL10 and MS-COCO, S2R2 outperforms SimCLR and the clustering-based contrastive learning model, SwAV, while being much simpler both conceptually and at implementation. On MS-COCO, S2R2 outperforms both SwAV and SimCLR with a larger margin than on STl10. This indicates that S2R2 is more effective on diverse scenes and could eliminate the need for an object-centric large training dataset for self-supervised representation learning.",0

"Causal modeling has been recognized as a potential solution to many challenging problems in machine learning (ML). Here, we describe how a recently proposed counterfactual approach developed to deconfound linear structural causal models can still be used to deconfound the feature representations learned by deep neural network (DNN) models. The key insight is that by training an accurate DNN using softmax activation at the classification layer, and then adopting the representation learned by the last layer prior to the output layer as our features, we have that, by construction, the learned features will fit well a (multi-class) logistic regression model, and will be linearly associated with the labels. As a consequence, deconfounding approaches based on simple linear models can be used to deconfound the feature representations learned by DNNs. We validate the proposed methodology using colored versions of the MNIST dataset. Our results illustrate how the approach can effectively combat confounding and improve model stability in the context of dataset shifts generated by selection biases.",0
"Many complex problems in machine learning can be solved with causal modeling. This article explains how a counterfactual method, originally designed for linear structural causal models, can also be used to deconfound the feature representations learned by deep neural network models. By training a precise DNN using softmax activation, we can use the features learned by the last layer before the output layer to fit a logistic regression model, and these features will be associated with the labels in a linear manner. As a result, we can use linear models to deconfound the feature representations in DNNs. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using colored MNIST data, which shows how it can improve model stability in cases of dataset shifts caused by selection biases.",1
"Representation learning on graphs has emerged as a powerful mechanism to automate feature vector generation for downstream machine learning tasks. The advances in representation on graphs have centered on both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, where the latter presenting the challenges associated with multi-typed nodes and/or edges. In this paper, we consider the additional challenge of evolving graphs. We ask the question of whether the advances in representation learning for static graphs can be leveraged for dynamic graphs and how? It is important to be able to incorporate those advances to maximize the utility and generalization of methods. To that end, we propose the Framework for Incremental Learning of Dynamic Networks Embedding (FILDNE), which can utilize any existing static representation learning method for learning node embeddings, while keeping the computational costs low. FILDNE integrates the feature vectors computed using the standard methods over different timesteps into a single representation by developing a convex combination function and alignment mechanism. Experimental results on several downstream tasks, over seven real-world data sets, show that FILDNE is able to reduce memory and computational time costs while providing competitive quality measure gains with respect to the contemporary methods for representation learning on dynamic graphs.",0

"Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to improve a model's generalization capability in low data regimes. Recent FSL works have made steady progress via metric learning, meta learning, representation learning, etc. However, FSL remains challenging due to the following longstanding difficulties. 1) The seen and unseen classes are disjoint, resulting in a distribution shift between training and testing. 2) During testing, labeled data of previously unseen classes is sparse, making it difficult to reliably extrapolate from labeled support examples to unlabeled query examples. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce Hybrid Consistency Training to jointly leverage interpolation consistency, including interpolating hidden features, that imposes linear behavior locally and data augmentation consistency that learns robust embeddings against sample variations. As for the second challenge, we use unlabeled examples to iteratively normalize features and adapt prototypes, as opposed to commonly used one-time update, for more reliable prototype-based transductive inference. We show that our method generates a 2% to 5% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods with similar backbones on five FSL datasets and, more notably, a 7% to 8% improvement for more challenging cross-domain FSL.",0

"We present a new generative autoencoder model with dual contradistinctive losses to improve generative autoencoder that performs simultaneous inference (reconstruction) and synthesis (sampling).

Extensive experimental results by DC-VAE across different resolutions including 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, and 512x512 are reported.

"We present a novel nonparametric algorithm for symmetry-based disentangling of data manifolds, the Geometric Manifold Component Estimator (GEOMANCER). GEOMANCER provides a partial answer to the question posed by Higgins et al. (2018): is it possible to learn how to factorize a Lie group solely from observations of the orbit of an object it acts on? We show that fully unsupervised factorization of a data manifold is possible if the true metric of the manifold is known and each factor manifold has nontrivial holonomy -- for example, rotation in 3D. Our algorithm works by estimating the subspaces that are invariant under random walk diffusion, giving an approximation to the de Rham decomposition from differential geometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of GEOMANCER on several complex synthetic manifolds. Our work reduces the question of whether unsupervised disentangling is possible to the question of whether unsupervised metric learning is possible, providing a unifying insight into the geometric nature of representation learning.",0

"Despite extensive standardization, diagnostic interviews for mental health disorders encompass substantial subjective judgment. Previous studies have demonstrated that EEG-based neural measures can function as reliable objective correlates of depression, or even predictors of depression and its course. However, their clinical utility has not been fully realized because of 1) the lack of automated ways to deal with the inherent noise associated with EEG data at scale, and 2) the lack of knowledge of which aspects of the EEG signal may be markers of a clinical disorder. Here we adapt an unsupervised pipeline from the recent deep representation learning literature to address these problems by 1) learning a disentangled representation using $\beta$-VAE to denoise the signal, and 2) extracting interpretable features associated with a sparse set of clinical labels using a Symbol-Concept Association Network (SCAN). We demonstrate that our method is able to outperform the canonical hand-engineered baseline classification method on a number of factors, including participant age and depression diagnosis. Furthermore, our method recovers a representation that can be used to automatically extract denoised Event Related Potentials (ERPs) from novel, single EEG trajectories, and supports fast supervised re-mapping to various clinical labels, allowing clinicians to re-use a single EEG representation regardless of updates to the standardized diagnostic system. Finally, single factors of the learned disentangled representations often correspond to meaningful markers of clinical factors, as automatically detected by SCAN, allowing for human interpretability and post-hoc expert analysis of the recommendations made by the model.",0

"In this paper we show that learning video feature spaces in which temporal cycles are maximally predictable benefits action classification. In particular, we propose a novel learning approach termed Cycle Encoding Prediction (CEP) that is able to effectively represent high-level spatio-temporal structure of unlabelled video content. CEP builds a latent space wherein the concept of closed forward-backward as well as backward-forward temporal loops is approximately preserved. As a self-supervision signal, CEP leverages the bi-directional temporal coherence of the video stream and applies loss functions that encourage both temporal cycle closure as well as contrastive feature separation. Architecturally, the underpinning network structure utilises a single feature encoder for all video snippets, adding two predictive modules that learn temporal forward and backward transitions. We apply our framework for pretext training of networks for action recognition tasks. We report significantly improved results for the standard datasets UCF101 and HMDB51.

"Recently, contrastive learning has largely advanced the progress of unsupervised visual representation learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet, some self-supervised algorithms reported higher transfer learning performance compared to fully-supervised methods, seeming to deliver the message that human labels hardly contribute to learning transferrable visual features. In this paper, we defend the usefulness of semantic labels but point out that fully-supervised and self-supervised methods are pursuing different kinds of features. To alleviate this issue, we present a new algorithm named Supervised Contrastive Adjustment in Neighborhood (SCAN) that maximally prevents the semantic guidance from damaging the appearance feature embedding. In a series of downstream tasks, SCAN achieves superior performance compared to previous fully-supervised and self-supervised methods, and sometimes the gain is significant.

"This paper presents TCE: Temporally Coherent Embeddings for self-supervised video representation learning. The proposed method exploits inherent structure of unlabeled video data to explicitly enforce temporal coherency in the embedding space, rather than indirectly learning it through ranking or predictive proxy tasks. In the same way that high-level visual information in the world changes smoothly, we believe that nearby frames in learned representations will benefit from demonstrating similar properties. Using this assumption, we train our TCE model to encode videos such that adjacent frames exist close to each other and videos are separated from one another. Using TCE we learn robust representations from large quantities of unlabeled video data. We thoroughly analyse and evaluate our self-supervised learned TCE models on a downstream task of video action recognition using multiple challenging benchmarks (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51). With a simple but effective 2D-CNN backbone and only RGB stream inputs, TCE pre-trained representations outperform all previous selfsupervised 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN pre-trained on UCF101.

"Patient representation learning refers to learning a dense mathematical representation of a patient that encodes meaningful information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This is generally performed using advanced deep learning methods. This study presents a systematic review of this field and provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses from a methodological perspective. We identified studies developing patient representations from EHRs with deep learning methods from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library. After screening 363 articles, 49 papers were included for a comprehensive data collection. We noticed a typical workflow starting with feeding raw data, applying deep learning models, and ending with clinical outcome predictions as evaluations of the learned representations. Specifically, learning representations from structured EHR data was dominant (37 out of 49 studies). Recurrent Neural Networks were widely applied as the deep learning architecture (LSTM: 13 studies, GRU: 11 studies). Disease prediction was the most common application and evaluation (31 studies). Benchmark datasets were mostly unavailable (28 studies) due to privacy concerns of EHR data, and code availability was assured in 20 studies. We show the importance and feasibility of learning comprehensive representations of patient EHR data through a systematic review. Advances in patient representation learning techniques will be essential for powering patient-level EHR analyses.

However, most of existing CNN-based facial landmark detection methods have not attempted to activate multiple correlated facial parts and learn different semantic features from them that they can not accurately model the relationships among the local details and can not fully explore more discriminative and fine semantic features, thus they suffer from partial occlusions and large pose variations. To address these problems, we propose a cross-order cross-semantic deep network (CCDN) to boost the semantic features learning for robust facial landmark detection. Specifically, a cross-order two-squeeze multi-excitation (CTM) module is proposed to introduce the cross-order channel correlations for more discriminative representations learning and multiple attention-specific part activation. Moreover, a novel cross-order cross-semantic (COCS) regularizer is designed to drive the network to learn cross-order cross-semantic features from different activation for facial landmark detection. It is interesting to show that by integrating the CTM module and COCS regularizer, the proposed CCDN can effectively activate and learn more fine and complementary cross-order cross-semantic features to improve the accuracy of facial landmark detection under extremely challenging scenarios. Experimental results on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CCDN over state-of-the-art facial landmark detection methods.",0

"With the rapid emergence of graph representation learning, the construction of new large-scale datasets are necessary to distinguish model capabilities and accurately assess the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. By carefully analyzing existing graph databases, we identify 3 critical components important for advancing the field of graph representation learning: (1) large graphs, (2) many graphs, and (3) class diversity. To date, no single graph database offers all of these desired properties. We introduce MalNet, the largest public graph database ever constructed, representing a large-scale ontology of software function call graphs.

"In this paper, we focus on unsupervised representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. Existing approaches usually learn action representations by sequential prediction but they suffer from the inability to fully learn semantic information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework named Prototypical Contrast and Reverse Prediction (PCRP), which not only creates reverse sequential prediction to learn low-level information (e.g., body posture at every frame) and high-level pattern (e.g., motion order), but also devises action prototypes to implicitly encode semantic similarity shared among sequences. In general, we regard action prototypes as latent variables and formulate PCRP as an expectation-maximization task. Specifically, PCRP iteratively runs (1) E-step as determining the distribution of prototypes by clustering action encoding from the encoder, and (2) M-step as optimizing the encoder by minimizing the proposed ProtoMAE loss, which helps simultaneously pull the action encoding closer to its assigned prototype and perform reverse prediction task. Extensive experiments on N-UCLA, NTU 60, and NTU 120 dataset present that PCRP outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and even achieves superior performance over some of supervised methods.

"In this paper, we introduce ActBERT for self-supervised learning of joint video-text representations from unlabeled data. First, we leverage global action information to catalyze the mutual interactions between linguistic texts and local regional objects. It uncovers global and local visual clues from paired video sequences and text descriptions for detailed visual and text relation modeling. Second, we introduce an ENtangled Transformer block (ENT) to encode three sources of information, i.e., global actions, local regional objects, and linguistic descriptions. Global-local correspondences are discovered via judicious clues extraction from contextual information. It enforces the joint videotext representation to be aware of fine-grained objects as well as global human intention. We validate the generalization capability of ActBERT on downstream video-and language tasks, i.e., text-video clip retrieval, video captioning, video question answering, action segmentation, and action step localization.

"Intelligently reasoning about the world often requires integrating data from multiple modalities, as any individual modality may contain unreliable or incomplete information. Prior work in multimodal learning fuses input modalities only after significant independent processing. On the other hand, the brain performs multimodal processing almost immediately. This divide between conventional multimodal learning and neuroscience suggests that a detailed study of early multimodal fusion could improve artificial multimodal representations. To facilitate the study of early multimodal fusion, we create a convolutional LSTM network architecture that simultaneously processes both audio and visual inputs, and allows us to select the layer at which audio and visual information combines. Our results demonstrate that immediate fusion of audio and visual inputs in the initial C-LSTM layer results in higher performing networks that are more robust to the addition of white noise in both audio and visual inputs.",0

"Graph representation learning is to learn universal node representations that preserve both node attributes and structural information. The derived node representations can be used to serve various downstream tasks, such as node classification and node clustering. When a graph is heterogeneous, the problem becomes more challenging than the homogeneous graph node learning problem. Inspired by the emerging information theoretic-based learning algorithm, in this paper we propose an unsupervised graph neural network Heterogeneous Deep Graph Infomax (HDGI) for heterogeneous graph representation learning. We use the meta-path structure to analyze the connections involving semantics in heterogeneous graphs and utilize graph convolution module and semantic-level attention mechanism to capture local representations. By maximizing local-global mutual information, HDGI effectively learns high-level node representations that can be utilized in downstream graph-related tasks.

"As a hot research topic, many multi-view clustering approaches are proposed over the past few years. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms merely take the consensus information among different views into consideration for clustering. Actually, it may hinder the multi-view clustering performance in real-life applications, since different views usually contain diverse statistic properties. To address this problem, we propose a novel Tensor-based Intrinsic Subspace Representation Learning (TISRL) for multi-view clustering in this paper. Concretely, the rank preserving decomposition is proposed firstly to effectively deal with the diverse statistic information contained in different views. Then, to achieve the intrinsic subspace representation, the tensor-singular value decomposition based low-rank tensor constraint is also utilized in our method. It can be seen that specific information contained in different views is fully investigated by the rank preserving decomposition, and the high-order correlations of multi-view data are also mined by the low-rank tensor constraint. The objective function can be optimized by an augmented Lagrangian multiplier based alternating direction minimization algorithm. Experimental results on nine common used real-world multi-view datasets illustrate the superiority of TISRL.",0

We propose EGAD, a neural network architecture to capture the graph evolution by introducing a self-attention mechanism on the weights between consecutive graph convolutional networks. In addition, we account for the fact that neural architectures require a huge amount of parameters to train, thus increasing the online inference latency and negatively influencing the user experience in a live video streaming event. To address the problem of the high online inference of a vast number of parameters, we propose a knowledge distillation strategy.

"Contrastive representation learning has been outstandingly successful in practice. In this work, we identify two key properties related to the contrastive loss: (1) alignment (closeness) of features from positive pairs, and (2) uniformity of the induced distribution of the (normalized) features on the hypersphere. We prove that, asymptotically, the contrastive loss optimizes these properties, and analyze their positive effects on downstream tasks. Empirically, we introduce an optimizable metric to quantify each property. Extensive experiments on standard vision and language datasets confirm the strong agreement between both metrics and downstream task performance. Remarkably, directly optimizing for these two metrics leads to representations with comparable or better performance at downstream tasks than contrastive learning.

However, dealing with unsupervised learning of intricate data is challenging, and even the most effective techniques demonstrate weaker performance compared to their supervised counterparts. In computer vision, self-supervised deep learning has become a valuable tool for representation learning. Nevertheless, these approaches have not yet been assessed in a fully unsupervised environment. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method for unsupervised classification that relies on self-supervised representations. We tested our approach using various recent self-supervised techniques and discovered that it delivers competitive outcomes for ImageNet classification, achieving a 39% accuracy with 1000 clusters and 46% with overclustering. We propose that unsupervised evaluation be included in the standard benchmarks for self-supervised learning. Our code is accessible at https://github.com/Randl/kmeans_selfsuper.",1
"Human drivers produce a vast amount of data which could, in principle, be used to improve autonomous driving systems. Unfortunately, seemingly straightforward approaches for creating end-to-end driving models that map sensor data directly into driving actions are problematic in terms of interpretability, and typically have significant difficulty dealing with spurious correlations. Alternatively, we propose to use this kind of action-based driving data for learning representations. Our experiments show that an affordance-based driving model pre-trained with this approach can leverage a relatively small amount of weakly annotated imagery and outperform pure end-to-end driving models, while being more interpretable. Further, we demonstrate how this strategy outperforms previous methods based on learning inverse dynamics models as well as other methods based on heavy human supervision (ImageNet).",0

"Graph neural network (GNN) has recently been established as an effective representation learning framework on graph data. However, the popular message passing models rely on local permutation invariant aggregate functions, which gives rise to the concerns about their representational power. Here, we introduce the concept of automorphic equivalence to theoretically analyze GNN's expressiveness in differentiating node's structural role. We show that the existing message passing GNNs have limitations in learning expressive representations. Moreover, we design a novel GNN class that leverages learnable automorphic equivalence filters to explicitly differentiate the structural roles of each node's neighbors, and uses a squeeze-and-excitation module to fuse various structural information. We theoretically prove that the proposed model is expressive in terms of generating distinct representations for nodes with different structural feature. Besides, we empirically validate our model on eight real-world graph data, including social network, e-commerce co-purchase network and citation network, and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines.",0

"Graph representation learning is a fundamental task in various applications that strives to learn low-dimensional embeddings for nodes that can preserve graph topology information. However, many existing methods focus on static graphs while ignoring evolving graph patterns. Inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks(GCNs) in static graph embedding, we propose a novel k-core based temporal graph convolutional network, the CTGCN, to learn node representations for dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous dynamic graph embedding methods, CTGCN can preserve both local connective proximity and global structural similarity while simultaneously capturing graph dynamics. In the proposed framework, the traditional graph convolution is generalized into two phases, feature transformation and feature aggregation, which gives the CTGCN more flexibility and enables the CTGCN to learn connective and structural information under the same framework. Experimental results on 7 real-world graphs demonstrate that the CTGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph embedding methods in several tasks, including link prediction and structural role classification.

"Graph representation learning is of paramount importance for a variety of graph analytical tasks, ranging from node classification to community detection. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been successfully applied for graph representation learning.

"Data-driven graph learning models a network by determining the strength of connections between its nodes. The data refers to a graph signal which associates a value with each graph node. Existing graph learning methods either use simplified models for the graph signal, or they are prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and memory requirements. This is particularly true when the number of nodes is high or there are temporal changes in the network. In order to consider richer models with a reasonable computational tractability, we introduce a graph learning method based on representation learning on graphs. Representation learning generates an embedding for each graph node, taking the information from neighbouring nodes into account. Our graph learning method further modifies the embeddings to compute the graph similarity matrix. In this work, graph learning is used to examine brain networks for brain state identification. We infer time-varying brain graphs from an extensive dataset of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals from ten patients. We then apply the graphs as input to a classifier to distinguish seizure vs. non-seizure brain states. Using the binary classification metric of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), this approach yields an average of 9.13 percent improvement when compared to two widely used brain network modeling methods.",0

"Invertible neural networks based on coupling flows (CF-INNs) have various machine learning applications such as image synthesis and representation learning. However, their desirable characteristics such as analytic invertibility come at the cost of restricting the functional forms. This poses a question on their representation power: are CF-INNs universal approximators for invertible functions? Without a universality, there could be a well-behaved invertible transformation that the CF-INN can never approximate, hence it would render the model class unreliable. We answer this question by showing a convenient criterion: a CF-INN is universal if its layers contain affine coupling and invertible linear functions as special cases. As its corollary, we can affirmatively resolve a previously unsolved problem: whether normalizing flow models based on affine coupling can be universal distributional approximators. In the course of proving the universality, we prove a general theorem to show the equivalence of the universality for certain diffeomorphism classes, a theoretical insight that is of interest by itself.",0

"Finding well-defined clusters in data represents a fundamental challenge for many data-driven applications, and largely depends on good data representation. Drawing on literature regarding representation learning, studies suggest that one key characteristic of good latent representations is the ability to produce semantically mixed outputs when decoding linear interpolations of two latent representations. We propose the Mixing Consistent Deep Clustering method which encourages interpolations to appear realistic while adding the constraint that interpolations of two data points must look like one of the two inputs. By applying this training method to various clustering (non-)specific autoencoder models we found that using the proposed training method systematically changed the structure of learned representations of a model and it improved clustering performance for the tested ACAI, IDEC, and VAE models on the MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets. These outcomes have practical implications for numerous real-world clustering tasks, as it shows that the proposed method can be added to existing autoencoders to further improve clustering performance.",0

Specifically, we consider the problem of learning a large-margin classifier for data possessing a hierarchical structure. Our first contribution is a hyperbolic perceptron algorithm, which provably converges to a separating hyperplane. We then provide an algorithm to efficiently learn a large-margin hyperplane, relying on the careful injection of adversarial examples.

"We introduce a novel self-supervised pretext task for learning representations from audio-visual content. Prior work on audio-visual representation learning leverages correspondences at the video level. Approaches based on audio-visual correspondence (AVC) predict whether audio and video clips originate from the same or different video instances. Audio-visual temporal synchronization (AVTS) further discriminates negative pairs originated from the same video instance but at different moments in time. While these approaches learn high-quality representations for downstream tasks such as action recognition, their training objectives disregard spatial cues naturally occurring in audio and visual signals. To learn from these spatial cues, we tasked a network to perform contrastive audio-visual spatial alignment of 360{\deg} video and spatial audio. The ability to perform spatial alignment is enhanced by reasoning over the full spatial content of the 360{\deg} video using a transformer architecture to combine representations from multiple viewpoints. The advantages of the proposed pretext task are demonstrated on a variety of audio and visual downstream tasks, including audio-visual correspondence, spatial alignment, action recognition, and video semantic segmentation.",0

"Due to the widespread applications in real-world scenarios, metro ridership prediction is a crucial but challenging task in intelligent transportation systems. However, conventional methods either ignore the topological information of metro systems or directly learn on physical topology, and cannot fully explore the patterns of ridership evolution. To address this problem, we model a metro system as graphs with various topologies and propose a unified Physical-Virtual Collaboration Graph Network (PVCGN), which can effectively learn the complex ridership patterns from the tailor-designed graphs. Specifically, a physical graph is directly built based on the realistic topology of the studied metro system, while a similarity graph and a correlation graph are built with virtual topologies under the guidance of the inter-station passenger flow similarity and correlation. These complementary graphs are incorporated into a Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (GC-GRU) for spatial-temporal representation learning. Further, a Fully-Connected Gated Recurrent Unit (FC-GRU) is also applied to capture the global evolution tendency. Finally, we develop a Seq2Seq model with GC-GRU and FC-GRU to forecast the future metro ridership sequentially.

"Recent works found that fine-tuning and joint training---two popular approaches for transfer learning---do not always improve accuracy on downstream tasks. First, we aim to understand more about when and why fine-tuning and joint training can be suboptimal or even harmful for transfer learning. We design semi-synthetic datasets where the source task can be solved by either source-specific features or transferable features. We observe that (1) pre-training may not have incentive to learn transferable features and (2) joint training may simultaneously learn source-specific features and overfit to the target. Second, to improve over fine-tuning and joint training, we propose Meta Representation Learning (MeRLin) to learn transferable features. MeRLin meta-learns representations by ensuring that a head fit on top of the representations with target training data also performs well on target validation data. We also prove that MeRLin recovers the target ground-truth model with a quadratic neural net parameterization and a source distribution that contains both transferable and source-specific features. On the same distribution, pre-training and joint training provably fail to learn transferable features. MeRLin empirically outperforms previous state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms on various real-world vision and NLP transfer learning benchmarks.",0

"Representation learning from 3D point clouds is challenging due to their inherent nature of permutation invariance and irregular distribution in space. Existing deep learning methods follow a hierarchical feature extraction paradigm in which high-level abstract features are derived from low-level features. However, they fail to exploit different granularity of information due to the limited interaction between these features. To this end, we propose Multi-Abstraction Refinement Network (MARNet) that ensures an effective exchange of information between multi-level features to gain local and global contextual cues while effectively preserving them till the final layer. We empirically show the effectiveness of MARNet in terms of state-of-the-art results on two challenging tasks: Shape classification and Coarse-to-fine grained semantic segmentation.

By applying this framework to small and high-dimensional control problems, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance.",1
"Many real-world video-text tasks involve different levels of granularity, such as frames and words, clip and sentences or videos and paragraphs, each with distinct semantics. In this paper, we propose a Cooperative hierarchical Transformer (COOT) to leverage this hierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of granularity and different modalities. The method consists of three major components: an attention-aware feature aggregation layer, which leverages the local temporal context (intra-level, e.g., within a clip), a contextual transformer to learn the interactions between low-level and high-level semantics (inter-level, e.g. clip-video, sentence-paragraph), and a cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to connect video and text. The resulting method compares favorably to the state of the art on several benchmarks while having few parameters. All code is available open-source at https://github.com/gingsi/coot-videotext",0

"We present a Reverse Reinforcement Learning (Reverse RL) approach for representing retrospective knowledge. General Value Functions (GVFs) have enjoyed great success in representing predictive knowledge, i.e., answering questions about possible future outcomes such as ""how much fuel will be consumed in expectation if we drive from A to B?"". GVFs, however, cannot answer questions like ""how much fuel do we expect a car to have given it is at B at time $t$?"". To answer this question, we need to know when that car had a full tank and how that car came to B. Since such questions emphasize the influence of possible past events on the present, we refer to their answers as retrospective knowledge. In this paper, we show how to represent retrospective knowledge with Reverse GVFs, which are trained via Reverse RL. We demonstrate empirically the utility of Reverse GVFs in both representation learning and anomaly detection.",0
"Our paper introduces a new method called Reverse Reinforcement Learning (Reverse RL) to capture retrospective knowledge. While General Value Functions (GVFs) have been successful in representing predictive knowledge about future outcomes, they cannot address questions related to past events.

This type of knowledge is known as retrospective knowledge, as it depends on past events. To address this, we propose Reverse GVFs, which can be trained via Reverse RL to capture retrospective knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Reverse GVFs in representation learning and anomaly detection.",1
"This paper reviews the novel concept of controllable variational autoencoder (ControlVAE), discusses its parameter tuning to meet application needs, derives its key analytic properties, and offers useful extensions and applications. ControlVAE is a new variational autoencoder (VAE) framework that combines the automatic control theory with the basic VAE to stabilize the KL-divergence of VAE models to a specified value. It leverages a non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to dynamically tune the weight of the KL-divergence term in the evidence lower bound (ELBO) using the output KL-divergence as feedback. This allows us to precisely control the KL-divergence to a desired value (set point), which is effective in avoiding posterior collapse and learning disentangled representations. In order to improve the ELBO over the regular VAE, we provide simplified theoretical analysis to inform setting the set point of KL-divergence for ControlVAE. We observe that compared to other methods that seek to balance the two terms in VAE's objective, ControlVAE leads to better learning dynamics. In particular, it can achieve a good trade-off between reconstruction quality and KL-divergence. We evaluate the proposed method on three tasks: image generation, language modeling and disentangled representation learning. The results show that ControlVAE can achieve much better reconstruction quality than the other methods for comparable disentanglement. On the language modeling task, ControlVAE can avoid posterior collapse (KL vanishing) and improve the diversity of generated text. Moreover, our method can change the optimization trajectory, improving the ELBO and the reconstruction quality for image generation.",0

"Recently proposed neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms adopt neural predictors to accelerate the architecture search. The capability of neural predictors to accurately predict the performance metrics of neural architecture is critical to NAS, and the acquisition of training datasets for neural predictors is time-consuming. How to obtain a neural predictor with high prediction accuracy using a small amount of training data is a central problem to neural predictor-based NAS. Here, we firstly design a new architecture encoding scheme that overcomes the drawbacks of existing vector-based architecture encoding schemes to calculate the graph edit distance of neural architectures. To enhance the predictive performance of neural predictors, we devise two self-supervised learning methods from different perspectives to pre-train the architecture embedding part of neural predictors to generate a meaningful representation of neural architectures. The first one is to train a carefully designed two branch graph neural network model to predict the graph edit distance of two input neural architectures. The second method is inspired by the prevalently contrastive learning, and we present a new contrastive learning algorithm that utilizes a central feature vector as a proxy to contrast positive pairs against negative pairs. Experimental results illustrate that the pre-trained neural predictors can achieve comparable or superior performance compared with their supervised counterparts with several times less training samples. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the NASBench-101 and NASBench201 benchmarks when integrating the pre-trained neural predictors with an evolutionary NAS algorithm.",0

"Self-supervised, multi-modal learning has been successful in holistic representation of complex scenarios. This can be useful to consolidate information from multiple modalities which have multiple, versatile uses. Its application in surgical robotics can lead to simultaneously developing a generalised machine understanding of the surgical process and reduce the dependency on quality, expert annotations which are generally difficult to obtain. We develop a self-supervised, multi-modal representation learning paradigm that learns representations for surgical gestures from video and kinematics. We use an encoder-decoder network configuration that encodes representations from surgical videos and decodes them to yield kinematics. We quantitatively demonstrate the efficacy of our learnt representations for gesture recognition (with accuracy between 69.6 % and 77.8 %), transfer learning across multiple tasks (with accuracy between 44.6 % and 64.8 %) and surgeon skill classification (with accuracy between 76.8 % and 81.2 %).

"Studies recently accomplished on the Enteric Nervous System have shown that chronic degenerative diseases affect the Enteric Glial Cells (EGC) and, thus, the development of recognition methods able to identify whether or not the EGC are affected by these type of diseases may be helpful in its diagnoses. In this work, we propose the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to evaluate if a given animal EGC image was obtained from a healthy individual or one affect by a chronic degenerative disease. In the proposed approach, we have performed the classification task with handcrafted features and deep learning based techniques, also known as non-handcrafted features. The handcrafted features were obtained from the textural content of the ECG images using texture descriptors, such as the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Moreover, the representation learning techniques employed in the approach are based on different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, such as AlexNet and VGG16, with and without transfer learning. The complementarity between the handcrafted and non-handcrafted features was also evaluated with late fusion techniques. The datasets of EGC images used in the experiments, which are also contributions of this paper, are composed of three different chronic degenerative diseases: Cancer, Diabetes Mellitus, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. The experimental results, supported by statistical analysis, shown that the proposed approach can distinguish healthy cells from the sick ones with a recognition rate of 89.30% (Rheumatoid Arthritis), 98.45% (Cancer), and 95.13% (Diabetes Mellitus), being achieved by combining classifiers obtained both feature scenarios.",0

"For mental disorders, patients' underlying mental states are non-observed latent constructs which have to be inferred from observed multi-domain measurements such as diagnostic symptoms and patient functioning scores. Additionally, substantial heterogeneity in the disease diagnosis between patients needs to be addressed for optimizing individualized treatment policy in order to achieve precision medicine. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated learning framework that can simultaneously learn patients' underlying mental states and recommend optimal treatments for each individual. This learning framework is based on the measurement theory in psychiatry for modeling multiple disease diagnostic measures as arising from the underlying causes (true mental states). It allows incorporation of the multivariate pre- and post-treatment outcomes as well as biological measures while preserving the invariant structure for representing patients' latent mental states. A multi-layer neural network is used to allow complex treatment effect heterogeneity. Optimal treatment policy can be inferred for future patients by comparing their potential mental states under different treatments given the observed multi-domain pre-treatment measurements. Experiments on simulated data and a real-world clinical trial data show that the learned treatment polices compare favorably to alternative methods on heterogeneous treatment effects, and have broad utilities which lead to better patient outcomes on multiple domains.",0

"We propose a tree-based algorithm for classification and regression problems in the context of functional data analysis, which allows to leverage representation learning and multiple splitting rules at the node level, reducing generalization error while retaining the interpretability of a tree. This is achieved by learning a weighted functional $L^{2}$ space by means of constrained convex optimization, which is then used to extract multiple weighted integral features from the input functions, in order to determine the binary split for each internal node of the tree. The approach is designed to manage multiple functional inputs and/or outputs, by defining suitable splitting rules and loss functions that can depend on the specific problem and can also be combined with scalar and categorical data, as the tree is grown with the original greedy CART algorithm.

"Machine learning with missing data has been approached in two different ways, including feature imputation where missing feature values are estimated based on observed values, and label prediction where downstream labels are learned directly from incomplete data. However, existing imputation models tend to have strong prior assumptions and cannot learn from downstream tasks, while models targeting label prediction often involve heuristics and can encounter scalability issues. Here we propose GRAPE, a graph-based framework for feature imputation as well as label prediction. GRAPE tackles the missing data problem using a graph representation, where the observations and features are viewed as two types of nodes in a bipartite graph, and the observed feature values as edges. Under the GRAPE framework, the feature imputation is formulated as an edge-level prediction task and the label prediction as a node-level prediction task. These tasks are then solved with Graph Neural Networks. Experimental results on nine benchmark datasets show that GRAPE yields 20% lower mean absolute error for imputation tasks and 10% lower for label prediction tasks, compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.",0

We first investigate the issues surrounding the assumptions about uniformity made by InfoGAN, and demonstrate its ineffectiveness to properly disentangle object identity in imbalanced data. Our key idea is to make the discovery of the discrete latent factor of variation invariant to identity-preserving transformations in real images, and use that as a signal to learn the appropriate latent distribution representing object identity. Experiments on both artificial (MNIST, 3D cars, 3D chairs, ShapeNet) and real-world (YouTube-Faces) imbalanced datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in disentangling object identity as a latent factor of variation.",0

"Heterogeneous graph representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional vector representations of different types of entities and relations to empower downstream tasks. Existing methods either capture semantic relationships but indirectly leverage node/edge attributes in a complex way, or leverage node/edge attributes directly without taking semantic relationships into account. When involving multiple convolution operations, they also have poor scalability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a flexible and efficient Graph information propagation Network (GripNet) framework. Specifically, we introduce a new supergraph data structure consisting of supervertices and superedges. A supervertex is a semantically-coherent subgraph. A superedge defines an information propagation path between two supervertices. GripNet learns new representations for the supervertex of interest by propagating information along the defined path using multiple layers.

"Frequency spectrum has played a significant role in learning unique and discriminating features for object recognition. Both low and high frequency information present in images have been extracted and learnt by a host of representation learning techniques, including deep learning. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel class of adversarial attacks, namely `WaveTransform', that creates adversarial noise corresponding to low-frequency and high-frequency subbands, separately (or in combination). The frequency subbands are analyzed using wavelet decomposition; the subbands are corrupted and then used to construct an adversarial example. Experiments are performed using multiple databases and CNN models to establish the effectiveness of the proposed WaveTransform attack and analyze the importance of a particular frequency component. The robustness of the proposed attack is also evaluated through its transferability and resiliency against a recent adversarial defense algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed attack is effective against the defense algorithm and is also transferable across CNNs.",0

"Learning representations of sets of nodes in a graph is crucial for applications ranging from node-role discovery to link prediction and molecule classification. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning. However, expressive power of GNNs is limited by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and thus GNNs generate identical representations for graph substructures that may in fact be very different. More powerful GNNs, proposed recently by mimicking higher-order-WL tests, only focus on representing entire graphs and they are computationally inefficient as they cannot utilize sparsity of the underlying graph. Here we propose and mathematically analyze a general class of structure-related features, termed Distance Encoding (DE). DE assists GNNs in representing any set of nodes, while providing strictly more expressive power than the 1-WL test. DE captures the distance between the node set whose representation is to be learned and each node in the graph. To capture the distance DE can apply various graph-distance measures such as shortest path distance or generalized PageRank scores. We propose two ways for GNNs to use DEs (1) as extra node features, and (2) as controllers of message aggregation in GNNs. Both approaches can utilize the sparse structure of the underlying graph, which leads to computational efficiency and scalability. We also prove that DE can distinguish node sets embedded in almost all regular graphs where traditional GNNs always fail. We evaluate DE on three tasks over six real networks: structural role prediction, link prediction, and triangle prediction. Results show that our models outperform GNNs without DE by up-to 15\% in accuracy and AUROC. Furthermore, our models also significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods especially designed for the above tasks.",0

"Most deep learning based image inpainting approaches adopt autoencoder or its variants to fill missing regions in images. Encoders are usually utilized to learn powerful representational spaces, which are important for dealing with sophisticated learning tasks. Specifically, in image inpainting tasks, masks with any shapes can appear anywhere in images (i.e., free-form masks) which form complex patterns. It is difficult for encoders to capture such powerful representations under this complex situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised Siamese inference network to improve the robustness and generalization. It can encode contextual semantics from full resolution images and obtain more discriminative representations. we further propose a multi-scale decoder with a novel dual attention fusion module (DAF), which can combine both the restored and known regions in a smooth way. This multi-scale architecture is beneficial for decoding discriminative representations learned by encoders into images layer by layer. In this way, unknown regions will be filled naturally from outside to inside.

"We prove a Chernoff-type bound for sums of matrix-valued random variables sampled via a regular (aperiodic and irreducible) finite Markov chain. Specially, consider a random walk on a regular Markov chain and a Hermitian matrix-valued function on its state space. Our result gives exponentially decreasing bounds on the tail distributions of the extreme eigenvalues of the sample mean matrix. Our proof is based on the matrix expander (regular undirected graph) Chernoff bound [Garg et al. STOC '18] and scalar Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds for Markov chains [Chung et al. STACS '12].   Our matrix Chernoff bound for Markov chains can be applied to analyze the behavior of co-occurrence statistics for sequential data, which have been common and important data signals in machine learning. We show that given a regular Markov chain with $n$ states and mixing time $\tau$, we need a trajectory of length $O(\tau (\log{(n)}+\log{(\tau)})/\epsilon^2)$ to achieve an estimator of the co-occurrence matrix with error bound $\epsilon$. We conduct several experiments and the experimental results are consistent with the exponentially fast convergence rate from theoretical analysis.

"Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant progress in face synthesis, there lacks enough understanding of what GANs have learned in the latent representation to map a random code to a photo-realistic image. In this work, we propose a framework called InterFaceGAN to interpret the disentangled face representation learned by the state-of-the-art GAN models and study the properties of the facial semantics encoded in the latent space. We first find that GANs learn various semantics in some linear subspaces of the latent space. After identifying these subspaces, we can realistically manipulate the corresponding facial attributes without retraining the model. We then conduct a detailed study on the correlation between different semantics and manage to better disentangle them via subspace projection, resulting in more precise control of the attribute manipulation. Besides manipulating the gender, age, expression, and presence of eyeglasses, we can even alter the face pose and fix the artifacts accidentally made by GANs. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth face identity analysis and a layer-wise analysis to evaluate the editing results quantitatively. Finally, we apply our approach to real face editing by employing GAN inversion approaches and explicitly training feed-forward models based on the synthetic data established by InterFaceGAN. Extensive experimental results suggest that learning to synthesize faces spontaneously brings a disentangled and controllable face representation.",0

It is different from recent approaches that merely learn correspondences across frames or clips. In our method, the frame and video representations are learned from a single network based on an R3D architecture, with a shared non-linear transformation for embedding both frame and video features before the cycle-contrastive loss. We demonstrate that the video representation learned by CCL can be transferred well to downstream tasks of video understanding, outperforming previous methods in nearest neighbour retrieval and action recognition tasks on UCF101, HMDB51 and MMAct.",0
"Introducing Cycle-Contrastive Learning (CCL), a fresh technique for acquiring video representation through self-supervision. CCL acknowledges the relationship between videos and their frames, and endeavors to identify correspondences across both domains by leveraging their contrastive representation. Unlike other recent methods that only learn correspondences within frames or clips, CCL employs a single network based on an R3D architecture to learn frame and video representations. The representations are then embedded using a shared nonlinear transformation before the application of cycle-contrastive loss. Our results demonstrate that the video representation obtained through CCL can be effectively applied to video understanding tasks, surpassing previous methods in nearest neighbor retrieval and action recognition on UCF101, HMDB51, and MMAct.",1
"Contrastive Learning has recently received interest due to its success in self-supervised representation learning in the computer vision domain. However, the origins of Contrastive Learning date as far back as the 1990s and its development has spanned across many fields and domains including Metric Learning and natural language processing. In this paper we provide a comprehensive literature review and we propose a general Contrastive Representation Learning framework that simplifies and unifies many different contrastive learning methods. We also provide a taxonomy for each of the components of contrastive learning in order to summarise it and distinguish it from other forms of machine learning. We then discuss the inductive biases which are present in any contrastive learning system and we analyse our framework under different views from various sub-fields of Machine Learning. Examples of how contrastive learning has been applied in computer vision, natural language processing, audio processing, and others, as well as in Reinforcement Learning are also presented. Finally, we discuss the challenges and some of the most promising future research directions ahead.",0

"The increasing impact of black box models, and particularly of unsupervised ones, comes with an increasing interest in tools to understand and interpret them. In this paper, we consider in particular how to characterise visual groupings discovered automatically by deep neural networks, starting with state-of-the-art clustering methods. In some cases, clusters readily correspond to an existing labelled dataset. However, often they do not, yet they still maintain an ""intuitive interpretability"". We introduce two concepts, visual learnability and describability, that can be used to quantify the interpretability of arbitrary image groupings, including unsupervised ones. The idea is to measure (1) how well humans can learn to reproduce a grouping by measuring their ability to generalise from a small set of visual examples (learnability) and (2) whether the set of visual examples can be replaced by a succinct, textual description (describability). By assessing human annotators as classifiers, we remove the subjective quality of existing evaluation metrics. For better scalability, we finally propose a class-level captioning system to generate descriptions for visual groupings automatically and compare it to human annotators using the describability metric.",0

"We consider the identifiability theory of probabilistic models and establish sufficient conditions under which the representations learned by a very broad family of conditional energy-based models are unique in function space, up to a simple transformation. In our model family, the energy function is the dot-product between two feature extractors, one for the dependent variable, and one for the conditioning variable. We show that under mild conditions, the features are unique up to scaling and permutation. Our results extend recent developments in nonlinear ICA, and in fact, they lead to an important generalization of ICA models. In particular, we show that our model can be used for the estimation of the components in the framework of Independently Modulated Component Analysis (IMCA), a new generalization of nonlinear ICA that relaxes the independence assumption. A thorough empirical study shows that representations learned by our model from real-world image datasets are identifiable, and improve performance in transfer learning and semi-supervised learning tasks.",0

"Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), involving a diversity of node types and relation types, are pervasive in many real-world applications. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to heterogeneous graph representation learning (HGRL) which aims to embed rich structural and semantics information in HIN into low-dimensional node representations. To date, most HGRL models rely on manual customisation of meta paths to capture the semantics underlying the given HIN. However, the dependency on the handcrafted meta-paths requires rich domain knowledge which is extremely difficult to obtain for complex and semantic rich HINs. Moreover, strictly defined meta-paths will limit the HGRL's access to more comprehensive information in HINs. To fully unleash the power of HGRL, we present a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RL-HGNN), to design different meta-paths for the nodes in a HIN. Specifically, RL-HGNN models the meta-path design process as a Markov Decision Process and uses a policy network to adaptively design a meta-path for each node to learn its effective representations. The policy network is trained with deep reinforcement learning by exploiting the performance of the model on a downstream task. We further propose an extension, RL-HGNN++, to ameliorate the meta-path design procedure and accelerate the training process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-HGNN, and reveals that it can identify meaningful meta-paths that would have been ignored by human knowledge.",0

"Graph Neural Networks achieve remarkable results on problems with structured data but come as black-box predictors. Transferring existing explanation techniques, such as occlusion, fails as even removing a single node or edge can lead to drastic changes in the graph. The resulting graphs can differ from all training examples, causing model confusion and wrong explanations. Thus, we argue that explicability must use graphs compliant with the distribution underlying the training data. We coin this property Distribution Compliant Explanation (DCE) and present a novel Contrastive GNN Explanation (CoGE) technique following this paradigm. An experimental study supports the efficacy of CoGE.",0

As a result, we advocate for the use of graphs that conform to the distribution underlying the training data for the sake of explicability.

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can use high-capacity deep networks to learn directly from image observations. However, these high-dimensional observation spaces present a number of challenges in practice, since the policy must now solve two problems: representation learning and task learning. In this work, we tackle these two problems separately, by explicitly learning latent representations that can accelerate reinforcement learning from images. We propose the stochastic latent actor-critic (SLAC) algorithm: a sample-efficient and high-performing RL algorithm for learning policies for complex continuous control tasks directly from high-dimensional image inputs. SLAC provides a novel and principled approach for unifying stochastic sequential models and RL into a single method, by learning a compact latent representation and then performing RL in the model's learned latent space. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms both model-free and model-based alternatives in terms of final performance and sample efficiency, on a range of difficult image-based control tasks.

"Model compression becomes a recent trend due to the requirement of deploying neural networks on embedded and mobile devices. Hence, both accuracy and efficiency are of critical importance. To explore a balance between them, a knowledge distillation strategy is proposed for general visual representation learning. It utilizes our well-designed activation map adaptive module to replace some blocks of the teacher network, exploring the most appropriate supervisory features adaptively during the training process. Using the teacher's hidden layer output to prompt the student network to train so as to transfer effective semantic information.To verify the effectiveness of our strategy, this paper applied our method to cifar-10 dataset.

"Self-supervised learning approaches leverage unlabeled samples to acquire generic knowledge about different concepts, hence allowing for annotation-efficient downstream task learning. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method that leverages multiple imaging modalities. We introduce the multimodal puzzle task, which facilitates rich representation learning from multiple image modalities. The learned representations allow for subsequent fine-tuning on different downstream tasks. To achieve that, we learn a modality-agnostic feature embedding by confusing image modalities at the data-level. Together with the Sinkhorn operator, with which we formulate the puzzle solving optimization as permutation matrix inference instead of classification, they allow for efficient solving of multimodal puzzles with varying levels of complexity. In addition, we also propose to utilize cross-modal generation techniques for multimodal data augmentation used for training self-supervised tasks. In other words, we exploit synthetic images for self-supervised pretraining, instead of downstream tasks directly, in order to circumvent quality issues associated with synthetic images, while improving data-efficiency and representations quality. Our experimental results, which assess the gains in downstream performance and data-efficiency, show that solving our multimodal puzzles yields better semantic representations, compared to treating each modality independently. Our results also highlight the benefits of exploiting synthetic images for self-supervised pretraining. We showcase our approach on four downstream tasks: Brain tumor segmentation and survival days prediction using four MRI modalities, Prostate segmentation using two MRI modalities, and Liver segmentation using unregistered CT and MRI modalities.

"Current autoencoder-based disentangled representation learning methods achieve disentanglement by penalizing the (aggregate) posterior to encourage statistical independence of the latent factors. This approach introduces a trade-off between disentangled representation learning and reconstruction quality since the model does not have enough capacity to learn correlated latent variables that capture detail information present in most image data. To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel multi-stage modelling approach where the disentangled factors are first learned using a preexisting disentangled representation learning method (such as $\beta$-TCVAE); then, the low-quality reconstruction is improved with another deep generative model that is trained to model the missing correlated latent variables, adding detail information while maintaining conditioning on the previously learned disentangled factors. Taken together, our multi-stage modelling approach results in a single, coherent probabilistic model that is theoretically justified by the principal of D-separation and can be realized with a variety of model classes including likelihood-based models such as variational autoencoders, implicit models such as generative adversarial networks, and tractable models like normalizing flows or mixtures of Gaussians.

"Crowdsourced data used in machine learning services might carry sensitive information about attributes that users do not want to share. Various methods have been proposed to minimize the potential information leakage of sensitive attributes while maximizing the task accuracy. However, little is known about the theory behind these methods. In light of this gap, we develop a novel theoretical framework for attribute obfuscation. Under our framework, we propose a minimax optimization formulation to protect the given attribute and analyze its inference guarantees against worst-case adversaries. Meanwhile, it is clear that in general there is a tension between minimizing information leakage and maximizing task accuracy. To understand this, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound to precisely characterize the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and information leakage. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets to corroborate the inference guarantees and validate this trade-off. Our results indicate that, among several alternatives, the adversarial learning approach achieves the best trade-off in terms of attribute obfuscation and accuracy maximization.",0

"Existing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods either encode neural architectures using discrete encodings that do not scale well, or adopt supervised learning-based methods to jointly learn architecture representations and optimize architecture search on such representations which incurs search bias. Despite the widespread use, architecture representations learned in NAS are still poorly understood. We observe that the structural properties of neural architectures are hard to preserve in the latent space if architecture representation learning and search are coupled, resulting in less effective search performance. In this work, we find empirically that pre-training architecture representations using only neural architectures without their accuracies as labels considerably improve the downstream architecture search efficiency. To explain these observations, we visualize how unsupervised architecture representation learning better encourages neural architectures with similar connections and operators to cluster together. This helps to map neural architectures with similar performance to the same regions in the latent space and makes the transition of architectures in the latent space relatively smooth, which considerably benefits diverse downstream search strategies.",0

"Representation learning of graph-structured data is challenging because both graph structure and node features carry important information. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide an expressive way to fuse information from network structure and node features. However, GNNs are prone to adversarial attacks. Here we introduce Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB), an information-theoretic principle that optimally balances expressiveness and robustness of the learned representation of graph-structured data. Inheriting from the general Information Bottleneck (IB), GIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between the representation and the target, and simultaneously constraining the mutual information between the representation and the input data. Different from the general IB, GIB regularizes the structural as well as the feature information. We design two sampling algorithms for structural regularization and instantiate the GIB principle with two new models: GIB-Cat and GIB-Bern, and demonstrate the benefits by evaluating the resilience to adversarial attacks. We show that our proposed models are more robust than state-of-the-art graph defense models. GIB-based models empirically achieve up to 31% improvement with adversarial perturbation of the graph structure as well as node features.",0

"Many important problems can be formulated as reasoning in knowledge graphs. Representation learning has proved extremely effective for transductive reasoning, in which one needs to make new predictions for already observed entities. This is true for both attributed graphs(where each entity has an initial feature vector) and non-attributed graphs (where the only initial information derives from known relations with other entities). For out-of-sample reasoning, where one needs to make predictions for entities that were unseen at training time, much prior work considers attributed graph. However, this problem is surprisingly under-explored for non-attributed graphs. In this paper, we study the out-of-sample representation learning problem for non-attributed knowledge graphs, create benchmark datasets for this task, develop several models and baselines, and provide empirical analyses and comparisons of the proposed models and baselines.",0

"Anomaly Detection (AD) in images is a fundamental computer vision problem and refers to identifying images and image substructures that deviate significantly from the norm. Popular AD algorithms commonly try to learn a model of normality from scratch using task specific datasets, but are limited to semi-supervised approaches employing mostly normal data due to the inaccessibility of anomalies on a large scale combined with the ambiguous nature of anomaly appearance.   We follow an alternative approach and demonstrate that deep feature representations learned by discriminative models on large natural image datasets are well suited to describe normality and detect even subtle anomalies in a transfer learning setting. Our model of normality is established by fitting a multivariate Gaussian (MVG) to deep feature representations of classification networks trained on ImageNet using normal data only. By subsequently applying the Mahalanobis distance as the anomaly score we outperform the current state of the art on the public MVTec AD dataset, achieving an AUROC value of $95.8 \pm 1.2$ (mean $\pm$ SEM) over all 15 classes. We further investigate why the learned representations are discriminative to the AD task using Principal Component Analysis. We find that the principal components containing little variance in normal data are the ones crucial for discriminating between normal and anomalous instances. This gives a possible explanation to the often sub-par performance of AD approaches trained from scratch using normal data only. By selectively fitting a MVG to these most relevant components only, we are able to further reduce model complexity while retaining AD performance. We also investigate setting the working point by selecting acceptable False Positive Rate thresholds based on the MVG assumption.   Code available at https://github.com/ORippler/gaussian-ad-mvtec",0

"Zero-shot classification is a generalization task where no instance from the target classes is seen during training. To allow for test-time transfer, each class is annotated with semantic information, commonly in the form of attributes or text descriptions. While classical zero-shot learning does not explicitly forbid using information from other datasets, the approaches that achieve the best absolute performance on image benchmarks rely on features extracted from encoders pretrained on Imagenet. This approach relies on hyper-optimized Imagenet-relevant parameters from the supervised classification setting, entangling important questions about the suitability of those parameters and how they were learned with more fundamental questions about representation learning and generalization. To remove these distractors, we propose a more challenging setting: Zero-Shot Learning from scratch (ZFS), which explicitly forbids the use of encoders fine-tuned on other datasets. Our analysis on this setting highlights the importance of local information, and compositional representations.",0

"We provide new statistical guarantees for transfer learning via representation learning--when transfer is achieved by learning a feature representation shared across different tasks. This enables learning on new tasks using far less data than is required to learn them in isolation. Formally, we consider $t+1$ tasks parameterized by functions of the form $f_j \circ h$ in a general function class $\mathcal{F} \circ \mathcal{H}$, where each $f_j$ is a task-specific function in $\mathcal{F}$ and $h$ is the shared representation in $\mathcal{H}$. Letting $C(\cdot)$ denote the complexity measure of the function class, we show that for diverse training tasks (1) the sample complexity needed to learn the shared representation across the first $t$ training tasks scales as $C(\mathcal{H}) + t C(\mathcal{F})$, despite no explicit access to a signal from the feature representation and (2) with an accurate estimate of the representation, the sample complexity needed to learn a new task scales only with $C(\mathcal{F})$.

In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical generative network, called DeepSVG, for complex SVG icons generation and interpolation. Our architecture effectively disentangles high-level shapes from the low-level commands that encode the shape itself. The network directly predicts a set of shapes in a non-autoregressive fashion. We introduce the task of complex SVG icons generation by releasing a new large-scale dataset along with an open-source library for SVG manipulation. We demonstrate that our network learns to accurately reconstruct diverse vector graphics, and can serve as a powerful animation tool by performing interpolations and other latent space operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexandre01/deepsvg.",0

"High-throughput molecular profiling technologies have produced high-dimensional multi-omics data, enabling systematic understanding of living systems at the genome scale. Studying molecular interactions across different data types helps reveal signal transduction mechanisms across different classes of molecules. In this paper, we develop a novel Bayesian representation learning method that infers the relational interactions across multi-omics data types. Our method, Bayesian Relational Learning (BayReL) for multi-omics data integration, takes advantage of a priori known relationships among the same class of molecules, modeled as a graph at each corresponding view, to learn view-specific latent variables as well as a multi-partite graph that encodes the interactions across views. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate enhanced performance of BayReL in inferring meaningful interactions compared to existing baselines.",0

"Unsupervised and self-supervised learning approaches have become a crucial tool to learn representations for downstream prediction tasks. While these approaches are widely used in practice and achieve impressive empirical gains, their theoretical understanding largely lags behind. Towards bridging this gap, we present a unifying perspective where several such approaches can be viewed as imposing a regularization on the representation via a learnable function using unlabeled data. We propose a discriminative theoretical framework for analyzing the sample complexity of these approaches, which generalizes the framework of (Balcan and Blum, 2010) to allow learnable regularization functions. Our sample complexity bounds show that, with carefully chosen hypothesis classes to exploit the structure in the data, these learnable regularization functions can prune the hypothesis space, and help reduce the amount of labeled data needed. We then provide two concrete examples of functional regularization, one using auto-encoders and the other using masked self-supervision, and apply our framework to quantify the reduction in the sample complexity bound of labeled data. We also provide complementary empirical results to support our analysis.",0

"Spatiotemporal representations learned using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) are currently used in state-of-the-art approaches for action related tasks. However, 3D-CNN are notorious for being memory and compute resource intensive as compared with more simple 2D-CNN architectures. We propose to hallucinate spatiotemporal representations from a 3D-CNN teacher with a 2D-CNN student. By requiring the 2D-CNN to predict the future and intuit upcoming activity, it is encouraged to gain a deeper understanding of actions and how they evolve. The hallucination task is treated as an auxiliary task, which can be used with any other action related task in a multitask learning setting. Thorough experimental evaluation shows that the hallucination task indeed helps improve performance on action recognition, action quality assessment, and dynamic scene recognition tasks. From a practical standpoint, being able to hallucinate spatiotemporal representations without an actual 3D-CNN can enable deployment in resource-constrained scenarios, such as with limited computing power and/or lower bandwidth.

"A prominent technique for self-supervised representation learning has been to contrast semantically similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. Without access to labels, dissimilar (negative) points are typically taken to be randomly sampled datapoints, implicitly accepting that these points may, in reality, actually have the same label. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we observe that sampling negative examples from truly different labels improves performance, in a synthetic setting where labels are available. Motivated by this observation, we develop a debiased contrastive objective that corrects for the sampling of same-label datapoints, even without knowledge of the true labels. Empirically, the proposed objective consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art for representation learning in vision, language, and reinforcement learning benchmarks. Theoretically, we establish generalization bounds for the downstream classification task.",0

"Learning interpretable and interpolatable latent representations has been an emerging research direction, allowing researchers to understand and utilize the derived latent space for further applications such as visual synthesis or recognition. While most existing approaches derive an interpolatable latent space and induces smooth transition in image appearance, it is still not clear how to observe desirable representations which would contain semantic information of interest. In this paper, we aim to learn meaningful representations and simultaneously perform semantic-oriented and visually-smooth interpolation. To this end, we propose an angular triplet-neighbor loss (ATNL) that enables learning a latent representation whose distribution matches the semantic information of interest. With the latent space guided by ATNL, we further utilize spherical semantic interpolation for generating semantic warping of images, allowing synthesis of desirable visual data. Experiments on MNIST and CMU Multi-PIE datasets qualitatively and quantitatively verify the effectiveness of our method.",0

"Value estimation is a critical component of the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The question of how to effectively learn value predictors from data is one of the major problems studied by the RL community, and different approaches exploit structure in the problem domain in different ways. Model learning can make use of the rich transition structure present in sequences of observations, but this approach is usually not sensitive to the reward function. In contrast, model-free methods directly leverage the quantity of interest from the future, but receive a potentially weak scalar signal (an estimate of the return). We develop an approach for representation learning in RL that sits in between these two extremes: we propose to learn what to model in a way that can directly help value prediction. To this end, we determine which features of the future trajectory provide useful information to predict the associated return. This provides tractable prediction targets that are directly relevant for a task, and can thus accelerate learning the value function. The idea can be understood as reasoning, in hindsight, about which aspects of the future observations could help past value prediction. We show how this can help dramatically even in simple policy evaluation settings. We then test our approach at scale in challenging domains, including on 57 Atari 2600 games.",0

"Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous samples from highly complex and unstructured data, which is pervasive in both fundamental research and industrial applications. However, most existing methods neglect the complex correlation among data samples, which is important for capturing normal patterns from which the abnormal ones deviate. In this paper, we propose a method of Correlation aware unsupervised Anomaly detection via Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (CADGMM), which captures the complex correlation among data points for high-quality low-dimensional representation learning. Specifically, the relations among data samples are correlated firstly in forms of a graph structure, in which, the node denotes the sample and the edge denotes the correlation between two samples from the feature space. Then, a dual-encoder that consists of a graph encoder and a feature encoder, is employed to encode both the feature and correlation information of samples into the low-dimensional latent space jointly, followed by a decoder for data reconstruction. Finally, a separate estimation network as a Gaussian Mixture Model is utilized to estimate the density of the learned latent vector, and the anomalies can be detected by measuring the energy of the samples. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0

"To leverage enormous unlabeled data on distributed edge devices, we formulate a new problem in federated learning called Federated Unsupervised Representation Learning (FURL) to learn a common representation model without supervision while preserving data privacy. FURL poses two new challenges: (1) data distribution shift (Non-IID distribution) among clients would make local models focus on different categories, leading to the inconsistency of representation spaces. (2) without the unified information among clients in FURL, the representations across clients would be misaligned. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Constrastive Averaging with dictionary and alignment (FedCA) algorithm. FedCA is composed of two key modules: (1) dictionary module to aggregate the representations of samples from each client and share with all clients for consistency of representation space and (2) alignment module to align the representation of each client on a base model trained on a public data. We adopt the contrastive loss for local model training. Through extensive experiments with three evaluation protocols in IID and Non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedCA outperforms all baselines with significant margins.",0

"Learning causal effects from observational data greatly benefits a variety of domains such as health care, education and sociology. For instance, one could estimate the impact of a new drug on specific individuals to assist the clinic plan and improve the survival rate. In this paper, we focus on studying the problem of estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) from observational data. The challenges for this problem are two-fold: on the one hand, we have to derive a causal estimator to estimate the causal quantity from observational data, where there exists confounding bias; on the other hand, we have to deal with the identification of CATE when the distribution of covariates in treatment and control groups are imbalanced. To overcome these challenges, we propose a neural network framework called Adversarial Balancing-based representation learning for Causal Effect Inference (ABCEI), based on the recent advances in representation learning. To ensure the identification of CATE, ABCEI uses adversarial learning to balance the distributions of covariates in treatment and control groups in the latent representation space, without any assumption on the form of the treatment selection/assignment function. In addition, during the representation learning and balancing process, highly predictive information from the original covariate space might be lost. ABCEI can tackle this information loss problem by preserving useful information for predicting causal effects under the regularization of a mutual information estimator. The experimental results show that ABCEI is robust against treatment selection bias, and matches/outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Our experiments show promising results on several datasets, representing different health care domains among others.",0

"Causal inference, or counterfactual prediction, is central to decision making in healthcare, policy and social sciences. To de-bias causal estimators with high-dimensional data in observational studies, recent advances suggest the importance of combining machine learning models for both the propensity score and the outcome function. We propose a novel scalable method to learn double-robust representations for counterfactual predictions, leading to consistent causal estimation if the model for either the propensity score or the outcome, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Specifically, we use the entropy balancing method to learn the weights that minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the representation between the treated and control groups, based on which we make robust and efficient counterfactual predictions for both individual and average treatment effects. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed method. The algorithm shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art on real world and synthetic data.",0

Here we empirically evaluate $\Gamma$-nets in the policy evaluation setting. We first demonstrate the approach on a square wave and then on a robot arm using linear function approximation. Next, we consider the deep reinforcement learning setting using several Atari video games. Our results show that $\Gamma$-nets can be effective for predicting arbitrary timescales, with only a small cost in accuracy as compared to learning estimators for fixed timescales. $\Gamma$-nets provide a method for compactly making predictions at many timescales without requiring a priori knowledge of the task, making it a valuable contribution to ongoing work on model-based planning, representation learning, and lifelong learning algorithms.",0

"We prove a new upper bound on the generalization gap of classifiers that are obtained by first using self-supervision to learn a representation $r$ of the training data, and then fitting a simple (e.g., linear) classifier $g$ to the labels. Specifically, we show that (under the assumptions described below) the generalization gap of such classifiers tends to zero if $\mathsf{C}(g) \ll n$, where $\mathsf{C}(g)$ is an appropriately-defined measure of the simple classifier $g$'s complexity, and $n$ is the number of training samples. We stress that our bound is independent of the complexity of the representation $r$. We do not make any structural or conditional-independence assumptions on the representation-learning task, which can use the same training dataset that is later used for classification. Rather, we assume that the training procedure satisfies certain natural noise-robustness (adding small amount of label noise causes small degradation in performance) and rationality (getting the wrong label is not better than getting no label at all) conditions that widely hold across many standard architectures. We show that our bound is non-vacuous for many popular representation-learning based classifiers on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, including SimCLR, AMDIM and MoCo.",0

Notably, our limit is independent of the complexity of the learned representation. We do not rely on any structural or conditional-independence assumptions in the representation learning process, which can utilize the same dataset for classification later. Instead, we assume natural noise-robustness and rationality conditions in the training procedure, which are widely applicable to standard architectures and ensure small performance degradation with label noise and the absence of labels.

"Knowledge graph (KG) representation learning methods have achieved competitive performance in many KG-oriented tasks, among which the best ones are usually based on graph neural networks (GNNs), a powerful family of networks that learns the representation of an entity by aggregating the features of its neighbors and itself. However, many KG representation learning scenarios only provide the structure information that describes the relationships among entities, causing that entities have no input features. In this case, existing aggregation mechanisms are incapable of inducing embeddings of unseen entities as these entities have no pre-defined features for aggregation. In this paper, we present a decentralized KG representation learning approach, decentRL, which encodes each entity from and only from the embeddings of its neighbors. For optimization, we design an algorithm to distill knowledge from the model itself such that the output embeddings can continuously gain knowledge from the corresponding original embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach performed better than many cutting-edge models on the entity alignment task, and achieved competitive performance on the entity prediction task. Furthermore, under the inductive setting, it significantly outperformed all baselines on both tasks.",0

"Self-supervised learning has emerged as a strategy to reduce the reliance on costly supervised signal by pretraining representations only using unlabeled data. These methods combine heuristic proxy classification tasks with data augmentations and have achieved significant success, but our theoretical understanding of this success remains limited.

We show how data augmentations can be more effectively utilized through explicit invariance constraints on the proxy classifiers employed during pretraining. Based on this, we propose a novel self-supervised objective, Representation Learning via Invariant Causal Mechanisms (ReLIC), that enforces invariant prediction of proxy targets across augmentations through an invariance regularizer which yields improved generalization guarantees. Further, using causality we generalize contrastive learning, a particular kind of self-supervised method, and provide an alternative theoretical explanation for the success of these methods.

This leads to the introduction of a novel self-supervised objective, Representation Learning via Invariant Causal Mechanisms (ReLIC), which enforces invariant prediction of proxy targets across augmentations through an invariance regularizer, resulting in improved generalization guarantees. Additionally, the study generalizes contrastive learning, a specific self-supervised method, using causality and provides an alternative theoretical explanation for the success of these methods. Empirically, ReLIC surpasses other methods in terms of robustness and out-of-distribution generalization on ImageNet, and even achieves above human-level performance on 51 out of 57 games on Atari.",1
"Graph convolution network (GCN) attracts intensive research interest with broad applications. While existing work mainly focused on designing novel GCN architectures for better performance, few of them studied a practical yet challenging problem: How to learn GCNs from data with extremely limited annotation? In this paper, we propose a new learning method by sampling strategy and model compression to overcome this challenge. Our approach has multifold advantages: 1) the adaptive sampling strategy largely suppresses the GCN training deviation over uniform sampling; 2) compressed GCN-based methods with a smaller scale of parameters need fewer labeled data to train; 3) the smaller scale of training data is beneficial to reduce the human resource cost to label them. We choose six popular GCN baselines and conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that by applying our method, all GCN baselines cut down the annotation requirement by as much as 90$\%$ and compress the scale of parameters more than 6$\times$ without sacrificing their strong performance. It verifies that the training method could extend the existing semi-supervised GCN-based methods to the scenarios with the extremely small scale of labeled data.",0

"We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for image classification. To learn target-domain-aware features from the unlabeled data, we create a self-supervised pretext task by augmenting the unlabeled data with a certain type of transformation (specifically, image rotation) and ask the learner to predict the properties of the transformation. However, the obtained feature representation may contain a large amount of irrelevant information with respect to the main task. To provide further guidance, we force the feature representation of the augmented data to be consistent with that of the original data. Intuitively, the consistency introduces additional constraints to representation learning, therefore, the learned representation is more likely to focus on the right information about the main task. Our experimental results validate the proposed method and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on classical domain adaptation benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Jiaolong/ss-da-consistency.",0

"Since its inception, the neural estimation of mutual information (MI) has demonstrated the empirical success of modeling expected dependency between high-dimensional random variables. However, MI is an aggregate statistic and cannot be used to measure point-wise dependency between different events. In this work, instead of estimating the expected dependency, we focus on estimating point-wise dependency (PD), which quantitatively measures how likely two outcomes co-occur. We show that we can naturally obtain PD when we are optimizing MI neural variational bounds. However, optimizing these bounds is challenging due to its large variance in practice. To address this issue, we develop two methods (free of optimizing MI variational bounds): Probabilistic Classifier and Density-Ratio Fitting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in 1) MI estimation, 2) self-supervised representation learning, and 3) cross-modal retrieval task.",0

"Improving sample efficiency is a key research problem in reinforcement learning (RL), and CURL, which uses contrastive learning to extract high-level features from raw pixels of individual video frames, is an efficient algorithm~\citep{srinivas2020curl}. We observe that consecutive video frames in a game are highly correlated but CURL deals with them independently. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a new algorithm, masked contrastive representation learning for RL, that takes the correlation among consecutive inputs into consideration. In addition to the CNN encoder and the policy network in CURL, our method introduces an auxiliary Transformer module to leverage the correlations among video frames. During training, we randomly mask the features of several frames, and use the CNN encoder and Transformer to reconstruct them based on the context frames. The CNN encoder and Transformer are jointly trained via contrastive learning where the reconstructed features should be similar to the ground-truth ones while dissimilar to others. During inference, the CNN encoder and the policy network are used to take actions, and the Transformer module is discarded.

"An important component of autoencoders is the method by which the information capacity of the latent representation is minimized or limited. In this work, the rank of the covariance matrix of the codes is implicitly minimized by relying on the fact that gradient descent learning in multi-layer linear networks leads to minimum-rank solutions. By inserting a number of extra linear layers between the encoder and the decoder, the system spontaneously learns representations with a low effective dimension.

"In this paper, we address self-supervised representation learning from human skeletons for action recognition. Previous methods, which usually learn feature presentations from a single reconstruction task, may come across the overfitting problem, and the features are not generalizable for action recognition. Instead, we propose to integrate multiple tasks to learn more general representations in a self-supervised manner. To realize this goal, we integrate motion prediction, jigsaw puzzle recognition, and contrastive learning to learn skeleton features from different aspects. Skeleton dynamics can be modeled through motion prediction by predicting the future sequence. And temporal patterns, which are critical for action recognition, are learned through solving jigsaw puzzles. We further regularize the feature space by contrastive learning. Besides, we explore different training strategies to utilize the knowledge from self-supervised tasks for action recognition. We evaluate our multi-task self-supervised learning approach with action classifiers trained under different configurations, including unsupervised, semi-supervised and fully-supervised settings.

"Representation Learning in a heterogeneous space with mixed variables of numerical and categorical types has interesting challenges due to its complex feature manifold. Moreover, feature learning in an unsupervised setup, without class labels and a suitable learning loss function, adds to the problem complexity. Further, the learned representation and subsequent predictions should not reflect discriminatory behavior towards certain sensitive groups or attributes. The proposed feature map should preserve maximum variations present in the data and needs to be fair with respect to the sensitive variables. We propose, in the first phase of our work, an efficient encoder-decoder framework to capture the mixed-domain information. The second phase of our work focuses on de-biasing the mixed space representations by adding relevant fairness constraints.

"In this paper, we study network representation learning for tripartite heterogeneous networks which learns node representation features for networks with three types of node entities. We argue that tripartite networks are common in real world applications, and the essential challenge of the representation learning is the heterogeneous relations between various node types and links in the network. To tackle the challenge, we develop a tripartite heterogeneous network embedding called TriNE. The method considers unique user-item-tag tripartite relationships, to build an objective function to model explicit relationships between nodes (observed links), and also capture implicit relationships between tripartite nodes (unobserved links across tripartite node sets). The method organizes metapath guided random walks to create heterogeneous neighborhood for all node types in the network. This information is then utilized to train a heterogeneous skip-gram model based on a joint optimization.

"Group re-identification (G-ReID) is an important yet less-studied task. Its challenges not only lie in appearance changes of individuals which have been well-investigated in general person re-identification (ReID), but also derive from group layout and membership changes. So the key task of G-ReID is to learn representations robust to such changes. To address this issue, we propose a Transferred Single and Couple Representation Learning Network (TSCN). Its merits are two aspects: 1) Due to the lack of labelled training samples, existing G-ReID methods mainly rely on unsatisfactory hand-crafted features. To gain the superiority of deep learning models, we treat a group as multiple persons and transfer the domain of a labeled ReID dataset to a G-ReID target dataset style to learn single representations. 2) Taking into account the neighborhood relationship in a group, we further propose learning a novel couple representation between two group members, that achieves more discriminative power in G-ReID tasks. In addition, an unsupervised weight learning method is exploited to adaptively fuse the results of different views together according to result patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 11.7\% CMC-1 on the Road Group dataset and by 39.0\% CMC-1 on the DukeMCMT dataset.",0

"Over the past decade, multivariate time series classification (MTSC) has received great attention with the advance of sensing techniques. Current deep learning methods for MTSC are based on convolutional and recurrent neural network, with the assumption that time series variables have the same effect to each other. Thus they cannot model the pairwise dependencies among variables explicitly. What's more, current spatial-temporal modeling methods based on GNNs are inherently flat and lack the capability of aggregating node information in a hierarchical manner. To address this limitation and attain expressive global representation of MTS, we propose a graph pooling based framework MTPool and view MTSC task as graph classification task. With graph structure learning and temporal convolution, MTS slices are converted to graphs and spatial-temporal features are extracted. Then, we propose a novel graph pooling method, which uses an ``encoder-decoder'' mechanism to generate adaptive centroids for cluster assignments. GNNs and graph pooling layers are used for joint graph representation learning and graph coarsening. With multiple graph pooling layers, the input graphs are hierachically coarsened to one node. Finally, differentiable classifier takes this coarsened one-node graph as input to get the final predicted class.

"Graph Neural Network (GNN) aggregates the neighborhood of each node into the node embedding and shows its powerful capability for graph representation learning.

We present a theoretical framework to design a continuous injective set function for neighborhood aggregation in GNN. Using the framework, we propose expressive GNN that aggregates the neighborhood of each node with a continuous injective set function, so that a GNN layer maps similar nodes with similar neighborhoods to similar embeddings, different nodes to different embeddings and the equivalent nodes or isomorphic graphs to the same embeddings. Moreover, the proposed expressive GNN can naturally learn expressive representations for graphs with continuous node attributes.

"An unsolved fundamental problem in biology and ecology is to predict observable traits (phenotypes) from a new genetic constitution (genotype) of an organism under environmental perturbations (e.g., drug treatment). The emergence of multiple omics data provides new opportunities but imposes great challenges in the predictive modeling of genotype-phenotype associations. Firstly, the high-dimensionality of genomics data and the lack of labeled data often make the existing supervised learning techniques less successful. Secondly, it is a challenging task to integrate heterogeneous omics data from different resources. Finally, the information transmission from DNA to phenotype involves multiple intermediate levels of RNA, protein, metabolite, etc. The higher-level features (e.g., gene expression) usually have stronger discriminative power than the lower level features (e.g., somatic mutation). To address above issues, we proposed a novel Cross-LEvel Information Transmission network (CLEIT) framework. CLEIT aims to explicitly model the asymmetrical multi-level organization of the biological system. Inspired by domain adaptation, CLEIT first learns the latent representation of high-level domain then uses it as ground-truth embedding to improve the representation learning of the low-level domain in the form of contrastive loss. In addition, we adopt a pre-training-fine-tuning approach to leveraging the unlabeled heterogeneous omics data to improve the generalizability of CLEIT. We demonstrate the effectiveness and performance boost of CLEIT in predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity from somatic mutations via the assistance of gene expressions when compared with state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Graphs are the most ubiquitous form of structured data representation used in machine learning. They model, however, only pairwise relations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order relations found in many real-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges. Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information. Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach, inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation, we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on representative benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the higher expressive power of HyperSAGE makes it more stable in learning node representations as compared to the alternatives.",0
"Machine learning commonly employs graphs as a means of structured data representation, yet graphs only account for pairwise relations between nodes and do not sufficiently capture the higher-order relations present in many real-world datasets.

"Meta-learning approaches have shown great success in vision and language domains. However, few studies discuss the practice of meta-learning for large-scale industrial applications. Although e-commerce companies have spent many efforts on learning representations to provide a better user experience, we argue that such efforts cannot be stopped at this step. In addition to learning a strong profile, the challenging question about how to effectively transfer the learned representation is raised simultaneously. This paper introduces the contributions that we made to address these challenges from three aspects. 1) Meta-learning model: In the context of representation learning with e-commerce user behavior data, we propose a meta-learning framework called the Meta-Profile Network, which extends the ideas of matching network and relation network for knowledge transfer and fast adaptation; 2) Encoding strategy: To keep high fidelity of large-scale long-term sequential behavior data, we propose a time-heatmap encoding strategy that allows the model to encode data effectively; 3) Deep network architecture: A multi-modal model combined with multi-task learning architecture is utilized to address the cross-domain knowledge learning and insufficient label problems. Moreover, we argue that an industrial model should not only have good performance in terms of accuracy, but also have better robustness and uncertainty performance under extreme conditions. We evaluate the performance of our model with extensive control experiments in various extreme scenarios, i.e. out-of-distribution detection, data insufficiency and class imbalance scenarios. The Meta-Profile Network shows significant improvement in the model performance when compared to baseline models.",0
"While meta-learning approaches have demonstrated success in the domains of vision and language, there is a lack of research on their application to large-scale industrial settings. Despite e-commerce companies' efforts to improve user experience by learning representations, it is important to consider how to transfer these representations effectively. This paper addresses these challenges through three contributions: 1) a meta-learning model called the Meta-Profile Network that utilizes matching and relation networks; 2) a time-heatmap encoding strategy to maintain the fidelity of long-term sequential behavior data; and 3) a multi-modal model utilizing multi-task learning architecture to overcome cross-domain knowledge learning and insufficient labeling challenges. The authors emphasize that industrial models must exhibit not only high accuracy but also robustness and uncertainty performance in extreme conditions. The Meta-Profile Network outperforms baseline models in various extreme scenarios, as demonstrated through extensive control experiments.",1
"Current autonomous driving systems are composed of a perception system and a decision system. Both of them are divided into multiple subsystems built up with lots of human heuristics. An end-to-end approach might clean up the system and avoid huge efforts of human engineering, as well as obtain better performance with increasing data and computation resources. Compared to the decision system, the perception system is more suitable to be designed in an end-to-end framework, since it does not require online driving exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for autonomous driving perception. A latent space is introduced to capture all relevant features useful for perception, which is learned through sequential latent representation learning. The learned end-to-end perception model is able to solve the detection, tracking, localization and mapping problems altogether with only minimum human engineering efforts and without storing any maps online. The proposed method is evaluated in a realistic urban driving simulator, with both camera image and lidar point cloud as sensor inputs. The codes and videos of this work are available at our github repo and project website.",0

"Disentangled representation learning has undoubtedly benefited from objective function surgery. However, a delicate balancing act of tuning is still required in order to trade off reconstruction fidelity versus disentanglement. Building on previous successes of penalizing the total correlation in the latent variables, we propose TCWAE (Total Correlation Wasserstein Autoencoder). Working in the WAE paradigm naturally enables the separation of the total-correlation term, thus providing disentanglement control over the learned representation, while offering more flexibility in the choice of reconstruction cost. We propose two variants using different KL estimators and perform extensive quantitative comparisons on data sets with known generative factors, showing competitive results relative to state-of-the-art techniques. We further study the trade off between disentanglement and reconstruction on more-difficult data sets with unknown generative factors, where the flexibility of the WAE paradigm in the reconstruction term improves reconstructions.",0

"Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match a target person across camera views at different locations and times. Existing Re-ID studies focus on the short-term cloth-consistent setting, under which a person re-appears in different camera views with the same outfit. A discriminative feature representation learned by existing deep Re-ID models is thus dominated by the visual appearance of clothing. In this work, we focus on a much more difficult yet practical setting where person matching is conducted over long-duration, e.g., over days and months and therefore inevitably under the new challenge of changing clothes. This problem, termed Long-Term Cloth-Changing (LTCC) Re-ID is much understudied due to the lack of large scale datasets. The first contribution of this work is a new LTCC dataset containing people captured over a long period of time with frequent clothing changes. As a second contribution, we propose a novel Re-ID method specifically designed to address the cloth-changing challenge. Specifically, we consider that under cloth-changes, soft-biometrics such as body shape would be more reliable. We, therefore, introduce a shape embedding module as well as a cloth-elimination shape-distillation module aiming to eliminate the now unreliable clothing appearance features and focus on the body shape information. Extensive experiments show that superior performance is achieved by the proposed model on the new LTCC dataset. The code and dataset will be available at https://naiq.github.io/LTCC_Perosn_ReID.html.",0
"The objective of Person re-identification (Re-ID) is to identify an individual across various camera views, locations, and times. Previous Re-ID studies have primarily focused on the short-term cloth-consistent scenario, where individuals appear in different camera views wearing the same clothing. Consequently, the deep Re-ID models used in these studies rely heavily on visual clothing appearance for discriminative feature representation.

"Lifelong learning has attracted much attention, but existing works still struggle to fight catastrophic forgetting and accumulate knowledge over long stretches of incremental learning. In this work, we propose PODNet, a model inspired by representation learning. By carefully balancing the compromise between remembering the old classes and learning new ones, PODNet fights catastrophic forgetting, even over very long runs of small incremental tasks --a setting so far unexplored by current works. PODNet innovates on existing art with an efficient spatial-based distillation-loss applied throughout the model and a representation comprising multiple proxy vectors for each class. We validate those innovations thoroughly, comparing PODNet with three state-of-the-art models on three datasets: CIFAR100, ImageNet100, and ImageNet1000. Our results showcase a significant advantage of PODNet over existing art, with accuracy gains of 12.10, 6.51, and 2.85 percentage points, respectively.

"In graph neural networks (GNNs), pooling operators compute local summaries of input graphs to capture their global properties, and they are fundamental for building deep GNNs that learn hierarchical representations. In this work, we propose the Node Decimation Pooling (NDP), a pooling operator for GNNs that generates coarser graphs while preserving the overall graph topology. During training, the GNN learns new node representations and fits them to a pyramid of coarsened graphs, which is computed offline in a pre-processing stage. NDP consists of three steps. First, a node decimation procedure selects the nodes belonging to one side of the partition identified by a spectral algorithm that approximates the \maxcut{} solution. Afterwards, the selected nodes are connected with Kron reduction to form the coarsened graph. Finally, since the resulting graph is very dense, we apply a sparsification procedure that prunes the adjacency matrix of the coarsened graph to reduce the computational cost in the GNN. Notably, we show that it is possible to remove many edges without significantly altering the graph structure. Experimental results show that NDP is more efficient compared to state-of-the-art graph pooling operators while reaching, at the same time, competitive performance on a significant variety of graph classification tasks.",0

"We develop a technique for generating smooth and accurate 3D human pose and motion estimates from RGB video sequences. Our method, which we call Motion Estimation via Variational Autoencoder (MEVA), decomposes a temporal sequence of human motion into a smooth motion representation using auto-encoder-based motion compression and a residual representation learned through motion refinement. This two-step encoding of human motion captures human motion in two stages: a general human motion estimation step that captures the coarse overall motion, and a residual estimation that adds back person-specific motion details. Experiments show that our method produces both smooth and accurate 3D human pose and motion estimates.",0

This representation is empirically robust to stochasticity and suitable for novelty detection from the error of a predictive forward model. We consider episodic and life-long uncertainties to guide the exploration. We propose to estimate the missing information about the environment with the world model, which operates in the learned latent space. As a motivation of the method, we analyse the exploration problem in a tabular Partially Observable Labyrinth.

"Contrastive learning has been adopted as a core method for unsupervised visual representation learning. Without human annotation, the common practice is to perform an instance discrimination task: Given a query image crop, this task labels crops from the same image as positives, and crops from other randomly sampled images as negatives. An important limitation of this label assignment strategy is that it can not reflect the heterogeneous similarity between the query crop and each crop from other images, taking them as equally negative, while some of them may even belong to the same semantic class as the query. To address this issue, inspired by consistency regularization in semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data, we propose Consistent Contrast (CO2), which introduces a consistency regularization term into the current contrastive learning framework. Regarding the similarity of the query crop to each crop from other images as ""unlabeled"", the consistency term takes the corresponding similarity of a positive crop as a pseudo label, and encourages consistency between these two similarities. Empirically, CO2 improves Momentum Contrast (MoCo) by 2.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet linear protocol, 3.8% and 1.1% top-5 accuracy on 1% and 10% labeled semi-supervised settings. It also transfers to image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC. This shows that CO2 learns better visual representations for these downstream tasks.",0
"Unsupervised visual representation learning commonly employs contrastive learning as a fundamental method. In the absence of human annotation, instance discrimination is usually conducted, where a query image crop is labeled as positive and crops from other images are labeled as negative. Nonetheless, this labeling method is limited as it does not account for the heterogeneous similarity between the query crop and other crops from different images, assuming them to be equally negative, despite some belonging to the same semantic class as the query crop. To address this issue, we propose Consistent Contrast (CO2) by incorporating a consistency regularization term in the current contrastive learning framework, inspired by consistency regularization in semi-supervised learning. This term treats the similarity of the query crop to crops from other images as unlabeled and uses the similarity of a positive crop as a pseudo label to ensure consistency between the two similarities. Results indicate that CO2 enhances Momentum Contrast (MoCo) by improving top-1 accuracy on ImageNet linear protocol by 2.9%, and top-5 accuracy on 1% and 10% labeled semi-supervised settings by 3.8% and 1.1%, respectively.

"Contrastive approaches to representation learning have recently shown great promise. In contrast to generative approaches, these contrastive models learn a deterministic encoder with no notion of uncertainty or confidence. In this paper, we introduce a simple approach based on ""contrasting distributions"" that learns to assign uncertainty for pretrained contrastive representations. In particular, we train a deep network from a representation to a distribution in representation space, whose variance can be used as a measure of confidence. In our experiments, we show that this deep uncertainty model can be used (1) to visually interpret model behavior, (2) to detect new noise in the input to deployed models, (3) to detect anomalies, where we outperform 10 baseline methods across 11 tasks with improvements of up to 14% absolute, and (4) to classify out-of-distribution examples where our fully unsupervised model is competitive with supervised methods.",0

"Multivariate time series (MTS) data are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in diverse domains, e.g., IoT systems, health informatics, and 5G networks. To obtain an effective representation of MTS data, it is not only essential to consider unpredictable dynamics and highly variable lengths of these data but also important to address the irregularities in the sampling rates of MTS. Existing parametric approaches rely on manual hyperparameter tuning and may cost a huge amount of labor effort. Therefore, it is desirable to learn the representation automatically and efficiently. To this end, we propose an autonomous representation learning approach for multivariate time series (TimeAutoML) with irregular sampling rates and variable lengths. As opposed to previous works, we first present a representation learning pipeline in which the configuration and hyperparameter optimization are fully automatic and can be tailored for various tasks, e.g., anomaly detection, clustering, etc. Next, a negative sample generation approach and an auxiliary classification task are developed and integrated within TimeAutoML to enhance its representation capability. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TimeAutoML outperforms competing approaches on various tasks by a large margin. In fact, it achieves the best anomaly detection performance among all comparison algorithms on 78 out of all 85 UCR datasets, acquiring up to 20% performance improvement in terms of AUC score.",0

"It has been demonstrated that hidden representation learned by a deep model can encode private information of the input, hence can be exploited to recover such information with reasonable accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Differentially Private Neural Representation (DPNR) to preserve the privacy of the extracted representation from text. DPNR utilises Differential Privacy (DP) to provide a formal privacy guarantee. Further, we show that masking words via dropout can further enhance privacy. To maintain utility of the learned representation, we integrate DP-noisy representation into a robust training process to derive a robust target model, which also helps for model fairness over various demographic variables.

"We present MIX'EM, a novel solution for unsupervised image classification. MIX'EM generates representations that by themselves are sufficient to drive a general-purpose clustering algorithm to deliver high-quality classification. This is accomplished by building a mixture of embeddings module into a contrastive visual representation learning framework in order to disentangle representations at the category level. It first generates a set of embedding and mixing coefficients from a given visual representation, and then combines them into a single embedding. We introduce three techniques to successfully train MIX'EM and avoid degenerate solutions; (i) diversify mixture components by maximizing entropy, (ii) minimize instance conditioned component entropy to enforce a clustered embedding space, and (iii) use an associative embedding loss to enforce semantic separability. By applying (i) and (ii), semantic categories emerge through the mixture coefficients, making it possible to apply (iii). Subsequently, we run K-means on the representations to acquire semantic classification. We conduct extensive experiments and analyses on STL10, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100-20 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 78\%, 82\%, and 44\%, respectively.

"Reinforcement learning with function approximation can be unstable and even divergent, especially when combined with off-policy learning and Bellman updates. In deep reinforcement learning, these issues have been dealt with empirically by adapting and regularizing the representation, in particular with auxiliary tasks. This suggests that representation learning may provide a means to guarantee stability. In this paper, we formally show that there are indeed nontrivial state representations under which the canonical TD algorithm is stable, even when learning off-policy. We analyze representation learning schemes that are based on the transition matrix of a policy, such as proto-value functions, along three axes: approximation error, stability, and ease of estimation. In the most general case, we show that a Schur basis provides convergence guarantees, but is difficult to estimate from samples. For a fixed reward function, we find that an orthogonal basis of the corresponding Krylov subspace is an even better choice. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that these stable representations can be learned using stochastic gradient descent, opening the door to improved techniques for representation learning with deep networks.",0

"This paper challenges the common assumption that the weight $\beta$, in $\beta$-VAE, should be larger than $1$ in order to effectively disentangle latent factors. We demonstrate that $\beta$-VAE, with $\beta < 1$, can not only attain good disentanglement but also significantly improve reconstruction accuracy via dynamic control. The paper removes the inherent trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and disentanglement for $\beta$-VAE. Existing methods, such as $\beta$-VAE and FactorVAE, assign a large weight to the KL-divergence term in the objective function, leading to high reconstruction errors for the sake of better disentanglement. To mitigate this problem, a ControlVAE has recently been developed that dynamically tunes the KL-divergence weight in an attempt to control the trade-off to more a favorable point. However, ControlVAE fails to eliminate the conflict between the need for a large $\beta$ (for disentanglement) and the need for a small $\beta$. Instead, we propose DynamicVAE that maintains a different $\beta$ at different stages of training, thereby decoupling disentanglement and reconstruction accuracy. In order to evolve the weight, $\beta$, along a trajectory that enables such decoupling, DynamicVAE leverages a modified incremental PI (proportional-integral) controller, and employs a moving average as well as a hybrid annealing method to evolve the value of KL-divergence smoothly in a tightly controlled fashion. We theoretically prove the stability of the proposed approach. Evaluation results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DynamicVAE significantly improves the reconstruction accuracy while achieving disentanglement comparable to the best of existing methods. The results verify that our method can separate disentangled representation learning and reconstruction, removing the inherent tension between the two.",0

"Events in natural videos typically arise from spatio-temporal interactions between actors and objects and involve multiple co-occurring activities and object classes. To capture this rich visual and semantic context, we propose using two graphs: (1) an attributed spatio-temporal visual graph whose nodes correspond to actors and objects and whose edges encode different types of interactions, and (2) a symbolic graph that models semantic relationships. We further propose a graph neural network for refining the representations of actors, objects and their interactions on the resulting hybrid graph. Our model goes beyond current approaches that assume nodes and edges are of the same type, operate on graphs with fixed edge weights and do not use a symbolic graph. In particular, our framework: a) has specialized attention-based message functions for different node and edge types; b) uses visual edge features; c) integrates visual evidence with label relationships; and d) performs global reasoning in the semantic space. Experiments on challenging video understanding tasks, such as temporal action localization on the Charades dataset, show that the proposed method leads to state-of-the-art performance.",0

"Automatically finding good and general remote sensing representations allows to perform transfer learning on a wide range of applications - improving the accuracy and reducing the required number of training samples. This paper investigates development of generic remote sensing representations, and explores which characteristics are important for a dataset to be a good source for representation learning. For this analysis, five diverse remote sensing datasets are selected and used for both, disjoint upstream representation learning and downstream model training and evaluation. A common evaluation protocol is used to establish baselines for these datasets that achieve state-of-the-art performance. As the results indicate, especially with a low number of available training samples a significant performance enhancement can be observed when including additionally in-domain data in comparison to training models from scratch or fine-tuning only on ImageNet (up to 11% and 40%, respectively, at 100 training samples).

"Event-based cameras record an asynchronous stream of per-pixel brightness changes. As such, they have numerous advantages over the standard frame-based cameras, including high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. Due to the asynchronous nature, efficient learning of compact representation for event data is challenging. While it remains not explored the extent to which the spatial and temporal event ""information"" is useful for pattern recognition tasks. In this paper, we focus on single-layer architectures. We analyze the performance of two general problem formulations: the direct and the inverse, for unsupervised feature learning from local event data (local volumes of events described in space-time). We identify and show the main advantages of each approach. Theoretically, we analyze guarantees for an optimal solution, possibility for asynchronous, parallel parameter update, and the computational complexity. We present numerical experiments for object recognition. We evaluate the solution under the direct and the inverse problem and give a comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, learning efficient representations from event data is challenging due to its asynchronous nature. The usefulness of spatial and temporal event information for pattern recognition tasks remains unexplored. In this study, we focus on single-layer architectures and analyze two problem formulations: direct and inverse, for unsupervised feature learning from local event data. We identify the advantages of each approach, analyze guarantees for optimal solutions, and assess computational complexity. Our experiments on object recognition show that both approaches offer advantages for representation learning from event data, with up to 9% improvement in recognition accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",1
"We propose a novel framework, called Markov-Lipschitz deep learning (MLDL), to tackle geometric deterioration caused by collapse, twisting, or crossing in vector-based neural network transformations for manifold-based representation learning and manifold data generation. A prior constraint, called locally isometric smoothness (LIS), is imposed across-layers and encoded into a Markov random field (MRF)-Gibbs distribution. This leads to the best possible solutions for local geometry preservation and robustness as measured by locally geometric distortion and locally bi-Lipschitz continuity. Consequently, the layer-wise vector transformations are enhanced into well-behaved, LIS-constrained metric homeomorphisms. Extensive experiments, comparisons, and ablation study demonstrate significant advantages of MLDL for manifold learning and manifold data generation. MLDL is general enough to enhance any vector transformation-based networks. The code is available at https://github.com/westlake-cairi/Markov-Lipschitz-Deep-Learning.",0

"The current research focus on Content-Based Video Retrieval requires higher-level video representation describing the long-range semantic dependencies of relevant incidents, events, etc. However, existing methods commonly process the frames of a video as individual images or short clips, making the modeling of long-range semantic dependencies difficult. In this paper, we propose TCA (Temporal Context Aggregation for Video Retrieval), a video representation learning framework that incorporates long-range temporal information between frame-level features using the self-attention mechanism. To train it on video retrieval datasets, we propose a supervised contrastive learning method that performs automatic hard negative mining and utilizes the memory bank mechanism to increase the capacity of negative samples. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple video retrieval tasks, such as CC_WEB_VIDEO, FIVR-200K, and EVVE.

"We present HERO, a novel framework for large-scale video+language omni-representation learning. HERO encodes multimodal inputs in a hierarchical structure, where local context of a video frame is captured by a Cross-modal Transformer via multimodal fusion, and global video context is captured by a Temporal Transformer.

How to use representation learning to improve the performance of classifiers is a very significance research direction. We using representation learning technology to map raw data(node of graph) to a low-dimensional feature space. In this space, each raw data obtained a lower dimensional vector representation, we do some simple linear operations for those vectors to produce some virtual data, using those vectors and virtual data to training multi-tag classifier.

"Source code representations are key in applying machine learning techniques for processing and analyzing programs.

"Recently, there is an increasing demand for automatically detecting anatomical landmarks which provide rich structural information to facilitate subsequent medical image analysis. Current methods related to this task often leverage the power of deep neural networks, while a major challenge in fine tuning such models in medical applications arises from insufficient number of labeled samples. To address this, we propose to regularize the knowledge transfer across source and target tasks through cross-task representation learning. The proposed method is demonstrated for extracting facial anatomical landmarks which facilitate the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. The source and target tasks in this work are face recognition and landmark detection, respectively. The main idea of the proposed method is to retain the feature representations of the source model on the target task data, and to leverage them as an additional source of supervisory signals for regularizing the target model learning, thereby improving its performance under limited training samples. Concretely, we present two approaches for the proposed representation learning by constraining either final or intermediate model features on the target model.

"We consider the problem of representation learning for temporal interaction graphs where a network of entities with complex interactions over an extended period of time is modeled as a graph with a rich set of node and edge attributes. In particular, an edge between a node-pair within the graph corresponds to a multi-dimensional time-series. To fully capture and model the dynamics of the network, we propose GTEA, a framework of representation learning for temporal interaction graphs with per-edge time-based aggregation. Under GTEA, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is integrated with a state-of-the-art sequence model, such as LSTM, Transformer and their time-aware variants. The sequence model generates edge embeddings to encode temporal interaction patterns between each pair of nodes, while the GNN-based backbone learns the topological dependencies and relationships among different nodes. GTEA also incorporates a sparsity-inducing self-attention mechanism to distinguish and focus on the more important neighbors of each node during the aggregation process. By capturing temporal interactive dynamics together with multi-dimensional node and edge attributes in a network, GTEA can learn fine-grained representations for a temporal interaction graph to enable or facilitate other downstream data analytic tasks. Experimental results show that GTEA outperforms state-of-the-art schemes including GraphSAGE, APPNP, and TGAT by delivering higher accuracy (100.00%, 98.51%, 98.05% ,79.90%) and macro-F1 score (100.00%, 98.51%, 96.68% ,79.90%) over four large-scale real-world datasets for binary/ multi-class node classification.",0

Specifically, we construct variational auto-encoders (VAE) for the two domains, and form bidirectional transitions by cross-grafting the VAEs' decoder stacks. Furthermore, generative adversarial networks (GAN) are employed for domain adaptation, mapping the target domain data to the known label space of the source domain. The overall adaptation process hence consists of three phases: feature representation learning by VAEs, transitions generation, and transitions alignment by GANs.

However, the collection and annotation of a large dataset are costly and time-consuming. To avoid the same, there has been a lot of research going on in the field of unsupervised visual representation learning especially in a self-supervised setting.

"Representation learning has been proven to play an important role in the unprecedented success of machine learning models in numerous tasks, such as machine translation, face recognition and recommendation. The majority of existing representation learning approaches often require a large number of consistent and noise-free labels. However, due to various reasons such as budget constraints and privacy concerns, labels are very limited in many real-world scenarios. Directly applying standard representation learning approaches on small labeled data sets will easily run into over-fitting problems and lead to sub-optimal solutions. Even worse, in some domains such as education, the limited labels are usually annotated by multiple workers with diverse expertise, which yields noises and inconsistency in such crowdsourcing settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which aims to learn effective representations from limited data with crowdsourced labels. Specifically, we design a grouping based deep neural network to learn embeddings from a limited number of training samples and present a Bayesian confidence estimator to capture the inconsistency among crowdsourced labels. Furthermore, to expedite the training process, we develop a hard example selection procedure to adaptively pick up training examples that are misclassified by the model.

"Representation learning is a fundamental building block for analyzing entities in a database.

This paper introduces an automated skill acquisition framework in reinforcement learning which involves identifying a hierarchical description of the given task in terms of abstract states and extended actions between abstract states. Identifying such structures present in the task provides ways to simplify and speed up reinforcement learning algorithms. These structures also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks without relearning policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to find metastable regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. The spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractions aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in terms of the sequence of actions that lead to transitions between such abstract states. The connectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or options. These skills are independent of the learning task and can be efficiently reused across a variety of tasks defined over the same model. This approach works well even without the exact model of the environment by using sample trajectories to construct an approximate estimate. We also present our approach to scaling the skill acquisition framework to complex tasks with large state spaces for which we perform state aggregation using the representation learned from an action conditional video prediction network and use the skill acquisition framework on the aggregated state space.,0

"Axis-aligned decision forests have long been the leading class of machine learning algorithms for modeling tabular data. In many applications of machine learning such as learning-to-rank, decision forests deliver remarkable performance. They also possess other coveted characteristics such as interpretability. Despite their widespread use and rich history, decision forests to date fail to consume raw structured data such as text, or learn effective representations for them, a factor behind the success of deep neural networks in recent years. While there exist methods that construct smoothed decision forests to achieve representation learning, the resulting models are decision forests in name only: They are no longer axis-aligned, use stochastic decisions, or are not interpretable. Furthermore, none of the existing methods are appropriate for problems that require a Transfer Learning treatment. In this work, we present a novel but intuitive proposal to achieve representation learning for decision forests without imposing new restrictions or necessitating structural changes. Our model is simply a decision forest, possibly trained using any forest learning algorithm, atop a deep neural network. By approximating the gradients of the decision forest through input perturbation, a purely analytical procedure, the decision forest directs the neural network to learn or fine-tune representations. Our framework has the advantage that it is applicable to any arbitrary decision forest and that it allows the use of arbitrary deep neural networks for representation learning. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposal through experiments on synthetic and benchmark classification datasets.",0

"Recently, the interest of graph representation learning has been rapidly increasing in recommender systems. However, most existing studies have focused on improving accuracy, but in real-world systems, the recommendation diversity should be considered as well to improve user experiences. In this paper, we propose the diversity-emphasized node embedding div2vec, which is a random walk-based unsupervised learning method like DeepWalk and node2vec. When generating random walks, DeepWalk and node2vec sample nodes of higher degree more and nodes of lower degree less. On the other hand, div2vec samples nodes with the probability inversely proportional to its degree so that every node can evenly belong to the collection of random walks. This strategy improves the diversity of recommendation models. Offline experiments on the MovieLens dataset showed that our new method improves the recommendation performance in terms of both accuracy and diversity. Moreover, we evaluated the proposed model on two real-world services, WATCHA and LINE Wallet Coupon, and observed the div2vec improves the recommendation quality by diversifying the system.",0

"Video representation learning has recently attracted attention in computer vision due to its applications for activity and scene forecasting or vision-based planning and control. Video prediction models often learn a latent representation of video which is encoded from input frames and decoded back into images. Even when conditioned on actions, purely deep learning based architectures typically lack a physically interpretable latent space. In this study, we use a differentiable physics engine within an action-conditional video representation network to learn a physical latent representation. We propose supervised and self-supervised learning methods to train our network and identify physical properties. The latter uses spatial transformers to decode physical states back into images. The simulation scenarios in our experiments comprise pushing, sliding and colliding objects, for which we also analyze the observability of the physical properties. In experiments we demonstrate that our network can learn to encode images and identify physical properties like mass and friction from videos and action sequences in the simulated scenarios. We evaluate the accuracy of our supervised and self-supervised methods and compare it with a system identification baseline which directly learns from state trajectories.

Video prediction models typically learn a latent representation of video, which is encoded from input frames and decoded back into images. However, deep learning-based architectures lack a physically interpretable latent space, even when conditioned on actions. This study proposes the use of a differentiable physics engine to learn a physical latent representation within an action-conditional video representation network. The network is trained using supervised and self-supervised learning methods to identify physical properties, with the latter using spatial transformers to decode physical states back into images. The experiments involve simulation scenarios such as pushing, sliding and colliding objects, and the observability of physical properties is analyzed. The results demonstrate that the network can learn to encode images and identify physical properties such as mass and friction from videos and action sequences in simulated scenarios. The accuracy of the supervised and self-supervised methods is evaluated and compared with a system identification baseline that directly learns from state trajectories. Additionally, the network's ability to predict future video frames from input images and actions is demonstrated.",1
"The heterogeneous network is a robust data abstraction that can model entities of different types interacting in various ways. Such heterogeneity brings rich semantic information but presents nontrivial challenges in aggregating the heterogeneous relationships between objects - especially those of higher-order indirect relations. Recent graph neural network approaches for representation learning on heterogeneous networks typically employ the attention mechanism, which is often only optimized for predictions based on direct links. Furthermore, even though most deep learning methods can aggregate higher-order information by building deeper models, such a scheme can diminish the degree of interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we explore an architecture - Layer-stacked ATTention Embedding (LATTE) - that automatically decomposes higher-order meta relations at each layer to extract the relevant heterogeneous neighborhood structures for each node. Additionally, by successively stacking layer representations, the learned node embedding offers a more interpretable aggregation scheme for nodes of different types at different neighborhood ranges. We conducted experiments on several benchmark heterogeneous network datasets. In both transductive and inductive node classification tasks, LATTE can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing approaches, all while offering a lightweight model. With extensive experimental analyses and visualizations, the framework can demonstrate the ability to extract informative insights on heterogeneous networks.",0

"We propose a webly-supervised representation learning method that does not suffer from the annotation unscalability of supervised learning, nor the computation unscalability of self-supervised learning. Most existing works on webly-supervised representation learning adopt a vanilla supervised learning method without accounting for the prevalent noise in the training data, whereas most prior methods in learning with label noise are less effective for real-world large-scale noisy data. We propose momentum prototypes (MoPro), a simple contrastive learning method that achieves online label noise correction, out-of-distribution sample removal, and representation learning. MoPro achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebVision, a weakly-labeled noisy dataset. MoPro also shows superior performance when the pretrained model is transferred to down-stream image classification and detection tasks. It outperforms the ImageNet supervised pretrained model by +10.5 on 1-shot classification on VOC, and outperforms the best self-supervised pretrained model by +17.3 when finetuned on 1\% of ImageNet labeled samples. Furthermore, MoPro is more robust to distribution shifts. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/salesforce/MoPro.",0

"The diagnosis process of colorectal cancer mainly focuses on the localization and characterization of abnormal growths in the colon tissue known as polyps. Despite recent advances in deep object localization, the localization of polyps remains challenging due to the similarities between tissues, and the high level of artifacts. Recent studies have shown the negative impact of the presence of artifacts in the polyp detection task, and have started to take them into account within the training process. However, the use of prior knowledge related to the spatial interaction of polyps and artifacts has not yet been considered. In this work, we incorporate artifact knowledge in a post-processing step. Our method models this task as an inductive graph representation learning problem, and is composed of training and inference steps. Detected bounding boxes around polyps and artifacts are considered as nodes connected by a defined criterion. The training step generates a node classifier with ground truth bounding boxes. In inference, we use this classifier to analyze a second graph, generated from artifact and polyp predictions given by region proposal networks. We evaluate how the choices in the connectivity and artifacts affect the performance of our method and show that it has the potential to reduce the false positives in the results of a region proposal network.",0

"Unsupervised (or self-supervised) graph representation learning is essential to facilitate various graph data mining tasks when external supervision is unavailable. The challenge is to encode the information about the graph structure and the attributes associated with the nodes and edges into a low dimensional space. Most existing unsupervised methods promote similar representations across nodes that are topologically close. Recently, it was shown that leveraging additional graph-level information, e.g., information that is shared among all nodes, encourages the representations to be mindful of the global properties of the graph, which greatly improves their quality. However, in most graphs, there is significantly more structure that can be captured, e.g., nodes tend to belong to (multiple) clusters that represent structurally similar nodes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graph representation learning method called Graph InfoClust (GIC), that seeks to additionally capture cluster-level information content. These clusters are computed by a differentiable K-means method and are jointly optimized by maximizing the mutual information between nodes of the same clusters. This optimization leads the node representations to capture richer information and nodal interactions, which improves their quality. Experiments show that GIC outperforms state-of-art methods in various downstream tasks (node classification, link prediction, and node clustering) with a 0.9% to 6.1% gain over the best competing approach, on average.",0

"The random subspace method, known as the pillar of random forests, is good at making precise and robust predictions. However, there is not a straightforward way yet to combine it with deep learning. In this paper, we therefore propose Neural Random Subspace (NRS), a novel deep learning based random subspace method.

"Although supervised deep representation learning has attracted enormous attentions across areas of pattern recognition and computer vision, little progress has been made towards unsupervised deep representation learning for image clustering. In this paper, we propose a deep spectral analysis network for unsupervised representation learning and image clustering. While spectral analysis is established with solid theoretical foundations and has been widely applied to unsupervised data mining, its essential weakness lies in the fact that it is difficult to construct a proper affinity matrix and determine the involving Laplacian matrix for a given dataset. In this paper, we propose a SA-Net to overcome these weaknesses and achieve improved image clustering by extending the spectral analysis procedure into a deep learning framework with multiple layers. The SA-Net has the capability to learn deep representations and reveal deep correlations among data samples. Compared with the existing spectral analysis, the SA-Net achieves two advantages: (i) Given the fact that one spectral analysis procedure can only deal with one subset of the given dataset, our proposed SA-Net elegantly integrates multiple parallel and consecutive spectral analysis procedures together to enable interactive learning across different units towards a coordinated clustering model; (ii) Our SA-Net can identify the local similarities among different images at patch level and hence achieves a higher level of robustness against occlusions. Extensive experiments on a number of popular datasets support that our proposed SA-Net outperforms 11 benchmarks across a number of image clustering applications.",0

"Deep representation learning is a crucial procedure in multimedia analysis and attracts increasing attention.

"While supervised deep learning has achieved great success in a range of applications, relatively little work has studied the discovery of knowledge from unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning framework to provide a potential solution for the problem that existing deep learning techniques require large labeled data sets for completing the training process. Our proposed introduces a new principle of joint learning on both deep representations and GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)-based deep modeling, and thus an integrated objective function is proposed to facilitate the principle. In comparison with the existing work in similar areas, our objective function has two learning targets, which are created to be jointly optimized to achieve the best possible unsupervised learning and knowledge discovery from unlabeled data sets. While maximizing the first target enables the GMM to achieve the best possible modeling of the data representations and each Gaussian component corresponds to a compact cluster, maximizing the second term will enhance the separability of the Gaussian components and hence the inter-cluster distances. As a result, the compactness of clusters is significantly enhanced by reducing the intra-cluster distances, and the separability is improved by increasing the inter-cluster distances. Extensive experimental results show that the propose method can improve the clustering performance compared with benchmark methods.",0

"Learning to infer graph representations and performing spatial reasoning in a complex surgical environment can play a vital role in surgical scene understanding in robotic surgery. For this purpose, we develop an approach to generate the scene graph and predict surgical interactions between instruments and surgical region of interest (ROI) during robot-assisted surgery. We design an attention link function and integrate with a graph parsing network to recognize the surgical interactions. To embed each node with corresponding neighbouring node features, we further incorporate SageConv into the network. The scene graph generation and active edge classification mostly depend on the embedding or feature extraction of node and edge features from complex image representation. Here, we empirically demonstrate the feature extraction methods by employing label smoothing weighted loss. Smoothing the hard label can avoid the over-confident prediction of the model and enhances the feature representation learned by the penultimate layer. To obtain the graph scene label, we annotate the bounding box and the instrument-ROI interactions on the robotic scene segmentation challenge 2018 dataset with an experienced clinical expert in robotic surgery and employ it to evaluate our propositions.",0

"Transportation systems often rely on understanding the flow of vehicles or pedestrian. From traffic monitoring at the city scale, to commuters in train terminals, recent progress in sensing technology make it possible to use cameras to better understand the demand, i.e., better track moving agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians). Whether the cameras are mounted on drones, vehicles, or fixed in the built environments, they inevitably remain scatter. We need to develop the technology to re-identify the same agents across images captured from non-overlapping field-of-views, referred to as the visual re-identification task. State-of-the-art methods learn a neural network based representation trained with the cross-entropy loss function. We argue that such loss function is not suited for the visual re-identification task hence propose to model confidence in the representation learning framework. We show the impact of our confidence-based learning framework with three methods: label smoothing, confidence penalty, and deep variational information bottleneck. They all show a boost in performance validating our claim. Our contribution is generic to any agent of interest, i.e., vehicles or pedestrians, and outperform highly specialized state-of-the-art methods across 5 datasets.

"In deep representational learning, it is often desired to isolate a particular factor (termed {\em content}) from other factors (referred to as {\em style}). What constitutes the content is typically specified by users through explicit labels in the data, while all unlabeled/unknown factors are regarded as style. Recently, it has been shown that such content-labeled data can be effectively exploited by modifying the deep latent factor models (e.g., VAE) such that the style and content are well separated in the latent representations. However, the approach assumes that the content factor is categorical-valued (e.g., subject ID in face image data, or digit class in the MNIST dataset). In certain situations, the content is ordinal-valued, that is, the values the content factor takes are {\em ordered} rather than categorical, making content-labeled VAEs, including the latent space they infer, suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of VAE that imposes a partially ordered set (poset) structure in the content latent space, while simultaneously making it aligned with the ordinal content values. To this end, instead of the iid Gaussian latent prior adopted in prior approaches, we introduce a conditional Gaussian spacing prior model. This model admits a tractable joint Gaussian prior, but also effectively places negligible density values on the content latent configurations that violate the poset constraint. To evaluate this model, we consider two specific ordinal structured problems: estimating a subject's age in a face image and elucidating the calorie amount in a food meal image. We demonstrate significant improvements in content-style separation over previous non-ordinal approaches.",0

"Deep neural networks have shown exceptional learning capability and generalizability in the source domain when massive labeled data is provided. However, the well-trained models often fail in the target domain due to the domain shift. Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to improve network performance when applying robust models trained on medical images from source domains to a new target domain. In this work, we present an approach based on the Wasserstein distance guided disentangled representation to achieve 3D multi-domain liver segmentation. Concretely, we embed images onto a shared content space capturing shared feature-level information across domains and domain-specific appearance spaces. The existing mutual information-based representation learning approaches often fail to capture complete representations in multi-domain medical imaging tasks. To mitigate these issues, we utilize Wasserstein distance to learn more complete representation, and introduces a content discriminator to further facilitate the representation disentanglement.

"Graph neural networks (GNN), as a popular methodology for node representation learning on graphs, currently mainly focus on preserving the smoothness and identifiability of node representations. A robust node representation on graphs should further hold the stability property which means a node representation is resistant to slight perturbations on the input. In this paper, we introduce the stability of node representations in addition to the smoothness and identifiability, and develop a novel method called contrastive graph neural networks (CGNN) that learns robust node representations in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, CGNN maintains the stability and identifiability by a contrastive learning objective, while preserving the smoothness with existing GNN models. Furthermore, the proposed method is a generic framework that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN, GraphSage and GAT).

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are emerging machine learning models on graphs. One key property behind the expressiveness of existing GNNs is that the learned node representations are permutation-equivariant. Though being a desirable property for certain tasks, however, permutation-equivariance prevents GNNs from being proximity-aware, i.e., preserving the walk-based proximities between pairs of nodes, which is another critical property for graph analytical tasks. On the other hand, some variants of GNNs are proposed to preserve node proximities, but they fail to maintain permutation-equivariance. How to empower GNNs to be proximity-aware while maintaining permutation-equivariance remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose Stochastic Message Passing (SMP), a general and simple GNN to maintain both proximity-awareness and permutation-equivariance properties. Specifically, we augment the existing GNNs with stochastic node representations learned to preserve node proximities. Though seemingly simple, we prove that such a mechanism can enable GNNs to preserve node proximities in theory while maintaining permutation-equivariance with certain parametrization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMP for tasks including node classification and link prediction.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a type of machine learning model designed for graphs. One of the reasons existing GNNs are effective is because the node representations they learn are permutation-equivariant, meaning they are able to maintain order regardless of how the nodes are arranged. However, this property can also prevent GNNs from being proximity-aware, which is important for analyzing graphs. Some variants of GNNs have been developed to preserve node proximities, but they do not maintain permutation-equivariance. The challenge is to create a GNN that is both proximity-aware and permutation-equivariant. This paper proposes Stochastic Message Passing (SMP), a GNN that preserves both properties by using stochastic node representations that learn to preserve node proximities. The authors prove that this approach can maintain both properties under certain conditions, and their experiments show that SMP is effective for tasks like node classification and link prediction.",1
"Finding general evaluation metrics for unsupervised representation learning techniques is a challenging open research question, which recently has become more and more necessary due to the increasing interest in unsupervised methods. Even though these methods promise beneficial representation characteristics, most approaches currently suffer from the objective function mismatch. This mismatch states that the performance on a desired target task can decrease when the unsupervised pretext task is learned too long - especially when both tasks are ill-posed. In this work, we build upon the widely used linear evaluation protocol and define new general evaluation metrics to quantitatively capture the objective function mismatch and the more generic metrics mismatch. We discuss the usability and stability of our protocols on a variety of pretext and target tasks and study mismatches in a wide range of experiments. Thereby we disclose dependencies of the objective function mismatch across several pretext and target tasks with respect to the pretext model's representation size, target model complexity, pretext and target augmentations as well as pretext and target task types.",0
"It is a difficult challenge to find universal metrics for assessing unsupervised representation learning methods, which has become increasingly urgent as the demand for such methods grows. Despite the potential benefits of these techniques, many current approaches suffer from a mismatch between the objective of the unsupervised pretext task and the desired target task. If the pretext task is learned for too long, particularly when both tasks are ill-defined, performance on the target task may suffer. In this study, we expand upon the widely-used linear evaluation protocol and develop new metrics to quantitatively measure both the objective function mismatch and the more general metrics mismatch. We test the usability and stability of our protocols across a variety of pretext and target tasks, and examine mismatches in a range of experiments. Our results reveal the dependence of the objective function mismatch on several factors, including the representation size of the pretext model, the complexity of the target model, and the types of augmentations used for both pretext and target tasks.",1
"In this paper, we introduce the MLM (Multiple Languages and Modalities) dataset - a new resource to train and evaluate multitask systems on samples in multiple modalities and three languages. The generation process and inclusion of semantic data provide a resource that further tests the ability for multitask systems to learn relationships between entities. The dataset is designed for researchers and developers who build applications that perform multiple tasks on data encountered on the web and in digital archives. A second version of MLM provides a geo-representative subset of the data with weighted samples for countries of the European Union. We demonstrate the value of the resource in developing novel applications in the digital humanities with a motivating use case and specify a benchmark set of tasks to retrieve modalities and locate entities in the dataset.

"Graphs or networks are a very convenient way to represent data with lots of interaction. Recently, Machine Learning on Graph data has gained a lot of traction. In particular, vertex classification and missing edge detection have very interesting applications, ranging from drug discovery to recommender systems. To achieve such tasks, tremendous work has been accomplished to learn embedding of nodes and edges into finite-dimension vector spaces. This task is called Graph Representation Learning. However, Graph Representation Learning techniques often display prohibitive time and memory complexities, preventing their use in real-time with business size graphs. In this paper, we address this issue by leveraging a degeneracy property of Graphs - the K-Core Decomposition. We present two techniques taking advantage of this decomposition to reduce the time and memory consumption of walk-based Graph Representation Learning algorithms. We evaluate the performances, expressed in terms of quality of embedding and computational resources, of the proposed techniques on several academic datasets.

"This paper addresses the problem of self-supervised video representation learning from a new perspective -- by video pace prediction. It stems from the observation that human visual system is sensitive to video pace, e.g., slow motion, a widely used technique in film making. Specifically, given a video played in natural pace, we randomly sample training clips in different paces and ask a neural network to identify the pace for each video clip. The assumption here is that the network can only succeed in such a pace reasoning task when it understands the underlying video content and learns representative spatio-temporal features. In addition, we further introduce contrastive learning to push the model towards discriminating different paces by maximizing the agreement on similar video content. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on action recognition and video retrieval tasks with several alternative network architectures. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for self-supervised video representation learning across different network architectures and different benchmarks.

"In discrete choice modeling (DCM), model misspecifications may lead to limited predictability and biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we propose a new approach for estimating choice models in which we divide the systematic part of the utility specification into (i) a knowledge-driven part, and (ii) a data-driven one, which learns a new representation from available explanatory variables. Our formulation increases the predictive power of standard DCM without sacrificing their interpretability. We show the effectiveness of our formulation by augmenting the utility specification of the Multinomial Logit (MNL) and the Nested Logit (NL) models with a new non-linear representation arising from a Neural Network (NN), leading to new choice models referred to as the Learning Multinomial Logit (L-MNL) and Learning Nested Logit (L-NL) models.

"Representation learning on networks offers a powerful alternative to the oft painstaking process of manual feature engineering, and as a result, has enjoyed considerable success in recent years. However, all the existing representation learning methods are based on the first-order network (FON), that is, the network that only captures the pairwise interactions between the nodes. As a result, these methods may fail to incorporate non-Markovian higher-order dependencies in the network. Thus, the embeddings that are generated may not accurately represent of the underlying phenomena in a network, resulting in inferior performance in different inductive or transductive learning tasks. To address this challenge, this paper presents HONEM, a higher-order network embedding method that captures the non-Markovian higher-order dependencies in a network. HONEM is specifically designed for the higher-order network structure (HON) and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in node classification, network re-construction, link prediction, and visualization for networks that contain non-Markovian higher-order dependencies.",0

"Unsupervised graph representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional node embeddings without supervision while preserving graph topological structures and node attributive features. Previous graph neural networks (GNN) require a large number of labeled nodes, which may not be accessible in real-world graph data. In this paper, we present a novel cluster-aware graph neural network (CAGNN) model for unsupervised graph representation learning using self-supervised techniques. In CAGNN, we perform clustering on the node embeddings and update the model parameters by predicting the cluster assignments. Moreover, we observe that graphs often contain inter-class edges, which mislead the GNN model to aggregate noisy information from neighborhood nodes. We further refine the graph topology by strengthening intra-class edges and reducing node connections between different classes based on cluster labels, which better preserves cluster structures in the embedding space. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark tasks using real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model over existing baseline methods.

"Due to the hierarchical structure of many machine learning problems, bilevel programming is becoming more and more important recently, however, the complicated correlation between the inner and outer problem makes it extremely challenging to solve. Although several intuitive algorithms based on the automatic differentiation have been proposed and obtained success in some applications, not much attention has been paid to finding the optimal formulation of the bilevel model. Whether there exists a better formulation is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose an improved bilevel model which converges faster and better compared to the current formulation.

"Representation learning over graph structure data has been widely studied due to its wide application prospects. However, previous methods mainly focus on static graphs while many real-world graphs evolve over time. Modeling such evolution is important for predicting properties of unseen networks. To resolve this challenge, we propose SGRNN, a novel neural architecture that applies stochastic latent variables to simultaneously capture the evolution in node attributes and topology. Specifically, deterministic states are separated from stochastic states in the iterative process to suppress mutual interference. With semi-implicit variational inference integrated to SGRNN, a non-Gaussian variational distribution is proposed to help further improve the performance. In addition, to alleviate KL-vanishing problem in SGRNN, a simple and interpretable structure is proposed based on the lower bound of KL-divergence.

"Learning group representation is a commonly concerned issue in tasks where the basic unit is a group, set, or sequence. Previously, the research community tries to tackle it by aggregating the elements in a group based on an indicator either defined by humans such as the quality and saliency, or generated by a black box such as the attention score. This article provides a more essential and explicable view. We claim the most significant indicator to show whether the group representation can be benefited from one of its element is not the quality or an inexplicable score, but the discriminability w.r.t. the model. We explicitly design the discrimiability using embedded class centroids on a proxy set. We show the discrimiability knowledge has good properties that can be distilled by a light-weight distillation network and can be generalized on the unseen target set. The whole procedure is denoted as discriminability distillation learning (DDL). The proposed DDL can be flexibly plugged into many group-based recognition tasks without influencing the original training procedures.

"Person re-identification (re-id) aims to match the same person from images taken across multiple cameras. Most existing person re-id methods generally require a large amount of identity labeled data to act as discriminative guideline for representation learning. Difficulty in manually collecting identity labeled data leads to poor adaptability in practical scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose an unsupervised center-based clustering approach capable of progressively learning and exploiting the underlying re-id discriminative information from temporal continuity within a camera. We call our framework Temporal Continuity based Unsupervised Learning (TCUL). Specifically, TCUL simultaneously does center based clustering of unlabeled (target) dataset and fine-tunes a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on irrelevant labeled (source) dataset to enhance discriminative capability of the CNN for the target dataset. Furthermore, it exploits temporally continuous nature of images within-camera jointly with spatial similarity of feature maps across-cameras to generate reliable pseudo-labels for training a re-identification model. As the training progresses, number of reliable samples keep on growing adaptively which in turn boosts representation ability of the CNN. Extensive experiments on three large-scale person re-id benchmark datasets are conducted to compare our framework with state-of-the-art techniques, which demonstrate superiority of TCUL over existing methods.",0

Graph embedding has been proved extremely useful to learn low-dimensional feature representations from graph structured data.

"Visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) require an interplay of visual perception with reasoning about the question semantics grounded in perception. However, recent advances in this area are still primarily driven by perception improvements (e.g. scene graph generation) rather than reasoning. Neuro-symbolic models such as Neural Module Networks bring the benefits of compositional reasoning to VQA, but they are still entangled with visual representation learning, and thus neural reasoning is hard to improve and assess on its own. To address this, we propose (1) a framework to isolate and evaluate the reasoning aspect of VQA separately from its perception, and (2) a novel top-down calibration technique that allows the model to answer reasoning questions even with imperfect perception. To this end, we introduce a differentiable first-order logic formalism for VQA that explicitly decouples question answering from visual perception.

"Interpreting high-dimensional latent representations learned by neural network classifiers is challenging, particularly in medical applications where developers and experts seek to understand their connection to classification performance. To address this issue, we introduce Projective Latent Interventions (PLIs), a method for retraining classifiers by modifying low-dimensional embeddings of the latent space via back-propagation. PLIs rely on parametric approximations of t-distributed stochastic neighbourhood embeddings and enable domain experts to intuitively control the latent decision space to better align with their expectations. For instance, enhancing performance for specific class pairs is achievable by manually separating the class clusters in the embedding. We assess PLIs in a fetal ultrasound imaging setting.",1
"Federated learning allows many parties to collaboratively build a model without exposing data. Particularly, vertical federated learning (VFL) enables parties to build a robust shared machine learning model based upon distributed features about the same samples. However, VFL requires all parties to share a sufficient amount of overlapping samples. In reality, the set of overlapping samples may be small, leaving the majority of the non-overlapping data unutilized. In this paper, we propose Federated Multi-View Training (FedMVT), a semi-supervised learning approach that improves the performance of VFL with limited overlapping samples. FedMVT estimates representations for missing features and predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples to expand training set, and trains three classifiers jointly based upon different views of the input to improve model's representation learning. FedMVT does not require parties to share their original data and model parameters, thus preserving data privacy. We conduct experiments on the NUS-WIDE and the CIFAR10. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMVT significantly outperforms vanilla VFL that only utilizes overlapping samples, and improves the performance of the local model in the party that owns labels.",0

"With recent developments in smart technologies, there has been a growing focus on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for affective computing to further enhance the user experience through emotion recognition. Typically, machine learning models used for affective computing are trained using manually extracted features from biological signals. Such features may not generalize well for large datasets and may be sub-optimal in capturing the information from the raw input data. One approach to address this issue is to use fully supervised deep learning methods to learn latent representations of the biosignals. However, this method requires human supervision to label the data, which may be unavailable or difficult to obtain. In this work we propose an unsupervised framework reduce the reliance on human supervision. The proposed framework utilizes two stacked convolutional autoencoders to learn latent representations from wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals. These representations are utilized within a random forest model for binary arousal classification. This approach reduces human supervision and enables the aggregation of datasets allowing for higher generalizability. To validate this framework, an aggregated dataset comprised of the AMIGOS, ASCERTAIN, CLEAS, and MAHNOB-HCI datasets is created. The results of our proposed method are compared with using convolutional neural networks, as well as methods that employ manual extraction of hand-crafted features. The methodology used for fusing the two modalities is also investigated. Lastly, we show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art results that have performed arousal detection on the same datasets using ECG and EDA biosignals. The results show the wide-spread applicability for stacked convolutional autoencoders to be used with machine learning for affective computing.",0

"A major endeavor of computer vision is to represent, understand and extract structure from 3D data. Towards this goal, unsupervised learning is a powerful and necessary tool. Most current unsupervised methods for 3D shape analysis use datasets that are aligned, require objects to be reconstructed and suffer from deteriorated performance on downstream tasks. To solve these issues, we propose to extend the InfoMax and contrastive learning principles on 3D shapes.

"We propose and demonstrate a novel machine learning algorithm that assesses pulmonary edema severity from chest radiographs. While large publicly available datasets of chest radiographs and free-text radiology reports exist, only limited numerical edema severity labels can be extracted from radiology reports.

To take advantage of the rich information present in the radiology reports, we develop a neural network model that is trained on both images and free-text to assess pulmonary edema severity from chest radiographs at inference time. Our experimental results suggest that the joint image-text representation learning improves the performance of pulmonary edema assessment compared to a supervised model trained on images only.

"Learning about many things can provide numerous benefits to a reinforcement learning system. For example, learning many auxiliary value functions, in addition to optimizing the environmental reward, appears to improve both exploration and representation learning. The question we tackle in this paper is how to sculpt the stream of experience---how to adapt the learning system's behavior---to optimize the learning of a collection of value functions. A simple answer is to compute an intrinsic reward based on the statistics of each auxiliary learner, and use reinforcement learning to maximize that intrinsic reward. Unfortunately, implementing this simple idea has proven difficult, and thus has been the focus of decades of study. It remains unclear which of the many possible measures of learning would work well in a parallel learning setting where environmental reward is extremely sparse or absent. In this paper, we investigate and compare different intrinsic reward mechanisms in a new bandit-like parallel-learning testbed. We discuss the interaction between reward and prediction learners and highlight the importance of introspective prediction learners: those that increase their rate of learning when progress is possible, and decrease when it is not. We provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of 14 different rewards, including well-known ideas from reinforcement learning and active learning. Our results highlight a simple but seemingly powerful principle: intrinsic rewards based on the amount of learning can generate useful behavior, if each individual learner is introspective.",0

"In recent years, deep learning-based feature representation methods have shown a promising impact in electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Nonetheless, owing to high intra- and inter-subject variabilities, many studies on decoding EEG were designed in a subject-specific manner by using calibration samples, with no concern of its practical use, hampered by time-consuming steps and a large data requirement. To this end, recent studies adopted a transfer learning strategy, especially domain adaptation techniques. Among those, to our knowledge, an adversarial learning has shown its potential in BCIs. In the meantime, it is known that adversarial learning-based domain adaptation methods are prone to negative transfer that disrupts learning generalized feature representations, applicable to diverse domains, e.g., subjects or sessions in BCIs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns class-relevant and subject-invariant feature representations in an information-theoretic manner, without using adversarial learning. To be specific, we devise two operational components in a deep network that explicitly estimate mutual information between feature representations; (1) to decompose features in an intermediate layer into class-relevant and class-irrelevant ones, (2) to enrich class-discriminative feature representation. On two large EEG datasets, we validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework by comparing with several comparative methods in performance. Further, we conducted rigorous analyses by performing an ablation study in regard to the components in our network, explaining our model's decision on input EEG signals via layer-wise relevance propagation, and visualizing the distribution of learned features via t-SNE.",0

"Recommender systems play a fundamental role in web applications in filtering massive information and matching user interests. While many efforts have been devoted to developing more effective models in various scenarios, the exploration on the explainability of recommender systems is running behind. Explanations could help improve user experience and discover system defects. In this paper, after formally introducing the elements that are related to model explainability, we propose a novel explainable recommendation model through improving the transparency of the representation learning process. Specifically, to overcome the representation entangling problem in traditional models, we revise traditional graph convolution to discriminate information from different layers. Also, each representation vector is factorized into several segments, where each segment relates to one semantic aspect in data. Different from previous work, in our model, factor discovery and representation learning are simultaneously conducted, and we are able to handle extra attribute information and knowledge. In this way, the proposed model can learn interpretable and meaningful representations for users and items. Unlike traditional methods that need to make a trade-off between explainability and effectiveness, the performance of our proposed explainable model is not negatively affected after considering explainability. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of our model as well as explanation faithfulness.",0

"Deep clustering against self-supervised learning is a very important and promising direction for unsupervised visual representation learning since it requires little domain knowledge to design pretext tasks. However, the key component, embedding clustering, limits its extension to the extremely large-scale dataset due to its prerequisite to save the global latent embedding of the entire dataset. In this work, we aim to make this framework more simple and elegant without performance decline. We propose an unsupervised image classification framework without using embedding clustering, which is very similar to standard supervised training manner. For detailed interpretation, we further analyze its relation with deep clustering and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on ImageNet dataset have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, the experiments on transfer learning benchmarks have verified its generalization to other downstream tasks, including multi-label image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and few-shot image classification.",0

"Graph representation learning is gaining popularity in a wide range of applications, such as social networks analysis, computational biology, and recommender systems. However, different with positive results from many academic studies, applying graph neural networks (GNNs) in a real-world application is still challenging due to non-stationary environments. The underlying distribution of streaming data changes unexpectedly, resulting in different graph structures (a.k.a., concept drift). Therefore, it is essential to devise a robust graph learning technique so that the model does not overfit to the training graphs. In this work, we present Hop Sampling, a straightforward regularization method that can effectively prevent GNNs from overfishing. The hop sampling randomly selects the number of propagation steps rather than fixing it, and by doing so, it encourages the model to learn meaningful node representation for all intermediate propagation layers and to experience a variety of plausible graphs that are not in the training set. Particularly, we describe the use case of our method in recommender systems, a representative example of the real-world non-stationary case. We evaluated hop sampling on a large-scale real-world LINE dataset and conducted an online A/B/n test in LINE Coupon recommender systems of LINE Wallet Tab. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the prediction accuracy of GNNs. We observed hop sampling provides 7.97% and 16.93% improvements for NDCG and MAP compared to non-regularized GNN models in our online service. Furthermore, models using hop sampling alleviate the oversmoothing issue in GNNs enabling a deeper model as well as more diversified representation.",0

"This paper presents the novel Riemannian Fusion Network (RFNet), a deep neural architecture for learning spatial and temporal information from Electroencephalogram (EEG) for a number of different EEG-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) tasks and applications. The spatial information relies on Spatial Covariance Matrices (SCM) of multi-channel EEG, whose space form a Riemannian Manifold due to the Symmetric and Positive Definite structure. We exploit a Riemannian approach to map spatial information onto feature vectors in Euclidean space. The temporal information characterized by features based on differential entropy and logarithm power spectrum density is extracted from different windows through time. Our network then learns the temporal information by employing a deep long short-term memory network with a soft attention mechanism. The output of the attention mechanism is used as the temporal feature vector. To effectively fuse spatial and temporal information, we use an effective fusion strategy, which learns attention weights applied to embedding-specific features for decision making. We evaluate our proposed framework on four public datasets from three popular fields of BCI, notably emotion recognition, vigilance estimation, and motor imagery classification, containing various types of tasks such as binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression.

"Knowledge Distillation (KD) based methods adopt the one-way Knowledge Transfer (KT) scheme in which training a lower-capacity student network is guided by a pre-trained high-capacity teacher network.

In this paper, we propose Dense Cross-layer Mutual-distillation (DCM), an improved two-way KT method in which the teacher and student networks are trained collaboratively from scratch. To augment knowledge representation learning, well-designed auxiliary classifiers are added to certain hidden layers of both teacher and student networks. To boost KT performance, we introduce dense bidirectional KD operations between the layers appended with classifiers.

"With the rise of deep learning methods, person Re-Identification (ReID) performance has been improved tremendously in many public datasets. However, most public ReID datasets are collected in a short time window in which persons' appearance rarely changes. In real-world applications such as in a shopping mall, the same person's clothing may change, and different persons may wearing similar clothes. All these cases can result in an inconsistent ReID performance, revealing a critical problem that current ReID models heavily rely on person's apparels. Therefore, it is critical to learn an apparel-invariant person representation under cases like cloth changing or several persons wearing similar clothes. In this work, we tackle this problem from the viewpoint of invariant feature representation learning. The main contributions of this work are as follows. (1) We propose the semi-supervised Apparel-invariant Feature Learning (AIFL) framework to learn an apparel-invariant pedestrian representation using images of the same person wearing different clothes. (2) To obtain images of the same person wearing different clothes, we propose an unsupervised apparel-simulation GAN (AS-GAN) to synthesize cloth changing images according to the target cloth embedding. It's worth noting that the images used in ReID tasks were cropped from real-world low-quality CCTV videos, making it more challenging to synthesize cloth changing images. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets comparing with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal can improve the ReID performance of the baseline models.",0

"In medical imaging, manual annotations can be expensive to acquire and sometimes infeasible to access, making conventional deep learning-based models difficult to scale. As a result, it would be beneficial if useful representations could be derived from raw data without the need for manual annotations. In this paper, we propose to address the problem of self-supervised representation learning with multi-modal ultrasound video-speech raw data. For this case, we assume that there is a high correlation between the ultrasound video and the corresponding narrative speech audio of the sonographer. In order to learn meaningful representations, the model needs to identify such correlation and at the same time understand the underlying anatomical features. We designed a framework to model the correspondence between video and audio without any kind of human annotations. Within this framework, we introduce cross-modal contrastive learning and an affinity-aware self-paced learning scheme to enhance correlation modelling. Experimental evaluations on multi-modal fetal ultrasound video and audio show that the proposed approach is able to learn strong representations and transfers well to downstream tasks of standard plane detection and eye-gaze prediction.",0

"We introduce a new measure to evaluate the transferability of representations learned by classifiers. Our measure, the Log Expected Empirical Prediction (LEEP), is simple and easy to compute: when given a classifier trained on a source data set, it only requires running the target data set through this classifier once. We analyze the properties of LEEP theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. Our analysis shows that LEEP can predict the performance and convergence speed of both transfer and meta-transfer learning methods, even for small or imbalanced data. Moreover, LEEP outperforms recently proposed transferability measures such as negative conditional entropy and H scores. Notably, when transferring from ImageNet to CIFAR100, LEEP can achieve up to 30% improvement compared to the best competing method in terms of the correlations with actual transfer accuracy.",0

"Deep generative models have made tremendous advances in image and signal representation learning and generation. These models employ the full Euclidean space or a bounded subset as the latent space, whose flat geometry, however, is often too simplistic to meaningfully reflect the manifold structure of the data. In this work, we advocate the use of a multi-chart latent space for better data representation. Inspired by differential geometry, we propose a \textbf{Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE)} and prove a universal approximation theorem on its representation capability. We show that the training data size and the network size scale exponentially in approximation error with an exponent depending on the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold. CAE admits desirable manifold properties that auto-encoders with a flat latent space fail to obey, predominantly proximity of data. We conduct extensive experimentation with synthetic and real-life examples to demonstrate that CAE provides reconstruction with high fidelity, preserves proximity in the latent space, and generates new data remaining near the manifold. These experiments show that CAE is advantageous over existing auto-encoders and variants by preserving the topology of the data manifold as well as its geometry.",0

"In this paper, we propose an easily trained yet powerful representation learning approach with performance highly competitive to deep neural networks in a digital pathology image segmentation task. The method, called sparse coding driven deep decision tree ensembles that we abbreviate as ScD2TE, provides a new perspective on representation learning. We explore the possibility of stacking several layers based on non-differentiable pairwise modules and generate a densely concatenated architecture holding the characteristics of feature map reuse and end-to-end dense learning. Under this architecture, fast convolutional sparse coding is used to extract multi-level features from the output of each layer. In this way, rich image appearance models together with more contextual information are integrated by learning a series of decision tree ensembles. The appearance and the high-level context features of all the previous layers are seamlessly combined by concatenating them to feed-forward as input, which in turn makes the outputs of subsequent layers more accurate and the whole model efficient to train. Compared with deep neural networks, our proposed ScD2TE does not require back-propagation computation and depends on less hyper-parameters. ScD2TE is able to achieve a fast end-to-end pixel-wise training in a layer-wise manner. We demonstrated the superiority of our segmentation technique by evaluating it on the multi-disease state and multi-organ dataset where consistently higher performances were obtained for comparison against several state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), fully convolutional networks (FCN), etc.",0

"We propose a self-supervised method to learn feature representations from videos. A standard approach in traditional self-supervised methods uses positive-negative data pairs to train with contrastive learning strategy. In such a case, different modalities of the same video are treated as positives and video clips from a different video are treated as negatives. Because the spatio-temporal information is important for video representation, we extend the negative samples by introducing intra-negative samples, which are transformed from the same anchor video by breaking temporal relations in video clips. With the proposed Inter-Intra Contrastive (IIC) framework, we can train spatio-temporal convolutional networks to learn video representations. There are many flexible options in our IIC framework and we conduct experiments by using several different configurations. Evaluations are conducted on video retrieval and video recognition tasks using the learned video representation. Our proposed IIC outperforms current state-of-the-art results by a large margin, such as 16.7% and 9.5% points improvements in top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for video retrieval, respectively.

"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to rely more on local texture rather than global shape when making decisions. Recent work also indicates a close relationship between CNN's texture-bias and its robustness against distribution shift, adversarial perturbation, random corruption, etc. In this work, we attempt at improving various kinds of robustness universally by alleviating CNN's texture bias. With inspiration from the human visual system, we propose a light-weight model-agnostic method, namely Informative Dropout (InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce texture bias. Specifically, we discriminate texture from shape based on local self-information in an image, and adopt a Dropout-like algorithm to decorrelate the model output from the local texture. Through extensive experiments, we observe enhanced robustness under various scenarios (domain generalization, few-shot classification, image corruption, and adversarial perturbation).

"Deep neural networks often degrade significantly when training data suffer from class imbalance problems. Existing approaches, e.g., re-sampling and re-weighting, commonly address this issue by rearranging the label distribution of training data to train the networks fitting well to the implicit balanced label distribution. However, most of them hinder the representative ability of learned features due to insufficient use of intra/inter-sample information of training data. To address this issue, we propose meta feature modulator (MFM), a meta-learning framework to model the difference between the long-tailed training data and the balanced meta data from the perspective of representation learning. Concretely, we employ learnable hyper-parameters (dubbed modulation parameters) to adaptively scale and shift the intermediate features of classification networks, and the modulation parameters are optimized together with the classification network parameters guided by a small amount of balanced meta data. We further design a modulator network to guide the generation of the modulation parameters, and such a meta-learner can be readily adapted to train the classification network on other long-tailed datasets. Extensive experiments on benchmark vision datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach on long-tailed recognition tasks beyond other state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Temporal cues in videos provide important information for recognizing actions accurately. However, temporal-discriminative features can hardly be extracted without using an annotated large-scale video action dataset for training. This paper proposes a novel Video-based Temporal-Discriminative Learning (VTDL) framework in self-supervised manner. Without labelled data for network pretraining, temporal triplet is generated for each anchor video by using segment of the same or different time interval so as to enhance the capacity for temporal feature representation. Measuring temporal information by time derivative, Temporal Consistent Augmentation (TCA) is designed to ensure that the time derivative (in any order) of the augmented positive is invariant except for a scaling constant. Finally, temporal-discriminative features are learnt by minimizing the distance between each anchor and its augmented positive, while the distance between each anchor and its augmented negative as well as other videos saved in the memory bank is maximized to enrich the representation diversity. In the downstream action recognition task, the proposed method significantly outperforms existing related works. Surprisingly, the proposed self-supervised approach is better than fully-supervised methods on UCF101 and HMDB51 when a small-scale video dataset (with only thousands of videos) is used for pre-training.

"Pretraining general-purpose visual features has become a crucial part of tackling many computer vision tasks. While one can learn such features on the extensively-annotated ImageNet dataset, recent approaches have looked at ways to allow for noisy, fewer, or even no annotations to perform such pretraining.

To do so, motivated by the recent progresses in language models, we introduce {\em image-conditioned masked language modeling} (ICMLM) -- a proxy task to learn visual representations over image-caption pairs. ICMLM consists in predicting masked words in captions by relying on visual cues. To tackle this task, we propose hybrid models, with dedicated visual and textual encoders, and we show that the visual representations learned as a by-product of solving this task transfer well to a variety of target tasks.

"In this paper, we present a new algorithm for semi-supervised representation learning. In this algorithm, we first find a vector representation for the labels of the data points based on their local positions in the space. Then, we map the data to lower-dimensional space using a linear transformation such that the dependency between the transformed data and the assigned labels is maximized. In fact, we try to find a mapping that is as discriminative as possible. The approach will use Hilber-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as the dependence measure. We also present a kernelized version of the algorithm, which allows non-linear transformations and provides more flexibility in finding the appropriate mapping. Use of unlabeled data for learning new representation is not always beneficial and there is no algorithm that can deterministically guarantee the improvement of the performance by exploiting unlabeled data.

"We introduce BSD-GAN, a novel multi-branch and scale-disentangled training method which enables unconditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn image representations at multiple scales, benefiting a wide range of generation and editing tasks. The key feature of BSD-GAN is that it is trained in multiple branches, progressively covering both the breadth and depth of the network, as resolutions of the training images increase to reveal finer-scale features. Specifically, each noise vector, as input to the generator network of BSD-GAN, is deliberately split into several sub-vectors, each corresponding to, and is trained to learn, image representations at a particular scale. During training, we progressively ""de-freeze"" the sub-vectors, one at a time, as a new set of higher-resolution images is employed for training and more network layers are added. A consequence of such an explicit sub-vector designation is that we can directly manipulate and even combine latent (sub-vector) codes which model different feature scales.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method in scale-disentangled learning of image representations and synthesis of novel image contents, without any extra labels and without compromising quality of the synthesized high-resolution images.

"Graph representation learning aims to encode all nodes of a graph into low-dimensional vectors that will serve as input of many compute vision tasks. However, most existing algorithms ignore the existence of inherent data distribution and even noises. This may significantly increase the phenomenon of over-fitting and deteriorate the testing accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Distribution-induced Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (named DBGAN) for graph representation learning. Instead of the widely used normal distribution assumption, the prior distribution of latent representation in our DBGAN is estimated in a structure-aware way, which implicitly bridges the graph and feature spaces by prototype learning. Thus discriminative and robust representations are generated for all nodes. Furthermore, to improve their generalization ability while preserving representation ability, the sample-level and distribution-level consistency is well balanced via a bidirectional adversarial learning framework. An extensive group of experiments are then carefully designed and presented, demonstrating that our DBGAN obtains remarkably more favorable trade-off between representation and robustness, and meanwhile is dimension-efficient, over currently available alternatives in various tasks.",0

This dataset is large enough to train deep networks for disentanglement learning, and benchmarking experiments using popular unsupervised disentanglement algorithms are presented and compared with results obtained from an image-based dataset.",1
"Self-supervised representation learning approaches have recently surpassed their supervised learning counterparts on downstream tasks like object detection and image classification. Somewhat mysteriously the recent gains in performance come from training instance classification models, treating each image and it's augmented versions as samples of a single class. In this work, we first present quantitative experiments to demystify these gains. We demonstrate that approaches like MOCO and PIRL learn occlusion-invariant representations. However, they fail to capture viewpoint and category instance invariance which are crucial components for object recognition. Second, we demonstrate that these approaches obtain further gains from access to a clean object-centric training dataset like Imagenet. Finally, we propose an approach to leverage unstructured videos to learn representations that possess higher viewpoint invariance. Our results show that the learned representations outperform MOCOv2 trained on the same data in terms of invariances encoded and the performance on downstream image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.",0

"Graph representation learning based on graph neural networks (GNNs) can greatly improve the performance of downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, the general GNN models do not aggregate node information in a hierarchical manner, and can miss key higher-order structural features of many graphs. The hierarchical aggregation also enables the graph representations to be explainable. In addition, supervised graph representation learning requires labeled data, which is expensive and error-prone. To address these issues, we present an unsupervised graph representation learning method, Unsupervised Hierarchical Graph Representation (UHGR), which can generate hierarchical representations of graphs. Our method focuses on maximizing mutual information between ""local"" and high-level ""global"" representations, which enables us to learn the node embeddings and graph embeddings without any labeled data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform the node and graph classification using the learned node and graph embeddings. The results show that the proposed method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art supervised methods on several benchmarks. In addition, our visualization of hierarchical representations indicates that our method can capture meaningful and interpretable clusters.",0
"The use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for graph representation learning has been shown to enhance downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification.

"Self-supervised learning has made unsupervised pretraining relevant again for difficult computer vision tasks. The most effective self-supervised methods involve prediction tasks based on features extracted from diverse views of the data. DeepInfoMax (DIM) is a self-supervised method which leverages the internal structure of deep networks to construct such views, forming prediction tasks between local features which depend on small patches in an image and global features which depend on the whole image. In this paper, we extend DIM to the video domain by leveraging similar structure in spatio-temporal networks, producing a method we call Video Deep InfoMax(VDIM). We find that drawing views from both natural-rate sequences and temporally-downsampled sequences yields results on Kinetics-pretrained action recognition tasks which match or outperform prior state-of-the-art methods that use more costly large-time-scale transformer models. We also examine the effects of data augmentation and fine-tuning methods, accomplishingSoTA by a large margin when training only on the UCF-101 dataset.",0

"Human perception is structured around objects which form the basis for our higher-level cognition and impressive systematic generalization abilities. Yet most work on representation learning focuses on feature learning without even considering multiple objects, or treats segmentation as an (often supervised) preprocessing step. Instead, we argue for the importance of learning to segment and represent objects jointly. We demonstrate that, starting from the simple assumption that a scene is composed of multiple entities, it is possible to learn to segment images into interpretable objects with disentangled representations. Our method learns -- without supervision -- to inpaint occluded parts, and extrapolates to scenes with more objects and to unseen objects with novel feature combinations. We also show that, due to the use of iterative variational inference, our system is able to learn multi-modal posteriors for ambiguous inputs and extends naturally to sequences.",0

By starting with the assumption that a scene consists of multiple entities, we can learn how to segment images into objects with comprehensible representations. Our method does not require supervision and can also learn to fill in obscured parts, extrapolate to scenes with more objects, and identify novel feature combinations in unseen objects. Furthermore, our system uses iterative variational inference to learn multi-modal posteriors for ambiguous inputs and can be extended to sequences.",1
"Noisy labels are an unavoidable consequence of labeling processes and detecting them is an important step towards preventing performance degradations in Convolutional Neural Networks. Discarding noisy labels avoids a harmful memorization, while the associated image content can still be exploited in a semi-supervised learning (SSL) setup. Clean samples are usually identified using the small loss trick, i.e. they exhibit a low loss. However, we show that different noise distributions make the application of this trick less straightforward and propose to continuously relabel all images to reveal a discriminative loss against multiple distributions. SSL is then applied twice, once to improve the clean-noisy detection and again for training the final model. We design an experimental setup based on ImageNet32/64 for better understanding the consequences of representation learning with differing label noise distributions and find that non-uniform out-of-distribution noise better resembles real-world noise and that in most cases intermediate features are not affected by label noise corruption. Experiments in CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet32/64 and WebVision (real-world noise) demonstrate that the proposed label noise Distribution Robust Pseudo-Labeling (DRPL) approach gives substantial improvements over recent state-of-the-art.

"Several multi-modality representation learning approaches such as LXMERT and ViLBERT have been proposed recently. Such approaches can achieve superior performance due to the high-level semantic information captured during large-scale multimodal pretraining. However, as ViLBERT and LXMERT adopt visual region regression and classification loss, they often suffer from domain gap and noisy label problems, based on the visual features having been pretrained on the Visual Genome dataset. To overcome these issues, we propose unbiased Contrastive Visual-Linguistic Pretraining (CVLP), which constructs a visual self-supervised loss built upon contrastive learning. We evaluate CVLP on several down-stream tasks, including VQA, GQA and NLVR2 to validate the superiority of contrastive learning on multi-modality representation learning.

"Smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices produce a wealth of data that cannot be accumulated in a centralized repository for learning supervised models due to privacy, bandwidth limitations, and the prohibitive cost of annotations. Federated learning provides a compelling framework for learning models from decentralized data, but conventionally, it assumes the availability of labeled samples, whereas on-device data are generally either unlabeled or cannot be annotated readily through user interaction. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised approach termed \textit{scalogram-signal correspondence learning} based on wavelet transform to learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs, such as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel state information. Our auxiliary task requires a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary viewpoint (i.e., a scalogram generated with a wavelet transform) align with each other or not through optimizing a contrastive objective. We extensively assess the quality of learned features with our multi-view strategy on diverse public datasets, achieving strong performance in all domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of representations learned from an unlabeled input collection on downstream tasks with training a linear classifier over pretrained network, usefulness in low-data regime, transfer learning, and cross-validation. Our methodology achieves competitive performance with fully-supervised networks, and it outperforms pre-training with autoencoders in both central and federated contexts.

"Invariance (defined in a general sense) has been one of the most effective priors for representation learning.

"Protein function prediction may be framed as predicting subgraphs (with certain closure properties) of a directed acyclic graph describing the hierarchy of protein functions. Graph neural networks (GNNs), with their built-in inductive bias for relational data, are hence naturally suited for this task. However, in contrast with most GNN applications, the graph is not related to the input, but to the label space. Accordingly, we propose Tail-GNNs, neural networks which naturally compose with the output space of any neural network for multi-task prediction, to provide relationally-reinforced labels. For protein function prediction, we combine a Tail-GNN with a dilated convolutional network which learns representations of the protein sequence, making significant improvement in F_1 score and demonstrating the ability of Tail-GNNs to learn useful representations of labels and exploit them in real-world problem solving.",0

"With promising results of machine learning based models in computer vision, applications on medical imaging data have been increasing exponentially. However, generalizations to complex real-world clinical data is a persistent problem. Deep learning models perform well when trained on standardized datasets from artificial settings, such as clinical trials. However, real-world data is different and translations are yielding varying results. The complexity of real-world applications in healthcare could emanate from a mixture of different data distributions across multiple device domains alongside the inevitable noise sourced from varying image resolutions, human errors, and the lack of manual gradings. In addition, healthcare applications not only suffer from the scarcity of labeled data, but also face limited access to unlabeled data due to HIPAA regulations, patient privacy, ambiguity in data ownership, and challenges in collecting data from different sources. These limitations pose additional challenges to applying deep learning algorithms in healthcare and clinical translations. In this paper, we utilize self-supervised representation learning methods, formulated effectively in transfer learning settings, to address limited data availability.

"Deep generative models seek to recover the process with which the observed data was generated. They may be used to synthesize new samples or to subsequently extract representations. Successful approaches in the domain of images are driven by several core inductive biases. However, a bias to account for the compositional way in which humans structure a visual scene in terms of objects has frequently been overlooked. In this work, we investigate object compositionality as an inductive bias for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We present a minimal modification of a standard generator to incorporate this inductive bias and find that it reliably learns to generate images as compositions of objects. Using this general design as a backbone, we then propose two useful extensions to incorporate dependencies among objects and background. We extensively evaluate our approach on several multi-object image datasets and highlight the merits of incorporating structure for representation learning purposes. In particular, we find that our structured GANs are better at generating multi-object images that are more faithful to the reference distribution. More so, we demonstrate how, by leveraging the structure of the learned generative process, one can `invert' the learned generative model to perform unsupervised instance segmentation. On the challenging CLEVR dataset, it is shown how our approach is able to improve over other recent purely unsupervised object-centric approaches to image generation.",0

"This paper studies semi-supervised object classification in relational data, which is a fundamental problem in relational data modeling. The problem has been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of object labels.

"Many learning tasks involve multi-modal data streams, where continuous data from different modes convey a comprehensive description about objects. A major challenge in this context is how to efficiently interpret multi-modal information in complex environments. This has motivated numerous studies on learning unsupervised representations from multi-modal data streams. These studies aim to understand higher-level contextual information (e.g., a Twitter message) by jointly learning embeddings for the lower-level semantic units in different modalities (e.g., text, user, and location of a Twitter message). However, these methods directly associate each low-level semantic unit with a continuous embedding vector, which results in high memory requirements. Hence, deploying and continuously learning such models in low-memory devices (e.g., mobile devices) becomes a problem. To address this problem, we present METEOR, a novel MEmory and Time Efficient Online Representation learning technique, which: (1) learns compact representations for multi-modal data by sharing parameters within semantically meaningful groups and preserves the domain-agnostic semantics; (2) can be accelerated using parallel processes to accommodate different stream rates while capturing the temporal changes of the units; and (3) can be easily extended to capture implicit/explicit external knowledge related to multi-modal data streams. We evaluate METEOR using two types of multi-modal data streams (i.e., social media streams and shopping transaction streams) to demonstrate its ability to adapt to different domains. Our results show that METEOR preserves the quality of the representations while reducing memory usage by around 80% compared to the conventional memory-intensive embeddings.",0

"Electronic medical record (EMR) data contains historical sequences of visits of patients, and each visit contains rich information, such as patient demographics, hospital utilisation and medical codes, including diagnosis, procedure and medication codes. Most existing EMR embedding methods capture visit-code associations by constructing input visit representations as binary vectors with a static vocabulary of medical codes. With this limited representation, they fail in encapsulating rich attribute information of visits (demographics and utilisation information) and/or codes (e.g., medical code descriptions). Furthermore, current work considers visits of the same patient as discrete-time events and ignores time gaps between them. However, the time gaps between visits depict dynamics of the patient's medical history inducing varying influences on future visits. To address these limitations, we present $\mathtt{MedGraph}$, a supervised EMR embedding method that captures two types of information: (1) the visit-code associations in an attributed bipartite graph, and (2) the temporal sequencing of visits through a point process. $\mathtt{MedGraph}$ produces Gaussian embeddings for visits and codes to model the uncertainty. We evaluate the performance of $\mathtt{MedGraph}$ through an extensive experimental study and show that $\mathtt{MedGraph}$ outperforms state-of-the-art EMR embedding methods in several medical risk prediction tasks.",0

"With the wide adoption of mobile devices, today's location tracking systems such as satellites, cellular base stations and wireless access points are continuously producing tremendous amounts of location data of moving objects. The ability to discover moving objects that travel together, i.e., traveling companions, from their trajectories is desired by many applications such as intelligent transportation systems and location-based services. Existing algorithms are either based on pattern mining methods that define a particular pattern of traveling companions or based on representation learning methods that learn similar representations for similar trajectories. The former methods suffer from the pairwise point-matching problem and the latter often ignore the temporal proximity between trajectories. In this work, we propose a generic deep representation learning model using autoencoders, namely, ATTN-MEAN, for the discovery of traveling companions. ATTN-MEAN collectively injects spatial and temporal information into its input embeddings using skip-gram, positional encoding techniques, respectively. Besides, our model further encourages trajectories to learn from their neighbours by leveraging the Sort-Tile-Recursive algorithm, mean operation and global attention mechanism. After obtaining the representations from the encoders, we run DBSCAN to cluster the representations to find travelling companion. The corresponding trajectories in the same cluster are considered as traveling companions. Experimental results suggest that ATTN-MEAN performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms on finding traveling companions.",0

"The advancement of visual tracking has continuously been brought by deep learning models. Typically, supervised learning is employed to train these models with expensive labeled data. In order to reduce the workload of manual annotations and learn to track arbitrary objects, we propose an unsupervised learning method for visual tracking. The motivation of our unsupervised learning is that a robust tracker should be effective in bidirectional tracking. Specifically, the tracker is able to forward localize a target object in successive frames and backtrace to its initial position in the first frame. Based on such a motivation, in the training process, we measure the consistency between forward and backward trajectories to learn a robust tracker from scratch merely using unlabeled videos. We build our framework on a Siamese correlation filter network, and propose a multi-frame validation scheme and a cost-sensitive loss to facilitate unsupervised learning. Without bells and whistles, the proposed unsupervised tracker achieves the baseline accuracy as classic fully supervised trackers while achieving a real-time speed. Furthermore, our unsupervised framework exhibits a potential in leveraging more unlabeled or weakly labeled data to further improve the tracking accuracy.",0

Previous methods have shown their efficiency in face parsing, which however overlook the correlation among different face regions. The correlation is a critical clue about the facial appearance, pose, expression etc., and should be taken into account for face parsing. To this end, we propose to model and reason the region-wise relations by learning graph representations, and leverage the edge information between regions for optimized abstraction. Specifically, we encode a facial image onto a global graph representation where a collection of pixels (""regions"") with similar features are projected to each vertex. Our model learns and reasons over relations between the regions by propagating information across vertices on the graph. Furthermore, we incorporate the edge information to aggregate the pixel-wise features onto vertices, which emphasizes on the features around edges for fine segmentation along edges. The finally learned graph representation is projected back to pixel grids for parsing. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the widely used Helen dataset, and also exhibits the superior performance on the large-scale CelebAMask-HQ and LaPa dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/tegusi/EAGRNet.",0

"This paper proposes a knowledge distillation method for foreground object search (FoS). Given a background and a rectangle specifying the foreground location and scale, FoS retrieves compatible foregrounds in a certain category for later image composition. Foregrounds within the same category can be grouped into a small number of patterns. Instances within each pattern are compatible with any query input interchangeably. These instances are referred to as interchangeable foregrounds. We first present a pipeline to build pattern-level FoS dataset containing labels of interchangeable foregrounds. We then establish a benchmark dataset for further training and testing following the pipeline. As for the proposed method, we first train a foreground encoder to learn representations of interchangeable foregrounds. We then train a query encoder to learn query-foreground compatibility following a knowledge distillation framework. It aims to transfer knowledge from interchangeable foregrounds to supervise representation learning of compatibility. The query feature representation is projected to the same latent space as interchangeable foregrounds, enabling very efficient and interpretable instance-level search. Furthermore, pattern-level search is feasible to retrieve more controllable, reasonable and diverse foregrounds. The proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 10.42% in absolute difference and 24.06% in relative improvement evaluated by mean average precision (mAP). Extensive experimental results also demonstrate its efficacy from various aspects. The benchmark dataset and code will be release shortly.",0

"Target-driven visual navigation aims at navigating an agent towards a given target based on the observation of the agent. In this task, it is critical to learn informative visual representation and robust navigation policy. Aiming to improve these two components, this paper proposes three complementary techniques, object relation graph (ORG), trial-driven imitation learning (IL), and a memory-augmented tentative policy network (TPN). ORG improves visual representation learning by integrating object relationships, including category closeness and spatial correlations, e.g., a TV usually co-occurs with a remote spatially. Both Trial-driven IL and TPN underlie robust navigation policy, instructing the agent to escape from deadlock states, such as looping or being stuck. Specifically, trial-driven IL is a type of supervision used in policy network training, while TPN, mimicking the IL supervision in unseen environment, is applied in testing. Experiment in the artificial environment AI2-Thor validates that each of the techniques is effective. When combined, the techniques bring significantly improvement over baseline methods in navigation effectiveness and efficiency in unseen environments. We report 22.8% and 23.5% increase in success rate and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaobaishu0097/ECCV-VN.git.",0

Continual learning aims to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. We hypothesize that representations learned to solve each task in a sequence have a shared structure while containing some task-specific properties. We show that shared features are significantly less prone to forgetting and propose a novel hybrid continual learning framework that learns a disjoint representation for task-invariant and task-specific features required to solve a sequence of tasks. Our model combines architecture growth to prevent forgetting of task-specific skills and an experience replay approach to preserve shared skills. We demonstrate our hybrid approach is effective in avoiding forgetting and show it is superior to both architecture-based and memory-based approaches on class incrementally learning of a single dataset as well as a sequence of multiple datasets in image classification.

"The objective of continual learning is to acquire new abilities while retaining previously gained ones. Our assumption is that the techniques employed to solve each task in a series share a common structure while also possessing unique properties specific to each task. We have discovered that the shared attributes are less susceptible to being forgotten. To address this, we have devised an innovative approach that employs a hybrid continual learning framework. This framework learns a separate representation for features that are invariant across tasks and those that are specific to each task. Our model leverages architecture growth to prevent the loss of task-specific abilities and an experience replay approach to conserve shared abilities. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in preventing forgetfulness and have proven it to be superior to both architecture-based and memory-based approaches in classifying images in a single dataset and a series of multiple datasets.

"We introduce a novel self-supervised learning approach to learn representations of videos that are responsive to changes in the motion dynamics. Our representations can be learned from data without human annotation and provide a substantial boost to the training of neural networks on small labeled data sets for tasks such as action recognition, which require to accurately distinguish the motion of objects. We promote an accurate learning of motion without human annotation by training a neural network to discriminate a video sequence from its temporally transformed versions. To learn to distinguish non-trivial motions, the design of the transformations is based on two principles: 1) To define clusters of motions based on time warps of different magnitude; 2) To ensure that the discrimination is feasible only by observing and analyzing as many image frames as possible. Thus, we introduce the following transformations: forward-backward playback, random frame skipping, and uniform frame skipping. Our experiments show that networks trained with the proposed method yield representations with improved transfer performance for action recognition on UCF101 and HMDB51.",0

"Complex categorical data is often hierarchically coupled with heterogeneous relationships between attributes and attribute values and the couplings between objects. Such value-to-object couplings are heterogeneous with complementary and inconsistent interactions and distributions. Limited research exists on unlabeled categorical data representations, ignores the heterogeneous and hierarchical couplings, underestimates data characteristics and complexities, and overuses redundant information, etc. The deep representation learning of unlabeled categorical data is challenging, overseeing such value-to-object couplings, complementarity and inconsistency, and requiring large data, disentanglement, and high computational power. This work introduces a shallow but powerful UNsupervised heTerogeneous couplIng lEarning (UNTIE) approach for representing coupled categorical data by untying the interactions between couplings and revealing heterogeneous distributions embedded in each type of couplings. UNTIE is efficiently optimized w.r.t. a kernel k-means objective function for unsupervised representation learning of heterogeneous and hierarchical value-to-object couplings. Theoretical analysis shows that UNTIE can represent categorical data with maximal separability while effectively represent heterogeneous couplings and disclose their roles in categorical data. The UNTIE-learned representations make significant performance improvement against the state-of-the-art categorical representations and deep representation models on 25 categorical data sets with diversified characteristics.",0

"Graph neural networks have achieved great success in learning node representations for graph tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Graph representation learning requires graph pooling to obtain graph representations from node representations. It is challenging to develop graph pooling methods due to the variable sizes and isomorphic structures of graphs. In this work, we propose to use second-order pooling as graph pooling, which naturally solves the above challenges. In addition, compared to existing graph pooling methods, second-order pooling is able to use information from all nodes and collect second-order statistics, making it more powerful. We show that direct use of second-order pooling with graph neural networks leads to practical problems. To overcome these problems, we propose two novel global graph pooling methods based on second-order pooling; namely, bilinear mapping and attentional second-order pooling. In addition, we extend attentional second-order pooling to hierarchical graph pooling for more flexible use in GNNs.

"The problem of catastrophic forgetting occurs in deep learning models trained on multiple databases in a sequential manner. Recently, generative replay mechanisms (GRM), have been proposed to reproduce previously learned knowledge aiming to reduce the forgetting. However, such approaches lack an appropriate inference model and therefore can not provide latent representations of data. In this paper, we propose a novel lifelong learning approach, namely the Lifelong VAEGAN (L-VAEGAN), which not only induces a powerful generative replay network but also learns meaningful latent representations, benefiting representation learning. L-VAEGAN can allow to automatically embed the information associated with different domains into several clusters in the latent space, while also capturing semantically meaningful shared latent variables, across different data domains.

"For person re-identification, existing deep networks often focus on representation learning. However, without transfer learning, the learned model is fixed as is, which is not adaptable for handling various unseen scenarios. In this paper, beyond representation learning, we consider how to formulate person image matching directly in deep feature maps. We treat image matching as finding local correspondences in feature maps, and construct query-adaptive convolution kernels on the fly to achieve local matching. In this way, the matching process and results are interpretable, and this explicit matching is more generalizable than representation features to unseen scenarios, such as unknown misalignments, pose or viewpoint changes. To facilitate end-to-end training of this architecture, we further build a class memory module to cache feature maps of the most recent samples of each class, so as to compute image matching losses for metric learning. Through direct cross-dataset evaluation, the proposed Query-Adaptive Convolution (QAConv) method gains large improvements over popular learning methods (about 10%+ mAP), and achieves comparable results to many transfer learning methods. Besides, a model-free temporal cooccurrence based score weighting method called TLift is proposed, which improves the performance to a further extent, achieving state-of-the-art results in cross-dataset person re-identification.

"Applying network science approaches to investigate the functions and anatomy of the human brain is prevalent in modern medical imaging analysis. Due to the complex network topology, for an individual brain, mining a discriminative network representation from the multimodal brain networks is non-trivial. The recent success of deep learning techniques on graph-structured data suggests a new way to model the non-linear cross-modality relationship. However, current deep brain network methods either ignore the intrinsic graph topology or require a network basis shared within a group. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end deep graph representation learning (Deep Multimodal Brain Networks - DMBN) to fuse multimodal brain networks. Specifically, we decipher the cross-modality relationship through a graph encoding and decoding process. The higher-order network mappings from brain structural networks to functional networks are learned in the node domain. The learned network representation is a set of node features that are informative to induce brain saliency maps in a supervised manner. We test our framework in both synthetic and real image data.

"Deep neural networks have gained tremendous success in a broad range of machine learning tasks due to its remarkable capability to learn semantic-rich features from high-dimensional data. However, they often require large-scale labelled data to successfully learn such features, which significantly hinders their adaption into unsupervised learning tasks, such as anomaly detection and clustering, and limits their applications into critical domains where obtaining massive labelled data is prohibitively expensive. To enable unsupervised learning on those domains, in this work we propose to learn features without using any labelled data by training neural networks to predict data distances in a randomly projected space. Random mapping is a theoretically proven approach to obtain approximately preserved distances. To well predict these random distances, the representation learner is optimised to learn genuine class structures that are implicitly embedded in the randomly projected space. Empirical results on 19 real-world datasets show that our learned representations substantially outperform a few state-of-the-art competing methods in both anomaly detection and clustering tasks.

"Graph neural networks get significant attention for graph representation and classification in machine learning community. Attention mechanism applied on the neighborhood of a node improves the performance of graph neural networks. Typically, it helps to identify a neighbor node which plays more important role to determine the label of the node under consideration. But in real world scenarios, a particular subset of nodes together, but not the individual pairs in the subset, may be important to determine the label of the graph. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of subgraph attention for graphs. On the other hand, hierarchical graph pooling has been shown to be promising in recent literature. But due to noisy hierarchical structure of real world graphs, not all the hierarchies of a graph play equal role for graph classification. Towards this end, we propose a graph classification algorithm called SubGattPool which jointly learns the subgraph attention and employs two different types of hierarchical attention mechanisms to find the important nodes in a hierarchy and the importance of individual hierarchies in a graph. Experimental evaluation with different types of graph classification algorithms shows that SubGattPool is able to improve the state-of-the-art or remains competitive on multiple publicly available graph classification datasets. We conduct further experiments on both synthetic and real world graph datasets to justify the usefulness of different components of SubGattPool and to show its consistent performance on other downstream tasks.",0

"Graph neural networks have shown significant success in the field of graph representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable. In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue.

"This paper studies the fundamental problem of learning deep generative models that consist of multiple layers of latent variables organized in top-down architectures. Such models have high expressivity and allow for learning hierarchical representations. Learning such a generative model requires inferring the latent variables for each training example based on the posterior distribution of these latent variables. The inference typically requires Markov chain Monte Caro (MCMC) that can be time consuming. In this paper, we propose to use noise initialized non-persistent short run MCMC, such as finite step Langevin dynamics initialized from the prior distribution of the latent variables, as an approximate inference engine, where the step size of the Langevin dynamics is variationally optimized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution produced by the short run MCMC and the posterior distribution.

"Joint image-text embedding is the bedrock for most Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks, where multimodality inputs are simultaneously processed for joint visual and textual understanding. In this paper, we introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over four image-text datasets (COCO, Visual Genome, Conceptual Captions, and SBU Captions), which can power heterogeneous downstream V+L tasks with joint multimodal embeddings. We design four pre-training tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Region Modeling (MRM, with three variants), Image-Text Matching (ITM), and Word-Region Alignment (WRA). Different from previous work that applies joint random masking to both modalities, we use conditional masking on pre-training tasks (i.e., masked language/region modeling is conditioned on full observation of image/text). In addition to ITM for global image-text alignment, we also propose WRA via the use of Optimal Transport (OT) to explicitly encourage fine-grained alignment between words and image regions during pre-training. Comprehensive analysis shows that both conditional masking and OT-based WRA contribute to better pre-training. We also conduct a thorough ablation study to find an optimal combination of pre-training tasks. Extensive experiments show that UNITER achieves new state of the art across six V+L tasks (over nine datasets), including Visual Question Answering, Image-Text Retrieval, Referring Expression Comprehension, Visual Commonsense Reasoning, Visual Entailment, and NLVR$^2$.

"Building in silico models to predict chemical properties and activities is a crucial step in drug discovery.

"Developing virtual models to anticipate chemical characteristics and activities is a crucial aspect of drug discovery. Nonetheless, there is often a shortage of labelled data that impedes the application of deep learning in this context. Conversely, the advancements in meta-learning have facilitated top-notch performances in few-shot learning benchmarks, leading to the question: Can meta-learning enhance deep learning performance in drug discovery projects with limited resources? In this study, we evaluate the transferability of graph neural networks initializations acquired via the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm, along with its variations FO-MAML and ANIL, for chemical properties and activities tasks.

"Several animal species (e.g., bats, dolphins, and whales) and even visually impaired humans have the remarkable ability to perform echolocation: a biological sonar used to perceive spatial layout and locate objects in the world. We explore the spatial cues contained in echoes and how they can benefit vision tasks that require spatial reasoning. First we capture echo responses in photo-realistic 3D indoor scene environments. Then we propose a novel interaction-based representation learning framework that learns useful visual features via echolocation. We show that the learned image features are useful for multiple downstream vision tasks requiring spatial reasoning---monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and visual navigation---with results comparable or even better than heavily supervised pre-training. Our work opens a new path for representation learning for embodied agents, where supervision comes from interacting with the physical world.",0

"Contrastive unsupervised representation learning (CURL) is the state-of-the-art technique to learn representations (as a set of features) from unlabelled data. While CURL has collected several empirical successes recently, theoretical understanding of its performance was still missing. In a recent work, Arora et al. (2019) provide the first generalisation bounds for CURL, relying on a Rademacher complexity. We extend their framework to the flexible PAC-Bayes setting, allowing us to deal with the non-iid setting. We present PAC-Bayesian generalisation bounds for CURL, which are then used to derive a new representation learning algorithm. Numerical experiments on real-life datasets illustrate that our algorithm achieves competitive accuracy, and yields non-vacuous generalisation bounds.",0

"In architecture and computer-aided design, wireframes (i.e., line-based models) are widely used as basic 3D models for design evaluation and fast design iterations. However, unlike a full design file, a wireframe model lacks critical information, such as detailed shape, texture, and materials, needed by a conventional renderer to produce 2D renderings of the objects or scenes. In this paper, we bridge the information gap by generating photo-realistic rendering of indoor scenes from wireframe models in an image translation framework. While existing image synthesis methods can generate visually pleasing images for common objects such as faces and birds, these methods do not explicitly model and preserve essential structural constraints in a wireframe model, such as junctions, parallel lines, and planar surfaces. To this end, we propose a novel model based on a structure-appearance joint representation learned from both images and wireframes. In our model, structural constraints are explicitly enforced by learning a joint representation in a shared encoder network that must support the generation of both images and wireframes. Experiments on a wireframe-scene dataset show that our wireframe-to-image translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and structural integrity of generated images.",0

"When learning to sketch, beginners start with simple and flexible shapes, and then gradually strive for more complex and accurate ones in the subsequent training sessions. In this paper, we design a ""shape curriculum"" for learning continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) on shapes, namely Curriculum DeepSDF. Inspired by how humans learn, Curriculum DeepSDF organizes the learning task in ascending order of difficulty according to the following two criteria: surface accuracy and sample difficulty. The former considers stringency in supervising with ground truth, while the latter regards the weights of hard training samples near complex geometry and fine structure. More specifically, Curriculum DeepSDF learns to reconstruct coarse shapes at first, and then gradually increases the accuracy and focuses more on complex local details. Experimental results show that a carefully-designed curriculum leads to significantly better shape reconstructions with the same training data, training epochs and network architecture as DeepSDF. We believe that the application of shape curricula can benefit the training process of a wide variety of 3D shape representation learning methods.",0

"In this work, we propose a new unsupervised image segmentation approach based on mutual information maximization between different constructed views of the inputs. Taking inspiration from autoregressive generative models that predict the current pixel from past pixels in a raster-scan ordering created with masked convolutions, we propose to use different orderings over the inputs using various forms of masked convolutions to construct different views of the data. For a given input, the model produces a pair of predictions with two valid orderings, and is then trained to maximize the mutual information between the two outputs. These outputs can either be low-dimensional features for representation learning or output clusters corresponding to semantic labels for clustering. While masked convolutions are used during training, in inference, no masking is applied and we fall back to the standard convolution where the model has access to the full input. The proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art on unsupervised image segmentation. It is simple and easy to implement, and can be extended to other visual tasks and integrated seamlessly into existing unsupervised learning methods requiring different views of the data.",0

"Recently there was an increasing interest in applications of graph neural networks in non-Euclidean geometry; however, are non-Euclidean representations always useful for graph learning tasks? For different problems such as node classification and link prediction we compute hyperbolic embeddings and conclude that for tasks that require global prediction consistency it might be useful to use non-Euclidean embeddings, while for other tasks Euclidean models are superior. To do so we first fix an issue of the existing models associated with the optimization process at zero curvature. Current hyperbolic models deal with gradients at the origin in ad-hoc manner, which is inefficient and can lead to numerical instabilities. We solve the instabilities of kappa-Stereographic model at zero curvature cases and evaluate the approach of embedding graphs into the manifold in several graph representation learning tasks.",0

"Dictionary learning is a classic representation learning method that has been widely applied in signal processing and data analytics.

Specifically, we prove that the global maximizers of these formulations are very close to the true dictionary with high probability, even when Gaussian noise is present. Based on the generalized power method (GPM), an efficient algorithm is then developed for the $\ell_p$-based formulations. We further show the efficacy of the developed algorithm: for the population GPM algorithm over the sphere constraint, it first quickly enters the neighborhood of a global maximizer, and then converges linearly in this region. Extensive experiments will demonstrate that the $\ell_p$-based approaches enjoy a higher computational efficiency and better robustness than conventional approaches and $p=3$ performs the best.",0

"Motivated by the previous success of Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D CNN) on image recognition, researchers endeavor to leverage it to characterize videos. However, one limitation of applying 2D CNN to analyze videos is that different frames of a video share the same 2D CNN kernels, which may result in repeated and redundant information utilization, especially in the spatial semantics extraction process, hence neglecting the critical variations among frames. In this paper, we attempt to tackle this issue through two ways. 1) Design a sequential channel filtering mechanism, i.e., Progressive Enhancement Module (PEM), to excite the discriminative channels of features from different frames step by step, and thus avoid repeated information extraction. 2) Create a Temporal Diversity Loss (TD Loss) to force the kernels to concentrate on and capture the variations among frames rather than the image regions with similar appearance. Our method is evaluated on benchmark temporal reasoning datasets Something-Something V1 and V2, and it achieves visible improvements over the best competitor by 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Besides, performance improvements over the 2D-CNN-based state-of-the-arts on the large-scale dataset Kinetics are also witnessed.",0

"Medical images are naturally associated with rich semantics about the human anatomy, reflected in an abundance of recurring anatomical patterns, offering unique potential to foster deep semantic representation learning and yield semantically more powerful models for different medical applications. But how exactly such strong yet free semantics embedded in medical images can be harnessed for self-supervised learning remains largely unexplored. To this end, we train deep models to learn semantically enriched visual representation by self-discovery, self-classification, and self-restoration of the anatomy underneath medical images, resulting in a semantics-enriched, general-purpose, pre-trained 3D model, named Semantic Genesis. We examine our Semantic Genesis with all the publicly-available pre-trained models, by either self-supervision or fully supervision, on the six distinct target tasks, covering both classification and segmentation in various medical modalities (i.e.,CT, MRI, and X-ray). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic Genesis significantly exceeds all of its 3D counterparts as well as the de facto ImageNet-based transfer learning in 2D.

"Time series prediction is an important problem in machine learning. Previous methods for time series prediction did not involve additional information. With a lot of dynamic knowledge graphs available, we can use this additional information to predict the time series better. Recently, there has been a focus on the application of deep representation learning on dynamic graphs. These methods predict the structure of the graph by reasoning over the interactions in the graph at previous time steps.

"Despite their strong modeling capacities, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often scale-sensitive. For enhancing the robustness of CNNs to scale variance, multi-scale feature fusion from different layers or filters attracts great attention among existing solutions, while the more granular kernel space is overlooked. We bridge this regret by exploiting multi-scale features in a finer granularity. The proposed convolution operation, named Poly-Scale Convolution (PSConv), mixes up a spectrum of dilation rates and tactfully allocate them in the individual convolutional kernels of each filter regarding a single convolutional layer. Specifically, dilation rates vary cyclically along the axes of input and output channels of the filters, aggregating features over a wide range of scales in a neat style. PSConv could be a drop-in replacement of the vanilla convolution in many prevailing CNN backbones, allowing better representation learning without introducing additional parameters and computational complexities. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS COCO benchmarks validate the superior performance of PSConv. Code and models are available at https://github.com/d-li14/PSConv.",0

"We consider the problem of semi-supervised 3D action recognition which has been rarely explored before. Its major challenge lies in how to effectively learn motion representations from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proved very effective at learning representations from unlabeled data in the image domain. However, few effective self-supervised approaches exist for 3D action recognition, and directly applying SSL for semi-supervised learning suffers from misalignment of representations learned from SSL and supervised learning tasks. To address these issues, we present Adversarial Self-Supervised Learning (ASSL), a novel framework that tightly couples SSL and the semi-supervised scheme via neighbor relation exploration and adversarial learning. Specifically, we design an effective SSL scheme to improve the discrimination capability of learned representations for 3D action recognition, through exploring the data relations within a neighborhood. We further propose an adversarial regularization to align the feature distributions of labeled and unlabeled samples.

"Anomaly detection-based spoof attack detection is a recent development in face Presentation Attack Detection (fPAD), where a spoof detector is learned using only non-attacked images of users. These detectors are of practical importance as they are shown to generalize well to new attack types. In this paper, we present a deep-learning solution for anomaly detection-based spoof attack detection where both classifier and feature representations are learned together end-to-end.

"In this paper, we study the problem of learning compact (low-dimensional) representations for sequential data that captures its implicit spatio-temporal cues. To maximize extraction of such informative cues from the data, we set the problem within the context of contrastive representation learning and to that end propose a novel objective via optimal transport. Specifically, our formulation seeks a low-dimensional subspace representation of the data that jointly (i) maximizes the distance of the data (embedded in this subspace) from an adversarial data distribution under the optimal transport, a.k.a. the Wasserstein distance, (ii) captures the temporal order, and (iii) minimizes the data distortion. To generate the adversarial distribution, we propose a novel framework connecting Wasserstein GANs with a classifier, allowing a principled mechanism for producing good negative distributions for contrastive learning, which is currently a challenging problem.

"The focus of this paper is to investigate the challenge of obtaining streamlined representations of sequential data that effectively capture its implicit spatio-temporal cues. We approach this problem through contrastive representation learning and introduce a new objective using optimal transport, which seeks to extract informative cues from the data. The formulation aims to produce a low-dimensional representation of the data that takes into account temporal order and minimizes data distortion, while maximizing the distance between the data and an adversarial distribution under the Wasserstein distance. To create the adversarial distribution, we propose a novel framework that combines Wasserstein GANs with a classifier. The full objective is solved using Riemannian optimization on the Grassmann manifold. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on human action recognition in video sequences and our results show promising performance compared to challenging baselines.",1
"Deep auto-encoders (DAEs) have achieved great success in learning data representations via the powerful representability of neural networks. But most DAEs only focus on the most dominant structures which are able to reconstruct the data from a latent space and neglect rich latent structural information. In this work, we propose a new representation learning method that explicitly models and leverages sample relations, which in turn is used as supervision to guide the representation learning. Different from previous work, our framework well preserves the relations between samples. Since the prediction of pairwise relations themselves is a fundamental problem, our model adaptively learns them from data. This provides much flexibility to encode real data manifold. The important role of relation and representation learning is evaluated on the clustering task. Extensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. By seeking to embed samples into subspace, we further show that our method can address the large-scale and out-of-sample problem.",0

"The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search (or, self-join) for text, DNA, and a handful of other datatypes, and these systems have been applied to many diverse data mining problems. Surprisingly, however, little progress has been made on addressing this problem for time series subsequences. In this thesis, we have introduced a near universal time series data mining tool called matrix profile which solves the all-pairs-similarity-search problem and caches the output in an easy-to-access fashion. The proposed algorithm is not only parameter-free, exact and scalable, but also applicable for both single and multidimensional time series. By building time series data mining methods on top of matrix profile, many time series data mining tasks (e.g., motif discovery, discord discovery, shapelet discovery, semantic segmentation, and clustering) can be efficiently solved. Because the same matrix profile can be shared by a diverse set of time series data mining methods, matrix profile is versatile and computed-once-use-many-times data structure. We demonstrate the utility of matrix profile for many time series data mining problems, including motif discovery, discord discovery, weakly labeled time series classification, and representation learning on domains as diverse as seismology, entomology, music processing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand monitoring, and medicine. We hope the matrix profile is not the end but the beginning of many more time series data mining projects.",0

"The graph structure of biomedical data differs from those in typical knowledge graph benchmark tasks.

"Recently deep neural networks demonstrate competitive performances in classification and regression tasks for many temporal or sequential data. However, it is still hard to understand the classification mechanisms of temporal deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose two new frameworks to visualize temporal representations learned from deep neural networks.

Furthermore, we characterize such sub-sequences with clustering and calculate the uncertainty of the suggested type and actual data. We also suggest Layer-wise Relevance from the output of a unit, not from the final output, with backward Monte-Carlo dropout to show the relevance scores of each input point to activate units with providing a visual representation of the uncertainty about this impact.",0

"State-of-the-art single depth image-based 3D hand pose estimation methods are based on dense predictions, including voxel-to-voxel predictions, point-to-point regression, and pixel-wise estimations. Despite the good performance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation learning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise prediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas are two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the relations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature representation learning; b) unifying the dense pixel-wise offset predictions and direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module to model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation capability of each pixel. Then we densely estimate all pixels' offsets to joints in both image plane and depth space and calculate the joints' positions by a weighted average over all pixels' predictions, totally discarding the complex postprocessing operations. The proposed model is implemented with an efficient 2D fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone and has only about 1.4M parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D hand pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy while running very efficiently with around a speed of 110fps on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.",0

"Training an agent to solve control tasks directly from high-dimensional images with model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has proven difficult. A promising approach is to learn a latent representation together with the control policy. However, fitting a high-capacity encoder using a scarce reward signal is sample inefficient and leads to poor performance. Prior work has shown that auxiliary losses, such as image reconstruction, can aid efficient representation learning. However, incorporating reconstruction loss into an off-policy learning algorithm often leads to training instability. We explore the underlying reasons and identify variational autoencoders, used by previous investigations, as the cause of the divergence. Following these findings, we propose effective techniques to improve training stability. This results in a simple approach capable of matching state-of-the-art model-free and model-based algorithms on MuJoCo control tasks. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates robustness to observational noise, surpassing existing approaches in this setting.

"We investigate two causes for adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks: bad data and (poorly) trained models. When trained with SGD, deep neural networks essentially achieve zero training error, even in the presence of label noise, while also exhibiting good generalization on natural test data, something referred to as benign overfitting [2, 10]. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We identify label noise as one of the causes for adversarial vulnerability, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence in support of this. Surprisingly, we find several instances of label noise in datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR, and that robustly trained models incur training error on some of these, i.e. they don't fit the noise. However, removing noisy labels alone does not suffice to achieve adversarial robustness. Standard training procedures bias neural networks towards learning ""simple"" classification boundaries, which may be less robust than more complex ones. We observe that adversarial training does produce more complex decision boundaries. We conjecture that in part the need for complex decision boundaries arises from sub-optimal representation learning. By means of simple toy examples, we show theoretically how the choice of representation can drastically affect adversarial robustness.",0
"Our investigation into the causes of adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks has led us to identify two main factors: bad data and poorly trained models. Despite achieving zero training error with SGD, deep neural networks are still susceptible to adversarial attacks due to label noise, which is a significant contributor to their vulnerability. We have found evidence of label noise in datasets like MNIST and CIFAR, and although removing these noisy labels helps, it is not enough to achieve full adversarial robustness. This is because standard training procedures favor simple classification boundaries, which are less robust than more complex ones. Adversarial training, on the other hand, produces more complex decision boundaries, which we believe is partly due to sub-optimal representation learning. Our simple toy examples demonstrate how the choice of representation can impact adversarial robustness.",1
"This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in 3D medical image processing: how to deal with imaging thickness. For anisotropic medical volumes, there is a significant performance gap between thin-slice (mostly 1mm) and thick-slice (mostly 5mm) volumes. Prior arts tend to use 3D approaches for the thin-slice and 2D approaches for the thick-slice, respectively. We aim at a unified approach for both thin- and thick-slice medical volumes. Inspired by recent advances in video analysis, we propose AlignShift, a novel parameter-free operator to convert theoretically any 2D pretrained network into thickness-aware 3D network. Remarkably, the converted networks behave like 3D for the thin-slice, nevertheless degenerate to 2D for the thick-slice adaptively. The unified thickness-aware representation learning is achieved by shifting and fusing aligned ""virtual slices"" as per the input imaging thickness. Extensive experiments on public large-scale DeepLesion benchmark, consisting of 32K lesions for universal lesion detection, validate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms previous state of the art by considerable margins without whistles and bells. More importantly, to our knowledge, this is the first method that bridges the performance gap between thin- and thick-slice volumes by a unified framework.

"Audio representation learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs) emerged as an alternative approach to hand-crafted features. For achieving high performance, DNNs often need a large amount of annotated data which can be difficult and costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a method for learning audio representations, aligning the learned latent representations of audio and associated tags. Aligning is done by maximizing the agreement of the latent representations of audio and tags, using a contrastive loss. The result is an audio embedding model which reflects acoustic and semantic characteristics of sounds. We evaluate the quality of our embedding model, measuring its performance as a feature extractor on three different tasks (namely, sound event recognition, and music genre and musical instrument classification), and investigate what type of characteristics the model captures. Our results are promising, sometimes in par with the state-of-the-art in the considered tasks and the embeddings produced with our method are well correlated with some acoustic descriptors.",0

"Messenger advertisements (ads) give direct and personal user experience yielding high conversion rates and sales. However, people are skeptical about ads and sometimes perceive them as spam, which eventually leads to a decrease in user satisfaction. Targeted advertising, which serves ads to individuals who may exhibit interest in a particular advertising message, is strongly required. The key to the success of precise user targeting lies in learning the accurate user and ad representation in the embedding space. Most of the previous studies have limited the representation learning in the Euclidean space, but recent studies have suggested hyperbolic manifold learning for the distinct projection of complex network properties emerging from real-world datasets such as social networks, recommender systems, and advertising. We propose a framework that can effectively learn the hierarchical structure in users and ads on the hyperbolic space, and extend to the Multi-Manifold Learning. Our method constructs multiple hyperbolic manifolds with learnable curvatures and maps the representation of user and ad to each manifold. The origin of each manifold is set as the centroid of each user cluster. The user preference for each ad is estimated using the distance between two entities in the hyperbolic space, and the final prediction is determined by aggregating the values calculated from the learned multiple manifolds. We evaluate our method on public benchmark datasets and a large-scale commercial messenger system LINE, and demonstrate its effectiveness through improved performance.",0

"Identifiability is a desirable property of a statistical model: it implies that the true model parameters may be estimated to any desired precision, given sufficient computational resources and data. We study identifiability in the context of representation learning: discovering nonlinear data representations that are optimal with respect to some downstream task. When parameterized as deep neural networks, such representation functions typically lack identifiability in parameter space, because they are overparameterized by design. In this paper, building on recent advances in nonlinear ICA, we aim to rehabilitate identifiability by showing that a large family of discriminative models are in fact identifiable in function space, up to a linear indeterminacy. Many models for representation learning in a wide variety of domains have been identifiable in this sense, including text, images and audio, state-of-the-art at time of publication. We derive sufficient conditions for linear identifiability and provide empirical support for the result on both simulated and real-world data.",0

"Multi-view learning is a learning task in which data is described by several concurrent representations. Its main challenge is most often to exploit the complementarities between these representations to help solve a classification/regression task. This is a challenge that can be met nowadays if there is a large amount of data available for learning. However, this is not necessarily true for all real-world problems, where data are sometimes scarce (e.g. problems related to the medical environment). In these situations, an effective strategy is to use intermediate representations based on the dissimilarities between instances. This work presents new ways of constructing these dissimilarity representations, learning them from data with Random Forest classifiers. More precisely, two methods are proposed, which modify the Random Forest proximity measure, to adapt it to the context of High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) multi-view classification problems. The second method, based on an Instance Hardness measurement, is significantly more accurate than other state-of-the-art measurements including the original RF Proximity measurement and the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) metric learning measurement.",0

"Learning discriminative powerful representations is a crucial step for machine learning systems. Introducing invariance against arbitrary nuisance or sensitive attributes while performing well on specific tasks is an important problem in representation learning. This is mostly approached by purging the sensitive information from learned representations. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement approach to invariant representation problem. We disentangle the meaningful and sensitive representations by enforcing orthogonality constraints as a proxy for independence. We explicitly enforce the meaningful representation to be agnostic to sensitive information by entropy maximization. The proposed approach is evaluated on five publicly available datasets and compared with state of the art methods for learning fairness and invariance achieving the state of the art performance on three datasets and comparable performance on the rest. Further, we perform an ablative study to evaluate the effect of each component.",0

"The problem of linking functional connectomics to behavior is extremely challenging due to the complex interactions between the two distinct, but related, data domains. We propose a coupled manifold optimization framework which projects fMRI data onto a low dimensional matrix manifold common to the cohort. The patient specific loadings simultaneously map onto a behavioral measure of interest via a second, non-linear, manifold. By leveraging the kernel trick, we can optimize over a potentially infinite dimensional space without explicitly computing the embeddings. As opposed to conventional manifold learning, which assumes a fixed input representation, our framework directly optimizes for embedding directions that predict behavior. Our optimization algorithm combines proximal gradient descent with the trust region method, which has good convergence guarantees. We validate our framework on resting state fMRI from fifty-eight patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder using three distinct measures of clinical severity. Our method outperforms traditional representation learning techniques in a cross validated setting, thus demonstrating the predictive power of our coupled objective.",0

"Can we automatically group images into semantically meaningful clusters when ground-truth annotations are absent? The task of unsupervised image classification remains an important, and open challenge in computer vision. Several recent approaches have tried to tackle this problem in an end-to-end fashion. In this paper, we deviate from recent works, and advocate a two-step approach where feature learning and clustering are decoupled. First, a self-supervised task from representation learning is employed to obtain semantically meaningful features. Second, we use the obtained features as a prior in a learnable clustering approach. In doing so, we remove the ability for cluster learning to depend on low-level features, which is present in current end-to-end learning approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that we outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins, in particular +26.6% on CIFAR10, +25.0% on CIFAR100-20 and +21.3% on STL10 in terms of classification accuracy.

"Adversarial Training (AT) is proposed to alleviate the adversarial vulnerability of machine learning models by extracting only robust features from the input, which, however, inevitably leads to severe accuracy reduction as it discards the non-robust yet useful features. This motivates us to preserve both robust and non-robust features and separate them with disentangled representation learning. Our proposed Adversarial Asymmetric Training (AAT) algorithm can reliably disentangle robust and non-robust representations without additional supervision on robustness. Empirical results show our method does not only successfully preserve accuracy by combining two representations, but also achieve much better disentanglement than previous work.",0
"To address the issue of adversarial vulnerability in machine learning models, Adversarial Training (AT) has been suggested. However, AT only retains robust features from the input, leading to a significant drop in accuracy as it discards non-robust yet valuable features. This has prompted us to develop a method that preserves both types of features through disentangled representation learning. Our proposed Adversarial Asymmetric Training (AAT) algorithm effectively separates robust and non-robust representations without the need for additional robustness supervision. Our method not only maintains accuracy by combining both representations but also achieves superior disentanglement compared to previous approaches, as demonstrated by empirical results.",1
"Visual question answering is concerned with answering free-form questions about an image. Since it requires a deep linguistic understanding of the question and the ability to associate it with various objects that are present in the image, it is an ambitious task and requires techniques from both computer vision and natural language processing. We propose a novel method that approaches the task by performing context-driven, sequential reasoning based on the objects and their semantic and spatial relationships present in the scene. As a first step, we derive a scene graph which describes the objects in the image, as well as their attributes and their mutual relationships. A reinforcement agent then learns to autonomously navigate over the extracted scene graph to generate paths, which are then the basis for deriving answers. We conduct a first experimental study on the challenging GQA dataset with manually curated scene graphs, where our method almost reaches the level of human performance.",0

"Graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing real-world problems. Various downstream graph learning tasks have benefited from its recent developments, such as node classification, similarity search, and graph classification. However, prior arts on graph representation learning focus on domain specific problems and train a dedicated model for each graph dataset, which is usually non-transferable to out-of-domain data. Inspired by the recent advances in pre-training from natural language processing and computer vision, we design Graph Contrastive Coding (GCC) -- a self-supervised graph neural network pre-training framework -- to capture the universal network topological properties across multiple networks. We design GCC's pre-training task as subgraph instance discrimination in and across networks and leverage contrastive learning to empower graph neural networks to learn the intrinsic and transferable structural representations. We conduct extensive experiments on three graph learning tasks and ten graph datasets. The results show that GCC pre-trained on a collection of diverse datasets can achieve competitive or better performance to its task-specific and trained-from-scratch counterparts. This suggests that the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm presents great potential for graph representation learning.",0

"Financial transactions constitute connections between entities and through these connections a large scale heterogeneous weighted graph is formulated. In this labyrinth of interactions that are continuously updated, there exists a variety of similarity-based patterns that can provide insights into the dynamics of the financial system. With the current work, we propose the application of Graph Representation Learning in a scalable dynamic setting as a means of capturing these patterns in a meaningful and robust way. We proceed to perform a rigorous qualitative analysis of the latent trajectories to extract real world insights from the proposed representations and their evolution over time that is to our knowledge the first of its kind in the financial sector. Shifts in the latent space are associated with known economic events and in particular the impact of the recent Covid-19 pandemic to consumer patterns.

"Most existing works on disentangled representation learning are solely built upon an marginal independence assumption: all factors in disentangled representations should be statistically independent. This assumption is necessary but definitely not sufficient for the disentangled representations without additional inductive biases in the modeling process, which is shown theoretically in recent studies. We argue in this work that disentangled representations should be characterized by their relation with observable data. In particular, we formulate such a relation through the concept of mutual information: the mutual information between each factor of the disentangled representations and data should be invariant conditioned on values of the other factors. Together with the widely accepted independence assumption, we further bridge it with the conditional independence of factors in representations conditioned on data. Moreover, we note that conditional independence of latent variables has been imposed on most VAE-type models and InfoGAN due to the artificial choice of factorized approximate posterior $q(\rvz|\rvx)$ in the encoders. Such an arrangement of encoders introduces a crucial inductive bias for disentangled representations. To demonstrate the importance of our proposed assumption and the related inductive bias, we show in experiments that violating the assumption leads to decline of disentanglement among factors in the learned representations.",0

"This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1% of the labels, we achieve 85.8% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are versatile, powerful machine learning methods that enable graph structure and feature representation learning, and have applications across many domains. For applications critically requiring interpretation, attention-based GNNs have been leveraged. However, these approaches either rely on specific model architectures or lack a joint consideration of graph structure and node features in their interpretation. Here we present a model-agnostic framework for interpreting important graph structure and node features, Graph neural networks Including SparSe inTerpretability (GISST). With any GNN model, GISST combines an attention mechanism and sparsity regularization to yield an important subgraph and node feature subset related to any graph-based task. Through a single self-attention layer, a GISST model learns an importance probability for each node feature and edge in the input graph. By including these importance probabilities in the model loss function, the probabilities are optimized end-to-end and tied to the task-specific performance. Furthermore, GISST sparsifies these importance probabilities with entropy and L1 regularization to reduce noise in the input graph topology and node features. Our GISST models achieve superior node feature and edge explanation precision in synthetic datasets, as compared to alternative interpretation approaches. Moreover, our GISST models are able to identify important graph structure in real-world datasets. We demonstrate in theory that edge feature importance and multiple edge types can be considered by incorporating them into the GISST edge probability computation. By jointly accounting for topology, node features, and edge features, GISST inherently provides simple and relevant interpretations for any GNN models and tasks.",0

"In self-supervised visual representation learning, a feature extractor is trained on a ""pretext task"" for which labels can be generated cheaply, without human annotation. A central challenge in this approach is that the feature extractor quickly learns to exploit low-level visual features such as color aberrations or watermarks and then fails to learn useful semantic representations. Much work has gone into identifying such ""shortcut"" features and hand-designing schemes to reduce their effect. Here, we propose a general framework for mitigating the effect shortcut features. Our key assumption is that those features which are the first to be exploited for solving the pretext task may also be the most vulnerable to an adversary trained to make the task harder. We show that this assumption holds across common pretext tasks and datasets by training a ""lens"" network to make small image changes that maximally reduce performance in the pretext task. Representations learned with the modified images outperform those learned without in all tested cases. Additionally, the modifications made by the lens reveal how the choice of pretext task and dataset affects the features learned by self-supervision.",0

"Deep clustering has increasingly been demonstrating superiority over conventional shallow clustering algorithms. Deep clustering algorithms usually combine representation learning with deep neural networks to achieve this performance, typically optimizing a clustering and non-clustering loss. In such cases, an autoencoder is typically connected with a clustering network, and the final clustering is jointly learned by both the autoencoder and clustering network. Instead, we propose to learn an autoencoded embedding and then search this further for the underlying manifold. For simplicity, we then cluster this with a shallow clustering algorithm, rather than a deeper network. We study a number of local and global manifold learning methods on both the raw data and autoencoded embedding, concluding that UMAP in our framework is best able to find the most clusterable manifold in the embedding, suggesting local manifold learning on an autoencoded embedding is effective for discovering higher quality discovering clusters. We quantitatively show across a range of image and time-series datasets that our method has competitive performance against the latest deep clustering algorithms, including out-performing current state-of-the-art on several. We postulate that these results show a promising research direction for deep clustering. The code can be found at https://github.com/rymc/n2d",0

"Graph neural networks are promising architecture for learning and inference with graph-structured data. Yet difficulties in modelling the ``parts'' and their ``interactions'' still persist in terms of graph classification, where graph-level representations are usually obtained by squeezing the whole graph into a single vector through graph pooling. From complex systems point of view, mixing all the parts of a system together can affect both model interpretability and predictive performance, because properties of a complex system arise largely from the interaction among its components. We analyze the intrinsic difficulty in graph classification under the unified concept of ``resolution dilemmas'' with learning theoretic recovery guarantees, and propose ``SLIM'', an inductive neural network model for Structural Landmarking and Interaction Modelling. It turns out, that by solving the resolution dilemmas, and leveraging explicit interacting relation between component parts of a graph to explain its complexity, SLIM is more interpretable, accurate, and offers new insight in graph representation learning.",0

By tackling the resolution dilemmas and explicitly considering the interactions between the component parts of a graph, SLIM offers a more accurate and interpretable approach to graph representation learning that provides new insights.",1
"This paper addresses the task of unsupervised learning of representations for action recognition in videos. Previous works proposed to utilize future prediction, or other domain-specific objectives to train a network, but achieved only limited success. In contrast, in the relevant field of image representation learning, simpler, discrimination-based methods have recently bridged the gap to fully-supervised performance. We first propose to adapt two top performing objectives in this class - instance recognition and local aggregation, to the video domain. In particular, the latter approach iterates between clustering the videos in the feature space of a network and updating it to respect the cluster with a non-parametric classification loss. We observe promising performance, but qualitative analysis shows that the learned representations fail to capture motion patterns, grouping the videos based on appearance. To mitigate this issue, we turn to the heuristic-based IDT descriptors, that were manually designed to encode motion patterns in videos. We form the clusters in the IDT space, using these descriptors as a an unsupervised prior in the iterative local aggregation algorithm. Our experiments demonstrates that this approach outperform prior work on UCF101 and HMDB51 action recognition benchmarks. We also qualitatively analyze the learned representations and show that they successfully capture video dynamics.",0

We also provide two large-scale multi-step benchmarks for biometric identification, where the visual appearance of different classes are highly relevant. In contrast to requiring the model to recognize more learned classes, we aim to learn feature representation that can be better generalized to not only previously unseen images but also unseen classes/identities. For the new setting, we propose a novel approach that performs the knowledge distillation over a large number of identities by applying the neighbourhood selection and consistency relaxation strategies to improve scalability and flexibility of the continual learning model.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools in representation learning for graphs. However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to carefully-crafted perturbations, called adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks can easily fool GNNs in making predictions for downstream tasks. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised increasing concerns for applying GNNs in safety-critical applications. Therefore, developing robust algorithms to defend adversarial attacks is of great significance. A natural idea to defend adversarial attacks is to clean the perturbed graph. It is evident that real-world graphs share some intrinsic properties. For example, many real-world graphs are low-rank and sparse, and the features of two adjacent nodes tend to be similar. In fact, we find that adversarial attacks are likely to violate these graph properties. Therefore, in this paper, we explore these properties to defend adversarial attacks on graphs. In particular, we propose a general framework Pro-GNN, which can jointly learn a structural graph and a robust graph neural network model from the perturbed graph guided by these properties. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with the state-of-the-art defense methods, even when the graph is heavily perturbed. We release the implementation of Pro-GNN to our DeepRobust repository for adversarial attacks and defenses (footnote: https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust).

"Autoencoders have been widely used for dimensional reduction and feature extraction. Various types of autoencoders have been proposed by introducing regularization terms. Most of these regularizations improve representation learning by constraining the weights in the encoder part, which maps input into hidden nodes and affects the generation of features. In this study, we show that a constraint to the decoder can also significantly improve its performance because the decoder determines how the latent variables contribute to the reconstruction of input. Inspired by the structural modal analysis method in mechanical engineering, a new modal autoencoder (MAE) is proposed by othogonalising the columns of the readout weight matrix. The new regularization helps to disentangle explanatory factors of variation and forces the MAE to extract fundamental modes in data. The learned representations are functionally independent in the reconstruction of input and perform better in consecutive classification tasks. The results were validated on the MNIST variations and USPS classification benchmark suite. Comparative experiments clearly show that the new algorithm has a surprising advantage. The new MAE introduces a very simple training principle for autoencoders and could be promising for the pre-training of deep neural networks.",0

"Representation learning models for graphs are a successful family of techniques that project nodes into feature spaces that can be exploited by other machine learning algorithms. Since many real-world networks are inherently dynamic, with interactions among nodes changing over time, these techniques can be defined both for static and for time-varying graphs. Here, we build upon the fact that the skip-gram embedding approach implicitly performs a matrix factorization, and we extend it to perform implicit tensor factorization on different tensor representations of time-varying graphs. We show that higher-order skip-gram with negative sampling (HOSGNS) is able to disentangle the role of nodes and time, with a small fraction of the number of parameters needed by other approaches. We empirically evaluate our approach using time-resolved face-to-face proximity data, showing that the learned time-varying graph representations outperform state-of-the-art methods when used to solve downstream tasks such as network reconstruction, and to predict the outcome of dynamical processes such as disease spreading.

"Graph representation learning has been extensively studied in recent years. Despite its potential in generating continuous embeddings for various networks, both the effectiveness and efficiency to infer high-quality representations toward large corpus of nodes are still challenging. Sampling is a critical point to achieve the performance goals. Prior arts usually focus on sampling positive node pairs, while the strategy for negative sampling is left insufficiently explored. To bridge the gap, we systematically analyze the role of negative sampling from the perspectives of both objective and risk, theoretically demonstrating that negative sampling is as important as positive sampling in determining the optimization objective and the resulted variance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive the theory and quantify that the negative sampling distribution should be positively but sub-linearly correlated to their positive sampling distribution. With the guidance of the theory, we propose MCNS, approximating the positive distribution with self-contrast approximation and accelerating negative sampling by Metropolis-Hastings. We evaluate our method on 5 datasets that cover extensive downstream graph learning tasks, including link prediction, node classification and personalized recommendation, on a total of 19 experimental settings. These relatively comprehensive experimental results demonstrate its robustness and superiorities.",0

The lattice representations possess unique features: firstly, they can be explicitly computed through lattice quantization but can also be efficiently learned through our novel ideas presented in this paper; secondly, they are closely related to Gaussian Variational Autoencoders, making it easy for designers who are familiar with the latter to generate discrete representations from their models; thirdly, as lattices satisfy the axioms of a group, their adoption can facilitate the learning of simple algebras for modeling binary operations between objects through symbolic formalisms, and their structures can also be learned formally using differentiation techniques. This paper will focus on establishing the foundation for exploring and leveraging the first two properties, including a new mathematical finding that links expressions used during training and inference time, as well as experimental validation conducted on two prominent datasets.",1
"Continual learning aims to learn tasks sequentially, with (often severe) constraints on the storage of old learning samples, without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose prescient continual learning, a novel experimental setting, to incorporate existing information about the classes, prior to any training data. Usually, each task in a traditional continual learning setting evaluates the model on present and past classes, the latter with a limited number of training samples. Our setting adds future classes, with no training samples at all. We introduce Ghost Model, a representation-learning-based model for continual learning using ideas from zero-shot learning. A generative model of the representation space in concert with a careful adjustment of the losses allows us to exploit insights from future classes to constraint the spatial arrangement of the past and current classes. Quantitative results on the AwA2 and aP\&Y datasets and detailed visualizations showcase the interest of this new setting and the method we propose to address it.",0

"Recent work has argued that neural networks can be understood theoretically by taking the number of channels to infinity, at which point the outputs become Gaussian process (GP) distributed. However, we note that infinite Bayesian neural networks lack a key facet of the behaviour of real neural networks: the fixed kernel, determined only by network hyperparameters, implies that they cannot do any form of representation learning. The lack of representation or equivalently kernel learning leads to less flexibility and hence worse performance, giving a potential explanation for the inferior performance of infinite networks observed in the literature (e.g. Novak et al. 2019). We give analytic results characterising the prior over representations and representation learning in finite deep linear networks. We show empirically that the representations in SOTA architectures such as ResNets trained with SGD are much closer to those suggested by our deep linear results than by the corresponding infinite network. This motivates the introduction of a new class of network: infinite networks with bottlenecks, which inherit the theoretical tractability of infinite networks while at the same time allowing representation learning.",0
"Theoretical analysis suggests that neural networks can be comprehended by treating the number of channels as infinite, resulting in Gaussian process (GP) distributed outputs. However, this approach lacks a critical aspect of real neural networks - the fixed kernel, determined solely by network hyperparameters, prohibits any form of representation learning. As a result, the networks are less flexible, leading to inferior performance compared to finite networks. Analytic results demonstrate the prior over representations and representation learning in finite deep linear networks. The representations in state-of-the-art architectures closely resemble those suggested by deep linear results, rather than infinite networks. This motivates the introduction of a new type of network: infinite networks with bottlenecks, which maintain the theoretical tractability of infinite networks while enabling representation learning.",1
"Existing approaches for graph neural networks commonly suffer from the oversmoothing issue, regardless of how neighborhoods are aggregated. Most methods also focus on transductive scenarios for fixed graphs, leading to poor generalization for unseen graphs. To address these issues, we propose a new graph neural network that considers both edge-based neighborhood relationships and node-based entity features, i.e. Graph Entities with Step Mixture via random walk (GESM). GESM employs a mixture of various steps through random walk to alleviate the oversmoothing problem, attention to dynamically reflect interrelations depending on node information, and structure-based regularization to enhance embedding representation. With intensive experiments, we show that the proposed GESM achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performances on eight benchmark graph datasets comprising transductive and inductive learning tasks. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the significance of considering global information.",0

"A major challenge in modern reinforcement learning (RL) is efficient control of dynamical systems from high-dimensional sensory observations. Learning controllable embedding (LCE) is a promising approach that addresses this challenge by embedding the observations into a lower-dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics, and utilizing it to perform control in the latent space. Two important questions in this area are how to learn a representation that is amenable to the control problem at hand, and how to achieve an end-to-end framework for representation learning and control. In this paper, we take a few steps towards addressing these questions. We first formulate a LCE model to learn representations that are suitable to be used by a policy iteration style algorithm in the latent space. We call this model control-aware representation learning (CARL). We derive a loss function for CARL that has close connection to the prediction, consistency, and curvature (PCC) principle for representation learning. We derive three implementations of CARL. In the offline implementation, we replace the locally-linear control algorithm (e.g.,~iLQR) used by the existing LCE methods with a RL algorithm, namely model-based soft actor-critic, and show that it results in significant improvement. In online CARL, we interleave representation learning and control, and demonstrate further gain in performance. Finally, we propose value-guided CARL, a variation in which we optimize a weighted version of the CARL loss function, where the weights depend on the TD-error of the current policy. We evaluate the proposed algorithms by extensive experiments on benchmark tasks and compare them with several LCE baselines.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved a lot of success on graph-structured data. However, it is observed that the performance of graph neural networks does not improve as the number of layers increases. This effect, known as over-smoothing, has been analyzed mostly in linear cases. In this paper, we build upon previous results \cite{oono2019graph} to further analyze the over-smoothing effect in the general graph neural network architecture. We show when the weight matrix satisfies the conditions determined by the spectrum of augmented normalized Laplacian, the Dirichlet energy of embeddings will converge to zero, resulting in the loss of discriminative power.

"Massive open online courses are becoming a modish way for education, which provides a large-scale and open-access learning opportunity for students to grasp the knowledge. To attract students' interest, the recommendation system is applied by MOOCs providers to recommend courses to students. However, as a course usually consists of a number of video lectures, with each one covering some specific knowledge concepts, directly recommending courses overlook students'interest to some specific knowledge concepts. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge concept recommendation. We propose an end-to-end graph neural network-based approach calledAttentionalHeterogeneous Graph Convolutional Deep Knowledge Recommender(ACKRec) for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs. Like other recommendation problems, it suffers from sparsity issues. To address this issue, we leverage both content information and context information to learn the representation of entities via graph convolution network. In addition to students and knowledge concepts, we consider other types of entities (e.g., courses, videos, teachers) and construct a heterogeneous information network to capture the corresponding fruitful semantic relationships among different types of entities and incorporate them into the representation learning process. Specifically, we use meta-path on the HIN to guide the propagation of students' preferences. With the help of these meta-paths, the students' preference distribution with respect to a candidate knowledge concept can be captured. Furthermore, we propose an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse the context information from different meta-paths, in order to capture the different interests of different students. The promising experiment results show that the proposedACKRecis able to effectively recommend knowledge concepts to students pursuing online learning in MOOCs.",0

"Image segmentation is a fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision with applications spanning multiple areas, such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and autonomous vehicles. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained traction in the design of automated segmentation pipelines. Although CNN-based models are adept at learning abstract features from raw image data, their performance is dependent on the availability and size of suitable training datasets. Additionally, these models are often unable to capture the details of object boundaries and generalize poorly to unseen classes.

"Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and their variants have been widely used in a variety of applications, such as dialog generation, image generation and disentangled representation learning. However, the existing VAE models have some limitations in different applications.

To address these issues, we propose a novel controllable variational autoencoder framework, ControlVAE, that combines a controller, inspired by automatic control theory, with the basic VAE to improve the performance of resulting generative models. Specifically, we design a new non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to automatically tune the hyperparameter (weight) added in the VAE objective using the output KL-divergence as feedback during model training. The framework is evaluated using three applications; namely, language modeling, disentangled representation learning, and image generation. The results show that ControlVAE can achieve better disentangling and reconstruction quality than the existing methods. For language modelling, it not only averts the KL-vanishing, but also improves the diversity of generated text.

"We present a lightweight solution to recover 3D pose from multi-view images captured with spatially calibrated cameras.

"Joint clustering and feature learning methods have shown remarkable performance in unsupervised representation learning. However, the training schedule alternating between feature clustering and network parameters update leads to unstable learning of visual representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Online Deep Clustering (ODC) that performs clustering and network update simultaneously rather than alternatingly. Our key insight is that the cluster centroids should evolve steadily in keeping the classifier stably updated. Specifically, we design and maintain two dynamic memory modules, i.e., samples memory to store samples labels and features, and centroids memory for centroids evolution. We break down the abrupt global clustering into steady memory update and batch-wise label re-assignment. The process is integrated into network update iterations. In this way, labels and the network evolve shoulder-to-shoulder rather than alternatingly.

"In this paper, we study a new graph learning problem: learning to count subgraph isomorphisms. Different from other traditional graph learning problems such as node classification and link prediction, subgraph isomorphism counting is NP-complete and requires more global inference to oversee the whole graph. To make it scalable for large-scale graphs and patterns, we propose a learning framework which augments different representation learning architectures and iteratively attends pattern and target data graphs to memorize subgraph isomorphisms for the global counting. We develop both small graphs (<= 1,024 subgraph isomorphisms in each) and large graphs (<= 4,096 subgraph isomorphisms in each) sets to evaluate different models. A mutagenic compound dataset, MUTAG, is also used to evaluate neural models and demonstrate the success of transfer learning. While the learning based approach is inexact, we are able to generalize to count large patterns and data graphs in linear time compared to the exponential time of the original NP-complete problem. Experimental results show that learning based subgraph isomorphism counting can speed up the traditional algorithm, VF2, 10-1,000 times with acceptable errors.

Taking a geometric approach to robust representation learning for temporal dynamic interactions, it is necessary to develop suitable metrics and a systematic methodology for comparison and for assessing the stability of an unsupervised learning method with respect to its tuning parameters. Such metrics must account for the (geometric) constraints in the physical world as well as the uncertainty associated with the learned patterns. In this paper we introduce a model-free metric based on the Procrustes distance for robust representation learning of interactions, and an optimal transport based distance metric for comparing between distributions of interaction primitives. These distance metrics can serve as an objective for assessing the stability of an interaction learning algorithm. They are also used for comparing the outcomes produced by different algorithms. Moreover, they may also be adopted as an objective function to obtain clusters and representative interaction primitives. These concepts and techniques will be introduced, along with mathematical properties, while their usefulness will be demonstrated in unsupervised learning of vehicle-to-vechicle interactions extracted from the Safety Pilot database, the world's largest database for connected vehicles.",0

"Over the last few years, graph autoencoders (AE) and variational autoencoders (VAE) emerged as powerful node embedding methods, with promising performances on challenging tasks such as link prediction and node clustering. Graph AE, VAE and most of their extensions rely on multi-layer graph convolutional networks (GCN) encoders to learn vector space representations of nodes. In this paper, we show that GCN encoders are actually unnecessarily complex for many applications. We propose to replace them by significantly simpler and more interpretable linear models w.r.t. the direct neighborhood (one-hop) adjacency matrix of the graph, involving fewer operations, fewer parameters and no activation function. For the two aforementioned tasks, we show that this simpler approach consistently reaches competitive performances w.r.t. GCN-based graph AE and VAE for numerous real-world graphs, including all benchmark datasets commonly used to evaluate graph AE and VAE. Based on these results, we also question the relevance of repeatedly using these datasets to compare complex graph AE and VAE.",0

These methods rely on multi-layer graph convolutional networks to learn node representations, but we argue that these networks are overly complex for many applications. Instead, we propose using simpler linear models based on the one-hop adjacency matrix, which require fewer operations and parameters and no activation function. Our experiments show that this simpler approach performs competitively with GCN-based methods on a variety of real-world graphs, including all common benchmark datasets. This raises questions about the usefulness of repeatedly evaluating graph AE and VAE on these datasets.",1
"Self-supervised learning allows for better utilization of unlabelled data. The feature representation obtained by self-supervision can be used in downstream tasks such as classification, object detection, segmentation, and anomaly detection. While classification, object detection, and segmentation have been investigated with self-supervised learning, anomaly detection needs more attention. We consider the problem of anomaly detection in images and videos, and present a new visual anomaly detection technique for videos. Numerous seminal and state-of-the-art self-supervised methods are evaluated for anomaly detection on a variety of image datasets. The best performing image-based self-supervised representation learning method is then used for video anomaly detection to see the importance of spatial features in visual anomaly detection in videos. We also propose a simple self-supervision approach for learning temporal coherence across video frames without the use of any optical flow information. At its core, our method identifies the frame indices of a jumbled video sequence allowing it to learn the spatiotemporal features of the video. This intuitive approach shows superior performance of visual anomaly detection compared to numerous methods for images and videos on UCF101 and ILSVRC2015 video datasets.",0

"Organizations that own data face increasing legal liability for its discriminatory use against protected demographic groups, extending to contractual transactions involving third parties access and use of the data. This is problematic, since the original data owner cannot ex-ante anticipate all its future uses by downstream users. This paper explores the upstream ability to preemptively remove the correlations between features and sensitive attributes by mapping features to a fair representation space. Our main result shows that the fairness measured by the demographic parity of the representation distribution can be certified from a finite sample if and only if the chi-squared mutual information between features and representations is finite. Empirically, we find that smoothing the representation distribution provides generalization guarantees of fairness certificates, which improves upon existing fair representation learning approaches. Moreover, we do not observe that smoothing the representation distribution degrades the accuracy of downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods in fair representation learning.",0

"To learn intrinsic low-dimensional structures from high-dimensional data that most discriminate between classes, we propose the principle of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction ($\text{MCR}^2$), an information-theoretic measure that maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset and the sum of each individual class. We clarify its relationships with most existing frameworks such as cross-entropy, information bottleneck, information gain, contractive and contrastive learning, and provide theoretical guarantees for learning diverse and discriminative features. The coding rate can be accurately computed from finite samples of degenerate subspace-like distributions and can learn intrinsic representations in supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised settings in a unified manner. Empirically, the representations learned using this principle alone are significantly more robust to label corruptions in classification than those using cross-entropy, and can lead to state-of-the-art results in clustering mixed data from self-learned invariant features.",0

"Many tasks in computer vision are often calibrated and evaluated relative to human perception. In this paper, we propose to directly approximate the perceptual function performed by human observers completing a visual detection task. Specifically, we present a novel methodology for learning to detect image transformations visible to human observers through approximating perceptual thresholds. To do this, we carry out a subjective two-alternative forced-choice study to estimate perceptual thresholds of human observers detecting local exposure shifts in images. We then leverage transformation equivariant representation learning to overcome issues of limited perceptual data. This representation is then used to train a dense convolutional classifier capable of detecting local suprathreshold exposure shifts - a distortion common to image composites. In this context, our model can approximate perceptual thresholds with an average error of 0.1148 exposure stops between empirical and predicted thresholds. It can also be trained to detect a range of different local transformations.",0

"With the dramatic increase of dimensions in the data representation, extracting latent low-dimensional features becomes of the utmost importance for efficient classification. Aiming at the problems of unclear margin representation and difficulty in revealing the data manifold structure in most of the existing linear discriminant methods, we propose a new discriminant feature extraction framework, namely Robust Locality-Aware Regression (RLAR). In our model, we introduce a retargeted regression to perform the marginal representation learning adaptively instead of using the general average inter-class margin. Besides, we formulate a new strategy for enhancing the local intra-class compactness of the data manifold, which can achieve the joint learning of locality-aware graph structure and desirable projection matrix. To alleviate the disturbance of outliers and prevent overfitting, we measure the regression term and locality-aware term together with the regularization term by the L2,1 norm. Further, forcing the row sparsity on the projection matrix through the L2,1 norm achieves the cooperation of feature selection and feature extraction. Then, we derive an effective iterative algorithm for solving the proposed model. The experimental results over a range of UCI data sets and other benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed RLAR outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches.",0

"In recent years, we have witnessed a surge of interest in multi-view representation learning, which is concerned with the problem of learning representations of multi-view data. When facing multiple views that are highly related but sightly different from each other, most of existing multi-view methods might fail to fully integrate multi-view information. Besides, correlations between features from multiple views always vary seriously, which makes multi-view representation challenging. Therefore, how to learn appropriate embedding from multi-view information is still an open problem but challenging. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-view learning method, named Multi-view Low-rank Preserving Embedding (MvLPE). It integrates different views into one centroid view by minimizing the disagreement term, based on distance or similarity matrix among instances, between the centroid view and each view meanwhile maintaining low-rank reconstruction relations among samples for each view, which could make more full use of compatible and complementary information from multi-view features. Unlike existing methods with additive parameters, the proposed method could automatically allocate a suitable weight for each view in multi-view information fusion. However, MvLPE couldn't be directly solved, which makes the proposed MvLPE difficult to obtain an analytic solution. To this end, we approximate this solution based on stationary hypothesis and normalization post-processing to efficiently obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, an iterative alternating strategy is provided to solve this multi-view representation problem. The experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts while achieving very competitive performance.",0

"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been drawing significant attention with the power of representation learning on graphs.

"As a crucial component in intelligent transportation systems, traffic flow prediction has recently attracted widespread research interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the increasing availability of massive traffic mobility data. Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse factors (such as temporal rules and spatial dependencies) to infer the evolution trend of traffic flow. To address this problem, we propose a unified neural network called Attentive Traffic Flow Machine (ATFM), which can effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of traffic flow with an attention mechanism. In particular, our ATFM is composed of two progressive Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM \cite{xingjian2015convolutional}) units connected with a convolutional layer. Specifically, the first ConvLSTM unit takes normal traffic flow features as input and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into the connected convolutional layer for spatial attention map inference. The second ConvLSTM unit aims at learning the dynamic spatial-temporal representations from the attentionally weighted traffic flow features. Further, we develop two deep learning frameworks based on ATFM to predict citywide short-term/long-term traffic flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential and periodic data as well as other external influences. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for traffic flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of our method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger pickup/dropoff demands in traffic prediction and show its superior performance.

"Recent years have witnessed the remarkable progress of applying deep learning models in video person re-identification (Re-ID). A key factor for video person Re-ID is to effectively construct discriminative and robust video feature representations for many complicated situations. Part-based approaches employ spatial and temporal attention to extract representative local features. While correlations between parts are ignored in the previous methods, to leverage the relations of different parts, we propose an innovative adaptive graph representation learning scheme for video person Re-ID, which enables the contextual interactions between relevant regional features. Specifically, we exploit the pose alignment connection and the feature affinity connection to construct an adaptive structure-aware adjacency graph, which models the intrinsic relations between graph nodes. We perform feature propagation on the adjacency graph to refine regional features iteratively, and the neighbor nodes' information is taken into account for part feature representation. To learn compact and discriminative representations, we further propose a novel temporal resolution-aware regularization, which enforces the consistency among different temporal resolutions for the same identities. We conduct extensive evaluations on four benchmarks, i.e. iLIDS-VID, PRID2011, MARS, and DukeMTMC-VideoReID, experimental results achieve the competitive performance which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

"In real-world classification problems, pairwise supervision (i.e., a pair of patterns with a binary label indicating whether they belong to the same class or not) can often be obtained at a lower cost than ordinary class labels. Similarity learning is a general framework to utilize such pairwise supervision to elicit useful representations by inferring the relationship between two data points, which encompasses various important preprocessing tasks such as metric learning, kernel learning, graph embedding, and contrastive representation learning. Although elicited representations are expected to perform well in downstream tasks such as classification, little theoretical insight has been given in the literature so far. In this paper, we reveal that a specific formulation of similarity learning is strongly related to the objective of binary classification, which spurs us to learn a binary classifier without ordinary class labels---by fitting the product of real-valued prediction functions of pairwise patterns to their similarity. Our formulation of similarity learning does not only generalize many existing ones, but also admits an excess risk bound showing an explicit connection to classification. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed method on benchmark datasets.",0

"The recent GRAPH-BERT model introduces a new approach to learning graph representations merely based on the attention mechanism. GRAPH-BERT provides an opportunity for transferring pre-trained models and learned graph representations across different tasks within the same graph dataset. In this paper, we will further investigate the graph-to-graph transfer of a universal GRAPH-BERT for graph representation learning across different graph datasets, and our proposed model is also referred to as the G5 for simplicity. Many challenges exist in learning G5 to adapt the distinct input and output configurations for each graph data source, as well as the information distributions differences. G5 introduces a pluggable model architecture: (a) each data source will be pre-processed with a unique input representation learning component; (b) each output application task will also have a specific functional component; and (c) all such diverse input and output components will all be conjuncted with a universal GRAPH-BERT core component via an input size unification layer and an output representation fusion layer, respectively.   The G5 model removes the last obstacle for cross-graph representation learning and transfer. For the graph sources with very sparse training data, the G5 model pre-trained on other graphs can still be utilized for representation learning with necessary fine-tuning. What's more, the architecture of G5 also allows us to learn a supervised functional classifier for data sources without any training data at all. Such a problem is also named as the Apocalypse Learning task in this paper. Two different label reasoning strategies, i.e., Cross-Source Classification Consistency Maximization (CCCM) and Cross-Source Dynamic Routing (CDR), are introduced in this paper to address the problem.",0

"The generalization and learning speed of a multi-class neural network can often be significantly improved by using soft targets that are a weighted average of the hard targets and the uniform distribution over labels. Smoothing the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming over-confident and label smoothing has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classification, language translation and speech recognition. Despite its widespread use, label smoothing is still poorly understood. Here we show empirically that in addition to improving generalization, label smoothing improves model calibration which can significantly improve beam-search. However, we also observe that if a teacher network is trained with label smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much less effective. To explain these observations, we visualize how label smoothing changes the representations learned by the penultimate layer of the network. We show that label smoothing encourages the representations of training examples from the same class to group in tight clusters. This results in loss of information in the logits about resemblances between instances of different classes, which is necessary for distillation, but does not hurt generalization or calibration of the model's predictions.",0

For instance, our approach achieves accuracies of 86.8% and 84.5% on the Cora (node) and Reddit-Binary (graph) classification benchmarks, respectively, which represent a 5.5% and 2.4% improvement compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Moreover, our approach outperforms supervised baselines in four out of eight benchmarks. The source code for our approach is available at: https://github.com/kavehhassani/mvgrl.",1
"Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a statistical technique used to extract common information from multiple data sources or views. It has been used in various representation learning problems, such as dimensionality reduction, word embedding, and clustering. Recent work has given CCA probabilistic footing in a deep learning context and uses a variational lower bound for the data log likelihood to estimate model parameters. Alternatively, adversarial techniques have arisen in recent years as a powerful alternative to variational Bayesian methods in autoencoders. In this work, we explore straightforward adversarial alternatives to recent work in Deep Variational CCA (VCCA and VCCA-Private) we call ACCA and ACCA-Private and show how these approaches offer a stronger and more flexible way to match the approximate posteriors coming from encoders to much larger classes of priors than the VCCA and VCCA-Private models. This allows new priors for what constitutes a good representation, such as disentangling underlying factors of variation, to be more directly pursued. We offer further analysis on the multi-level disentangling properties of VCCA-Private and ACCA-Private through the use of a newly designed dataset we call Tangled MNIST. We also design a validation criteria for these models that is theoretically grounded, task-agnostic, and works well in practice. Lastly, we fill a minor research gap by deriving an additional variational lower bound for VCCA that allows the representation to use view-specific information from both input views.",0

"Disentangled representation learning has recently attracted a significant amount of attention, particularly in the field of image representation learning. However, learning the disentangled representations behind a graph remains largely unexplored, especially for the attributed graph with both node and edge features. Disentanglement learning for graph generation has substantial new challenges including 1) the lack of graph deconvolution operations to jointly decode node and edge attributes; and 2) the difficulty in enforcing the disentanglement among latent factors that respectively influence: i) only nodes, ii) only edges, and iii) joint patterns between them. To address these challenges, we propose a new disentanglement enhancement framework for deep generative models for attributed graphs. In particular, a novel variational objective is proposed to disentangle the above three types of latent factors, with novel architecture for node and edge deconvolutions. Moreover, within each type, individual-factor-wise disentanglement is further enhanced, which is shown to be a generalization of the existing framework for images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its extensions.",0

"Generating interpretable visualizations from complex data is a common problem in many applications. Two key ingredients for tackling this issue are clustering and representation learning. However, current methods do not yet successfully combine the strengths of these two approaches. Existing representation learning models which rely on latent topological structure such as self-organising maps, exhibit markedly lower clustering performance compared to recent deep clustering methods. To close this performance gap, we (a) present a novel way to fit self-organizing maps with probabilistic cluster assignments (PSOM), (b) propose a new deep architecture for probabilistic clustering (DPSOM) using a VAE, and (c) extend our architecture for time-series clustering (T-DPSOM), which also allows forecasting in the latent space using LSTMs. We show that DPSOM achieves superior clustering performance compared to current deep clustering methods on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST, while maintaining the favourable visualization properties of SOMs. On medical time series, we show that T-DPSOM outperforms baseline methods in time series clustering and time series forecasting, while providing interpretable visualizations of patient state trajectories and uncertainty estimation.",0

"We present a novel architecture named Neural Physicist (NeurPhy) to learn physical dynamics directly from image sequences using deep neural networks. For any physical system, given the global system parameters, the time evolution of states is governed by the underlying physical laws. How to learn meaningful system representations in an end-to-end way and estimate accurate state transition dynamics facilitating long-term prediction have been long-standing challenges. In this paper, by leveraging recent progresses in representation learning and state space models (SSMs), we propose NeurPhy, which uses variational auto-encoder (VAE) to extract underlying Markovian dynamic state at each time step, neural process (NP) to extract the global system parameters, and a non-linear non-recurrent stochastic state space model to learn the physical dynamic transition. We apply NeurPhy to two physical experimental environments, i.e., damped pendulum and planetary orbits motion, and achieve promising results. Our model can not only extract the physically meaningful state representations, but also learn the state transition dynamics enabling long-term predictions for unseen image sequences. Furthermore, from the manifold dimension of the latent state space, we can easily identify the degree of freedom (DoF) of the underlying physical systems.",0

"Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful class of deep generative latent variable model for unsupervised representation learning on high-dimensional data. To ensure computational tractability, VAEs are often implemented with a univariate standard Gaussian prior and a mean-field Gaussian variational posterior distribution. This results in a vector-valued latent variables that are agnostic to the original data structure which might be highly correlated across and within multiple dimensions. We propose a tensor-variate extension to the VAE framework, the tensor-variate Gaussian process prior variational autoencoder (tvGP-VAE), which replaces the standard univariate Gaussian prior and posterior distributions with tensor-variate Gaussian processes. The tvGP-VAE is able to explicitly model correlation structures via the use of kernel functions over the dimensions of tensor-valued latent variables. Using spatiotemporally correlated image time series as an example, we show that the choice of which correlation structures to explicitly represent in the latent space has a significant impact on model performance in terms of reconstruction.",0

"Deep representation learning on non-Euclidean data types, such as graphs, has gained significant attention in recent years. Invent of graph neural networks has improved the state-of-the-art for both node and the entire graph representation in a vector space. However, for the entire graph representation, most of the existing graph neural networks are trained on a graph classification loss in a supervised way. But obtaining labels of a large number of graphs is expensive for real world applications. Thus, we aim to propose an unsupervised graph neural network to generate a vector representation of an entire graph in this paper. For this purpose, we combine the idea of hierarchical graph neural networks and mutual information maximization into a single framework. We also propose and use the concept of periphery representation of a graph and show its usefulness in the proposed algorithm which is referred as GraPHmax. We conduct thorough experiments on several real-world graph datasets and compare the performance of GraPHmax with a diverse set of both supervised and unsupervised baseline algorithms.

"The remarkable success of machine learning has fostered a growing number of cloud-based intelligent services for mobile users. Such a service requires a user to send data, e.g. image, voice and video, to the provider, which presents a serious challenge to user privacy. To address this, prior works either obfuscate the data, e.g. add noise and remove identity information, or send representations extracted from the data, e.g. anonymized features. They struggle to balance between the service utility and data privacy because obfuscated data reduces utility and extracted representation may still reveal sensitive information.   This work departs from prior works in methodology: we leverage adversarial learning to a better balance between privacy and utility. We design a \textit{representation encoder} that generates the feature representations to optimize against the privacy disclosure risk of sensitive information (a measure of privacy) by the \textit{privacy adversaries}, and concurrently optimize with the task inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by the \textit{utility discriminator}. The result is the privacy adversarial network (\systemname), a novel deep model with the new training algorithm, that can automatically learn representations from the raw data.   Intuitively, PAN adversarially forces the extracted representations to only convey the information required by the target task. Surprisingly, this constitutes an implicit regularization that actually improves task accuracy. As a result, PAN achieves better utility and better privacy at the same time! We report extensive experiments on six popular datasets and demonstrate the superiority of \systemname compared with alternative methods reported in prior work.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted much attention because of their excellent performance on tasks such as node classification.

"Learning disentangled representations of natural language is essential for many NLP tasks, e.g., conditional text generation, style transfer, personalized dialogue systems, etc. Similar problems have been studied extensively for other forms of data, such as images and videos. However, the discrete nature of natural language makes the disentangling of textual representations more challenging (e.g., the manipulation over the data space cannot be easily achieved). Inspired by information theory, we propose a novel method that effectively manifests disentangled representations of text, without any supervision on semantics. A new mutual information upper bound is derived and leveraged to measure dependence between style and content. By minimizing this upper bound, the proposed method induces style and content embeddings into two independent low-dimensional spaces. Experiments on both conditional text generation and text-style transfer demonstrate the high quality of our disentangled representation in terms of content and style preservation.",0

"In recent years, several unsupervised, ""contrastive"" learning algorithms in vision have been shown to learn representations that perform remarkably well on transfer tasks. We show that this family of algorithms maximizes a lower bound on the mutual information between two or more ""views"" of an image where typical views come from a composition of image augmentations. Our bound generalizes the InfoNCE objective to support negative sampling from a restricted region of ""difficult"" contrasts. We find that the choice of negative samples and views are critical to the success of these algorithms. Reformulating previous learning objectives in terms of mutual information also simplifies and stabilizes them. In practice, our new objectives yield representations that outperform those learned with previous approaches for transfer to classification, bounding box detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection. % experiments show that choosing more difficult negative samples results in a stronger representation, outperforming those learned with IR, LA, and CMC in classification, bounding box detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection.

"It has witnessed a growing demand for efficient representation learning on point clouds in many 3D computer vision applications. Behind the success story of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is that the data (e.g., images) are Euclidean structured. However, point clouds are irregular and unordered. Various point neural networks have been developed with isotropic filters or using weighting matrices to overcome the structure inconsistency on point clouds. However, isotropic filters or weighting matrices limit the representation power. In this paper, we propose a permutable anisotropic convolutional operation (PAI-Conv) that calculates soft-permutation matrices for each point using dot-product attention according to a set of evenly distributed kernel points on a sphere's surface and performs shared anisotropic filters. In fact, dot product with kernel points is by analogy with the dot-product with keys in Transformer as widely used in natural language processing (NLP). From this perspective, PAI-Conv can be regarded as the transformer for point clouds, which is physically meaningful and is robust to cooperate with the efficient random point sampling method.

"The recent success of self-supervised learning can be largely attributed to content-preserving transformations, which can be used to easily induce invariances. While transformations generate positive sample pairs in contrastive loss training, most recent work focuses on developing new objective formulations, and pays relatively little attention to the transformations themselves. In this paper, we introduce the framework of Generalized Data Transformations to (1) reduce several recent self-supervised learning objectives to a single formulation for ease of comparison, analysis, and extension, (2) allow a choice between being invariant or distinctive to data transformations, obtaining different supervisory signals, and (3) derive the conditions that combinations of transformations must obey in order to lead to well-posed learning objectives. This framework allows both invariance and distinctiveness to be injected into representations simultaneously, and lets us systematically explore novel contrastive objectives. We apply it to study multi-modal self-supervision for audio-visual representation learning from unlabelled videos, improving the state-of-the-art by a large margin, and even surpassing supervised pretraining. We demonstrate results on a variety of downstream video and audio classification and retrieval tasks, on datasets such as HMDB-51, UCF-101, DCASE2014, ESC-50 and VGG-Sound.

We define entanglement as how close pairs of points from the same class or structure are, relative to pairs of points from different classes or structures. To measure the entanglement of data points, we use the soft nearest neighbor loss, and expand it by introducing an annealing temperature factor.

"We consider representation learning (hypothesis class $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{F}\circ\mathcal{G}$) where training and test distributions can be different. Recent studies provide hints and failure examples for domain invariant representation learning, a common approach for this problem, but the explanations provided are somewhat different and do not provide a unified picture. In this paper, we provide new decompositions of risk which give finer-grained explanations and clarify potential generalization issues. For Single-Source Domain Adaptation, we give an exact decomposition (an equality) of the target risk, via a natural hybrid argument, as sum of three factors: (1) source risk, (2) representation conditional label divergence, and (3) representation covariate shift. We derive a similar decomposition for the Multi-Source case. These decompositions reveal factors (2) and (3) as the precise reasons for failure to generalize. For example, we demonstrate that domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) attempt to regularize for (3) but miss (2), while a recent technique Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) attempts to account for (2) but does not consider (3).

"In recent years, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown tremendous success in leveraging unlabeled data to improve the performance of deep learning models, which significantly reduces the demand for large amounts of labeled data. Many SSL techniques have been proposed and have shown promising performance on famous datasets such as ImageNet and CIFAR-10.

Therefore, this work proposes the pseudo-representation labeling, a simple and flexible framework that utilizes pseudo-labeling techniques to iteratively label a small amount of unlabeled data and use them as training data. In addition, our framework is integrated with self-supervised representation learning such that the classifier gains benefits from representation learning of both labeled and unlabeled data. This framework can be implemented without being limited at the specific model structure, but a general technique to improve the existing model. Compared with the existing approaches, the pseudo-representation labeling is more intuitive and can effectively solve practical problems in the real world.

"There is an increasing interest in image-to-image translation with applications ranging from generating maps from satellite images to creating entire clothes' images from only contours. In the present work, we investigate image-to-image translation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating new data, taking as a case study the morphing of giraffes images into bird images. Morphing a giraffe into a bird is a challenging task, as they have different scales, textures, and morphology. An unsupervised cross-domain translator entitled InstaGAN was trained on giraffes and birds, along with their respective masks, to learn translation between both domains. A dataset of synthetic bird images was generated using translation from originally giraffe images while preserving the original spatial arrangement and background. It is important to stress that the generated birds do not exist, being only the result of a latent representation learned by InstaGAN. Two subsets of common literature datasets were used for training the GAN and generating the translated images: COCO and Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011. To evaluate the realness and quality of the generated images and masks, qualitative and quantitative analyses were made. For the quantitative analysis, a pre-trained Mask R-CNN was used for the detection and segmentation of birds on Pascal VOC, Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011, and our new dataset entitled FakeSet. The generated dataset achieved detection and segmentation results close to the real datasets, suggesting that the generated images are realistic enough to be detected and segmented by a state-of-the-art deep neural network.",0
"The use of image-to-image translation has become increasingly popular in a variety of applications, ranging from creating satellite maps to generating full clothing images from mere outlines. In this study, we explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image-to-image translation, focusing on the challenging task of morphing giraffe images into bird images. Due to their differing scales, textures, and morphology, this task presents a significant challenge. To overcome this, we trained an unsupervised cross-domain translator called InstaGAN on giraffes and birds, as well as their corresponding masks, to learn how to translate between the two domains. We generated a set of synthetic bird images by translating giraffe images while preserving the original spatial arrangement and background. Notably, these generated bird images do not actually exist and are only the result of the latent representation learned by InstaGAN. We used two subsets of common literature datasets, COCO and Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011, for training the GAN and generating translated images. We conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated images and masks.

"Geometric representation learning has recently shown great promise in several machine learning settings, ranging from relational learning to language processing and generative models. In this work, we consider the problem of performing manifold-valued regression onto an hyperbolic space as an intermediate component for a number of relevant machine learning applications. In particular, by formulating the problem of predicting nodes of a tree as a manifold regression task in the hyperbolic space, we propose a novel perspective on two challenging tasks: 1) hierarchical classification via label embeddings and 2) taxonomy extension of hyperbolic representations. To address the regression problem we consider previous methods as well as proposing two novel approaches that are computationally more advantageous: a parametric deep learning model that is informed by the geodesics of the target space and a non-parametric kernel-method for which we also prove excess risk bounds. Our experiments show that the strategy of leveraging the hyperbolic geometry is promising. In particular, in the taxonomy expansion setting, we find that the hyperbolic-based estimators significantly outperform methods performing regression in the ambient Euclidean space.",0

"This work analyses the impact of self-supervised pre-training on document images in the context of document image classification. While previous approaches explore the effect of self-supervision on natural images, we show that patch-based pre-training performs poorly on document images because of their different structural properties and poor intra-sample semantic information. We propose two context-aware alternatives to improve performance on the Tobacco-3482 image classification task. We also propose a novel method for self-supervision, which makes use of the inherent multi-modality of documents (image and text), which performs better than other popular self-supervised methods, including supervised ImageNet pre-training, on document image classification scenarios with a limited amount of data.",0

"With the advent of agriculture 3.0 and 4.0, researchers are increasingly focusing on the development of innovative smart farming and precision agriculture technologies by introducing automation and robotics into the agricultural processes. Autonomous agricultural field machines have been gaining significant attention from farmers and industries to reduce costs, human workload, and required resources. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient autonomous navigation capabilities requires the simultaneous cooperation of different processes; localization, mapping, and path planning are just some of the steps that aim at providing to the machine the right set of skills to operate in semi-structured and unstructured environments. In this context, this study presents a low-cost local motion planner for autonomous navigation in vineyards based only on an RGB-D camera, low range hardware, and a dual layer control algorithm. The first algorithm exploits the disparity map and its depth representation to generate a proportional control for the robotic platform. Concurrently, a second back-up algorithm, based on representations learning and resilient to illumination variations, can take control of the machine in case of a momentaneous failure of the first block. Moreover, due to the double nature of the system, after initial training of the deep learning model with an initial dataset, the strict synergy between the two algorithms opens the possibility of exploiting new automatically labeled data, coming from the field, to extend the existing model knowledge. The machine learning algorithm has been trained and tested, using transfer learning, with acquired images during different field surveys in the North region of Italy and then optimized for on-device inference with model pruning and quantization. Finally, the overall system has been validated with a customized robot platform in the relevant environment.",0

"Contrastive learning (CL) is an emerging analysis approach that aims to discover unique patterns in one dataset relative to another. By applying this approach to network analysis, we can reveal unique characteristics in one network by contrasting with another. For example, with networks of protein interactions obtained from normal and cancer tissues, we can discover unique types of interactions in cancer tissues. However, existing CL methods cannot be directly applied to networks. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach called contrastive network representation learning (cNRL). This approach embeds network nodes into a low-dimensional space that reveals the uniqueness of one network compared to another. Within this approach, we also design a method, named i-cNRL, that offers interpretability in the learned results, allowing for understanding which specific patterns are found in one network but not the other. We demonstrate the capability of i-cNRL with multiple network models and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons across i-cNRL and other potential cNRL algorithm designs.",0

"Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) refers to matching face images acquired from different domains with wide applications in security scenarios. This paper presents a deep neural network approach namely Multi-Margin based Decorrelation Learning (MMDL) to extract decorrelation representations in a hyperspherical space for cross-domain face images. The proposed framework can be divided into two components: heterogeneous representation network and decorrelation representation learning. First, we employ a large scale of accessible visual face images to train heterogeneous representation network. The decorrelation layer projects the output of the first component into decorrelation latent subspace and obtains decorrelation representation. In addition, we design a multi-margin loss (MML), which consists of quadruplet margin loss (QML) and heterogeneous angular margin loss (HAML), to constrain the proposed framework.

"Understanding three-dimensional (3D) geometries from two-dimensional (2D) images without any labeled information is promising for understanding the real world without incurring annotation cost. We herein propose a novel generative model, RGBD-GAN, which achieves unsupervised 3D representation learning from 2D images. The proposed method enables camera parameter-conditional image generation and depth image generation without any 3D annotations, such as camera poses or depth. We use an explicit 3D consistency loss for two RGBD images generated from different camera parameters, in addition to the ordinal GAN objective.

"Recent years have witnessed the emergence and development of graph neural networks (GNNs), which have been shown as a powerful approach for graph representation learning in many tasks, such as node classification and graph classification. The research on the robustness of these models has also started to attract attentions in the machine learning field. However, most of the existing work in this area focus on the GNNs for node-level tasks, while little work has been done to study the robustness of the GNNs for the graph classification task. In this paper, we aim to explore the vulnerability of the Hierarchical Graph Pooling (HGP) Neural Networks, which are advanced GNNs that perform very well in the graph classification in terms of prediction accuracy. We propose an adversarial attack framework for this task. Specifically, we design a surrogate model that consists of convolutional and pooling operators to generate adversarial samples to fool the hierarchical GNN-based graph classification models. We set the preserved nodes by the pooling operator as our attack targets, and then we perturb the attack targets slightly to fool the pooling operator in hierarchical GNNs so that they will select the wrong nodes to preserve. We show the adversarial samples generated from multiple datasets by our surrogate model have enough transferability to attack current state-of-art graph classification models. Furthermore, we conduct the robust train on the target models and demonstrate that the retrained graph classification models are able to better defend against the attack from the adversarial samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the adversarial attack against hierarchical GNN-based graph classification models.",0

"We address the challenging problem of RGB image-based head pose estimation. We first reformulate head pose representation learning to constrain it to a bounded space. Head pose represented as vector projection or vector angles shows helpful to improving performance. Further, a ranking loss combined with MSE regression loss is proposed. The ranking loss supervises a neural network with paired samples of the same person and penalises incorrect ordering of pose prediction. Analysis on this new loss function suggests it contributes to a better local feature extractor, where features are generalised to Abstract Landmarks which are pose-related features instead of pose-irrelevant information such as identity, age, and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art schemes on public datasets: AFLW2000 and BIWI. Our model achieves significant improvements over previous SOTA MAE on AFLW2000 and BIWI from 4.50 to 3.66 and from 4.0 to 3.71 respectively. Source code will be made available at: https://github.com/seathiefwang/RankHeadPose.",0

"In many machine learning tasks, learning a good representation of the data can be the key to building a well-performant solution. This is because most learning algorithms operate with the features in order to find models for the data. For instance, classification performance can improve if the data is mapped to a space where classes are easily separated, and regression can be facilitated by finding a manifold of data in the feature space. As a general rule, features are transformed by means of statistical methods such as principal component analysis, or manifold learning techniques such as Isomap or locally linear embedding. From a plethora of representation learning methods, one of the most versatile tools is the autoencoder. In this paper we aim to demonstrate how to influence its learned representations to achieve the desired learning behavior. To this end, we present a series of learning tasks: data embedding for visualization, image denoising, semantic hashing, detection of abnormal behaviors and instance generation. We model them from the representation learning perspective, following the state of the art methodologies in each field. A solution is proposed for each task employing autoencoders as the only learning method. The theoretical developments are put into practice using a selection of datasets for the different problems and implementing each solution, followed by a discussion of the results in each case study and a brief explanation of other six learning applications. We also explore the current challenges and approaches to explainability in the context of autoencoders. All of this helps conclude that, thanks to alterations in their structure as well as their objective function, autoencoders may be the core of a possible solution to many problems which can be modeled as a transformation of the feature space.",0

"Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection lies at the core of action understanding. Besides 2D information such as human/object appearance and locations, 3D pose is also usually utilized in HOI learning since its view-independence. However, rough 3D body joints just carry sparse body information and are not sufficient to understand complex interactions. Thus, we need detailed 3D body shape to go further. Meanwhile, the interacted object in 3D is also not fully studied in HOI learning. In light of these, we propose a detailed 2D-3D joint representation learning method. First, we utilize the single-view human body capture method to obtain detailed 3D body, face and hand shapes. Next, we estimate the 3D object location and size with reference to the 2D human-object spatial configuration and object category priors. Finally, a joint learning framework and cross-modal consistency tasks are proposed to learn the joint HOI representation. To better evaluate the 2D ambiguity processing capacity of models, we propose a new benchmark named Ambiguous-HOI consisting of hard ambiguous images.

"Studying competition and market structure at the product level instead of brand level can provide firms with insights on cannibalization and product line optimization. However, it is computationally challenging to analyze product-level competition for the millions of products available on e-commerce platforms. We introduce Product2Vec, a method based on the representation learning algorithm Word2Vec, to study product-level competition, when the number of products is large. The proposed model takes shopping baskets as inputs and, for every product, generates a low-dimensional embedding that preserves important product information. In order for the product embeddings to be useful for firm strategic decision making, we leverage economic theories and causal inference to propose two modifications to Word2Vec. First of all, we create two measures, complementarity and exchangeability, that allow us to determine whether product pairs are complements or substitutes. Second, we combine these vectors with random utility-based choice models to forecast demand. To accurately estimate price elasticities, i.e., how demand responds to changes in price, we modify Word2Vec by removing the influence of price from the product vectors. We show that, compared with state-of-the-art models, our approach is faster, and can produce more accurate demand forecasts and price elasticities.",0

"Previous researches of sketches often considered sketches in pixel format and leveraged CNN based models in the sketch understanding.

"In this paper we demonstrate methods for reliable and efficient training of discrete representation using Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder models (VQ-VAEs). Discrete latent variable models have been shown to learn nontrivial representations of speech, applicable to unsupervised voice conversion and reaching state-of-the-art performance on unit discovery tasks. For unsupervised representation learning, they became viable alternatives to continuous latent variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). However, training deep discrete variable models is challenging, due to the inherent non-differentiability of the discretization operation. In this paper we focus on VQ-VAE, a state-of-the-art discrete bottleneck model shown to perform on par with its continuous counterparts. It quantizes encoder outputs with on-line $k$-means clustering. We show that the codebook learning can suffer from poor initialization and non-stationarity of clustered encoder outputs. We demonstrate that these can be successfully overcome by increasing the learning rate for the codebook and periodic date-dependent codeword re-initialization. As a result, we achieve more robust training across different tasks, and significantly increase the usage of latent codewords even for large codebooks. This has practical benefit, for instance, in unsupervised representation learning, where large codebooks may lead to disentanglement of latent representations.",0

"Extending the capabilities of robotics to real-world complex, unstructured environments requires the need of developing better perception systems while maintaining low sample complexity. When dealing with high-dimensional state spaces, current methods are either model-free or model-based based on reconstruction objectives. The sample inefficiency of the former constitutes a major barrier for applying them to the real-world. The later, while they present low sample complexity, they learn latent spaces that need to reconstruct every single detail of the scene. In real environments, the task typically just represents a small fraction of the scene. Reconstruction objectives suffer in such scenarios as they capture all the unnecessary components. In this work, we present MIRO, an information theoretic representational learning algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning. We design a latent space that maximizes the mutual information with the future information while being able to capture all the information needed for planning. We show that our approach is more robust than reconstruction objectives in the presence of distractors and cluttered scenes",0

"When observing a phenomenon, severe cases or anomalies are often characterised by deviation from the expected data distribution. However, non-deviating data samples may also implicitly lead to severe outcomes. In the case of unsupervised severe weather detection, these data samples can lead to mispredictions, since the predictors of severe weather are often not directly observed as features. We posit that incorporating external or auxiliary information, such as the outcome of an external task or an observation, can improve the decision boundaries of an unsupervised detection algorithm. In this paper, we increase the effectiveness of a clustering method to detect cases of severe weather by learning augmented and linearly separable latent representations.We evaluate our solution against three individual cases of severe weather, namely windstorms, floods and tornado outbreaks.",0

To address this challenge, we identify and target several key functionalities. First, we aim to build lasting representations and avoid catastrophic forgetting throughout the exploration process. Secondly we aim to learn a diversity of representations allowing to discover a ""diversity of diversity"" of structures (and associated skills) in complex high-dimensional environments. Thirdly, we target representations that can structure the agent discoveries in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we target the reuse of such representations to drive exploration toward an ""interesting"" type of diversity, for instance leveraging human guidance. Current approaches in state representation learning rely generally on monolithic architectures which do not enable all these functionalities. Therefore, we present a novel technique to progressively construct a Hierarchy of Observation Latent Models for Exploration Stratification, called HOLMES. This technique couples the use of a dynamic modular model architecture for representation learning with intrinsically-motivated goal exploration processes (IMGEPs). The paper shows results in the domain of automated discovery of diverse self-organized patterns, considering as testbed the experimental framework from Reinke et al. (2019).",0

"Most video person re-identification (re-ID) methods are mainly based on supervised learning, which requires cross-camera ID labeling. Since the cost of labeling increases dramatically as the number of cameras increases, it is difficult to apply the re-identification algorithm to a large camera network. In this paper, we address the scalability issue by presenting deep representation learning without ID information across multiple cameras. Technically, we train neural networks to generate both ID-discriminative and camera-invariant features. To achieve the ID discrimination ability of the embedding features, we maximize feature distances between different person IDs within a camera by using a metric learning approach. At the same time, considering each camera as a different domain, we apply adversarial learning across multiple camera domains for generating camera-invariant features. We also propose a part-aware adaptation module, which effectively performs multi-camera domain invariant feature learning in different spatial regions. We carry out comprehensive experiments on three public re-ID datasets (i.e., PRID-2011, iLIDS-VID, and MARS). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of about 20\% in terms of rank-1 accuracy on the large-scale MARS dataset.",0

"In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) bottleneck. Autoencoders (AE), and especially their convolutional variants, play a vital role in the current deep learning toolbox. Researchers and practitioners employ CAEs for a variety of tasks, ranging from outlier detection and compression to transfer and representation learning. Despite their widespread adoption, we have limited insight into how the bottleneck shape impacts the emergent properties of the CAE. We demonstrate that increased height and width of the bottleneck drastically improves generalization, which in turn leads to better performance of the latent codes in downstream transfer learning tasks. The number of channels in the bottleneck, on the other hand, is secondary in importance. Furthermore, we show empirically that, contrary to popular belief, CAEs do not learn to copy their input, even when the bottleneck has the same number of neurons as there are pixels in the input. Copying does not occur, despite training the CAE for 1,000 epochs on a tiny ($\approx$ 600 images) dataset. We believe that the findings in this paper are directly applicable and will lead to improvements in models that rely on CAEs.",0
"The focus of this paper is to undertake a comprehensive exploration of the bottleneck in convolutional autoencoders (CAEs). These autoencoders, particularly the convolutional kind, are widely used in deep learning for a range of purposes such as compression, outlier detection, and representation learning. However, the impact of the bottleneck shape on the CAE's emergent properties is not well understood. Our research indicates that a larger bottleneck size improves generalization, resulting in better performance of latent codes in downstream transfer learning tasks. We also discovered that the number of channels in the bottleneck is of secondary importance. Additionally, we challenge the conventional belief that CAEs learn to copy their input, even when the bottleneck has the same number of neurons as there are pixels in the input. Our experiments show that even after training the CAE on a small dataset for 1,000 epochs, no copying occurs. Our results have practical implications and can lead to enhancements in models that rely on CAEs.",1
"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a widely used method for graph representation learning. To elucidate the capabilities and limitations of GCNs, we investigate their power, as a function of their number of layers, to distinguish between different random graph models (corresponding to different class-conditional distributions in a classification problem) on the basis of the embeddings of their sample graphs. In particular, the graph models that we consider arise from graphons, which are the most general possible parameterizations of infinite exchangeable graph models and which are the central objects of study in the theory of dense graph limits. We give a precise characterization of the set of pairs of graphons that are indistinguishable by a GCN with nonlinear activation functions coming from a certain broad class if its depth is at least logarithmic in the size of the sample graph. This characterization is in terms of a degree profile closeness property. Outside this class, a very simple GCN architecture suffices for distinguishability. We then exhibit a concrete, infinite class of graphons arising from stochastic block models that are well-separated in terms of cut distance and are indistinguishable by a GCN. These results theoretically match empirical observations of several prior works. To prove our results, we exploit a connection to random walks on graphs. Finally, we give empirical results on synthetic and real graph classification datasets, indicating that indistinguishable graph distributions arise in practice.",0

"As many algorithms depend on a suitable representation of data, learning unique features is considered a crucial task. Although supervised techniques using deep neural networks have boosted the performance of representation learning, the need for a large set of labeled data limits the application of such methods. As an example, high-quality delineations of regions of interest in the field of pathology is a tedious and time-consuming task due to the large image dimensions. In this work, we explored the performance of a deep neural network and triplet loss in the area of representation learning. We investigated the notion of similarity and dissimilarity in pathology whole-slide images and compared different setups from unsupervised and semi-supervised to supervised learning in our experiments.

"In this paper we introduce plan2vec, an unsupervised representation learning approach that is inspired by reinforcement learning. Plan2vec constructs a weighted graph on an image dataset using near-neighbor distances, and then extrapolates this local metric to a global embedding by distilling path-integral over planned path. When applied to control, plan2vec offers a way to learn goal-conditioned value estimates that are accurate over long horizons that is both compute and sample efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of plan2vec on one simulated and two challenging real-world image datasets. Experimental results show that plan2vec successfully amortizes the planning cost, enabling reactive planning that is linear in memory and computation complexity rather than exhaustive over the entire state space.",0

"Recent single image unsupervised representation learning techniques show remarkable success on a variety of tasks. The basic principle in these works is instance discrimination: learning to differentiate between two augmented versions of the same image and a large batch of unrelated images. Networks learn to ignore the augmentation noise and extract semantically meaningful representations. Prior work uses artificial data augmentation techniques such as cropping, and color jitter which can only affect the image in superficial ways and are not aligned with how objects actually change e.g. occlusion, deformation, viewpoint change. In this paper, we argue that videos offer this natural augmentation for free. Videos can provide entirely new views of objects, show deformation, and even connect semantically similar but visually distinct concepts. We propose Video Noise Contrastive Estimation, a method for using unlabeled video to learn strong, transferable single image representations. We demonstrate improvements over recent unsupervised single image techniques, as well as over fully supervised ImageNet pretraining, across a variety of temporal and non-temporal tasks.

"Building a scalable machine learning system for unsupervised anomaly detection via representation learning is highly desirable. One of the prevalent methods is using a reconstruction error from variational autoencoder (VAE) via maximizing the evidence lower bound. We revisit VAE from the perspective of information theory to provide some theoretical foundations on using the reconstruction error, and finally arrive at a simpler and more effective model for anomaly detection. In addition, to enhance the effectiveness of detecting anomalies, we incorporate a practical model uncertainty measure into the metric.

"Transfer of pre-trained representations improves sample efficiency and simplifies hyperparameter tuning when training deep neural networks for vision. We revisit the paradigm of pre-training on large supervised datasets and fine-tuning the model on a target task. We scale up pre-training, and propose a simple recipe that we call Big Transfer (BiT). By combining a few carefully selected components, and transferring using a simple heuristic, we achieve strong performance on over 20 datasets. BiT performs well across a surprisingly wide range of data regimes -- from 1 example per class to 1M total examples. BiT achieves 87.5% top-1 accuracy on ILSVRC-2012, 99.4% on CIFAR-10, and 76.3% on the 19 task Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB).

"Mutual Information (MI) plays an important role in representation learning. However, MI is unfortunately intractable in continuous and high-dimensional settings. Recent advances establish tractable and scalable MI estimators to discover useful representation. However, most of the existing methods are not capable of providing an accurate estimation of MI with low-variance when the MI is large. We argue that directly estimating the gradients of MI is more appealing for representation learning than estimating MI in itself. To this end, we propose the Mutual Information Gradient Estimator (MIGE) for representation learning based on the score estimation of implicit distributions. MIGE exhibits a tight and smooth gradient estimation of MI in the high-dimensional and large-MI settings. We expand the applications of MIGE in both unsupervised learning of deep representations based on InfoMax and the Information Bottleneck method. Experimental results have indicated significant performance improvement in learning useful representation.",0

"Effective representation learning of electronic health records is a challenging task and is becoming more important as the availability of such data is becoming pervasive. The data contained in these records are irregular and contain multiple modalities such as notes, and medical codes. They are preempted by medical conditions the patient may have, and are typically jotted down by medical staff. Accompanying codes are notes containing valuable information about patients beyond the structured information contained in electronic health records. We use transformer networks and the recently proposed BERT language model to embed these data streams into a unified vector representation. The presented approach effectively encodes a patient's visit data into a single distributed representation, which can be used for downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates superior performance and generalization on mortality, readmission and length of stay tasks using the publicly available MIMIC-III ICU dataset.

"To solve the problem of the overwhelming size of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) several compression schemes have been proposed, one of them is teacher-student. Teacher-student tries to transfer knowledge from a complex teacher network to a simple student network. In this paper, we propose a novel method called a teacher-class network consisting of a single teacher and multiple student networks (i.e. class of students). Instead of transferring knowledge to one student only, the proposed method transfers a chunk of knowledge about the entire solution to each student. Our students are not trained for problem-specific logits, they are trained to mimic knowledge (dense representation) learned by the teacher network. Thus unlike the logits-based single student approach, the combined knowledge learned by the class of students can be used to solve other problems as well. These students can be designed to satisfy a given budget, e.g. for comparative purposes we kept the collective parameters of all the students less than or equivalent to that of a single student in the teacher-student approach . These small student networks are trained independently, making it possible to train and deploy models on memory deficient devices as well as on parallel processing systems such as data centers. The proposed teacher-class architecture is evaluated on several benchmark datasets including MNIST, FashionMNIST, IMDB Movie Reviews and CAMVid on multiple tasks including classification, sentiment classification and segmentation. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art single student approach in terms of accuracy as well as computational cost and in many cases it achieves an accuracy equivalent to the teacher network while having 10-30 times fewer parameters.",0

"Learning a good representation is an essential component for deep reinforcement learning (RL). Representation learning is especially important in multitask and partially observable settings where building a representation of the unknown environment is crucial to solve the tasks. Here we introduce Prediction of Bootstrap Latents (PBL), a simple and flexible self-supervised representation learning algorithm for multitask deep RL. PBL builds on multistep predictive representations of future observations, and focuses on capturing structured information about environment dynamics. Specifically, PBL trains its representation by predicting latent embeddings of future observations. These latent embeddings are themselves trained to be predictive of the aforementioned representations. These predictions form a bootstrapping effect, allowing the agent to learn more about the key aspects of the environment dynamics. In addition, by defining prediction tasks completely in latent space, PBL provides the flexibility of using multimodal observations involving pixel images, language instructions, rewards and more. We show in our experiments that PBL delivers across-the-board improved performance over state of the art deep RL agents in the DMLab-30 and Atari-57 multitask setting.",0

"We present a novel unsupervised feature representation learning method, Visual Commonsense Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (VC R-CNN), to serve as an improved visual region encoder for high-level tasks such as captioning and VQA. Given a set of detected object regions in an image (e.g., using Faster R-CNN), like any other unsupervised feature learning methods (e.g., word2vec), the proxy training objective of VC R-CNN is to predict the contextual objects of a region. However, they are fundamentally different: the prediction of VC R-CNN is by using causal intervention: P(Y|do(X)), while others are by using the conventional likelihood: P(Y|X). This is also the core reason why VC R-CNN can learn ""sense-making"" knowledge like chair can be sat -- while not just ""common"" co-occurrences such as chair is likely to exist if table is observed. We extensively apply VC R-CNN features in prevailing models of three popular tasks: Image Captioning, VQA, and VCR, and observe consistent performance boosts across them, achieving many new state-of-the-arts.

"Identifiability, or recovery of the true latent representations from which the observed data originates, is de facto a fundamental goal of representation learning. Yet, most deep generative models do not address the question of identifiability, and thus fail to deliver on the promise of the recovery of the true latent sources that generate the observations. Recent work proposed identifiable generative modelling using variational autoencoders (iVAE) with a theory of identifiability. Due to the intractablity of KL divergence between variational approximate posterior and the true posterior, however, iVAE has to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood, leading to suboptimal solutions in both theory and practice. In contrast, we propose an identifiable framework for estimating latent representations using a flow-based model (iFlow). Our approach directly maximizes the marginal likelihood, allowing for theoretical guarantees on identifiability, thereby dispensing with variational approximations. We derive its optimization objective in analytical form, making it possible to train iFlow in an end-to-end manner. Simulations on synthetic data validate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its practical advantages over other existing methods.",0

"Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which aims at measuring heart activities without any contact, has great potential in many applications (e.g., remote healthcare). Existing end-to-end rPPG and heart rate (HR) measurement methods from facial videos are vulnerable to the less-constrained scenarios (e.g., with head movement and bad illumination). In this letter, we explore the reason why existing end-to-end networks perform poorly in challenging conditions and establish a strong end-to-end baseline (AutoHR) for remote HR measurement with neural architecture search (NAS). The proposed method includes three parts: 1) a powerful searched backbone with novel Temporal Difference Convolution (TDC), intending to capture intrinsic rPPG-aware clues between frames; 2) a hybrid loss function considering constraints from both time and frequency domains; and 3) spatio-temporal data augmentation strategies for better representation learning. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testing.",0

"Image classification has been studied extensively, but there has been limited work in using unconventional, external guidance other than traditional image-label pairs for training. We present a set of methods for leveraging information about the semantic hierarchy embedded in class labels. We first inject label-hierarchy knowledge into an arbitrary CNN-based classifier and empirically show that availability of such external semantic information in conjunction with the visual semantics from images boosts overall performance. Taking a step further in this direction, we model more explicitly the label-label and label-image interactions using order-preserving embeddings governed by both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, prevalent in natural language, and tailor them to hierarchical image classification and representation learning. We empirically validate all the models on the hierarchical ETHEC dataset.",0

"Much of vision-and-language research focuses on a small but diverse set of independent tasks and supporting datasets often studied in isolation; however, the visually-grounded language understanding skills required for success at these tasks overlap significantly. In this work, we investigate these relationships between vision-and-language tasks by developing a large-scale, multi-task training regime. Our approach culminates in a single model on 12 datasets from four broad categories of task including visual question answering, caption-based image retrieval, grounding referring expressions, and multi-modal verification. Compared to independently trained single-task models, this represents a reduction from approximately 3 billion parameters to 270 million while simultaneously improving performance by 2.05 points on average across tasks. We use our multi-task framework to perform in-depth analysis of the effect of joint training diverse tasks. Further, we show that finetuning task-specific models from our single multi-task model can lead to further improvements, achieving performance at or above the state-of-the-art.",0

"The ability to incrementally learn new classes is crucial to the development of real-world artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we focus on a challenging but practical few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) problem. FSCIL requires CNN models to incrementally learn new classes from very few labelled samples, without forgetting the previously learned ones. To address this problem, we represent the knowledge using a neural gas (NG) network, which can learn and preserve the topology of the feature manifold formed by different classes. On this basis, we propose the TOpology-Preserving knowledge InCrementer (TOPIC) framework. TOPIC mitigates the forgetting of the old classes by stabilizing NG's topology and improves the representation learning for few-shot new classes by growing and adapting NG to new training samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets.",0

"Representation learning over graph structured data has been mostly studied in static graph settings while efforts for modeling dynamic graphs are still scant. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical variational model that introduces additional latent random variables to jointly model the hidden states of a graph recurrent neural network (GRNN) to capture both topology and node attribute changes in dynamic graphs. We argue that the use of high-level latent random variables in this variational GRNN (VGRNN) can better capture potential variability observed in dynamic graphs as well as the uncertainty of node latent representation. With semi-implicit variational inference developed for this new VGRNN architecture (SI-VGRNN), we show that flexible non-Gaussian latent representations can further help dynamic graph analytic tasks.

"In this work, we present a learning-based approach to chip placement, one of the most complex and time-consuming stages of the chip design process. Unlike prior methods, our approach has the ability to learn from past experience and improve over time. In particular, as we train over a greater number of chip blocks, our method becomes better at rapidly generating optimized placements for previously unseen chip blocks. To achieve these results, we pose placement as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem and train an agent to place the nodes of a chip netlist onto a chip canvas. To enable our RL policy to generalize to unseen blocks, we ground representation learning in the supervised task of predicting placement quality. By designing a neural architecture that can accurately predict reward across a wide variety of netlists and their placements, we are able to generate rich feature embeddings of the input netlists. We then use this architecture as the encoder of our policy and value networks to enable transfer learning. Our objective is to minimize PPA (power, performance, and area), and we show that, in under 6 hours, our method can generate placements that are superhuman or comparable on modern accelerator netlists, whereas existing baselines require human experts in the loop and take several weeks.",0

"Point cloud is a principal data structure adopted for 3D geometric information encoding. Unlike other conventional visual data, such as images and videos, these irregular points describe the complex shape features of 3D objects, which makes shape feature learning an essential component of point cloud analysis.

"The study of genetic variants can help find correlating population groups to identify cohorts that are predisposed to common diseases and explain differences in disease susceptibility and how patients react to drugs. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to identify interacting GVs to understand their complex phenotypic traits. Since the performance of a learning algorithm not only depends on the size and nature of the data but also on the quality of underlying representation, deep neural networks can learn non-linear mappings that allow transforming GVs data into more clustering and classification friendly representations than manual feature selection. In this paper, we proposed convolutional embedded networks in which we combine two DNN architectures called convolutional embedded clustering and convolutional autoencoder classifier for clustering individuals and predicting geographic ethnicity based on GVs, respectively. We employed CAE-based representation learning on 95 million GVs from the 1000 genomes and Simons genome diversity projects. Quantitative and qualitative analyses with a focus on accuracy and scalability show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as VariantSpark and ADMIXTURE. In particular, CEC can cluster targeted population groups in 22 hours with an adjusted rand index of 0.915, the normalized mutual information of 0.92, and the clustering accuracy of 89%. Contrarily, the CAE classifier can predict the geographic ethnicity of unknown samples with an F1 and Mathews correlation coefficient(MCC) score of 0.9004 and 0.8245, respectively. To provide interpretations of the predictions, we identify significant biomarkers using gradient boosted trees(GBT) and SHAP. Overall, our approach is transparent and faster than the baseline methods, and scalable for 5% to 100% of the full human genome.",0

"Grounding referring expressions in images aims to locate the object instance in an image described by a referring expression. It involves a joint understanding of natural language and image content, and is essential for a range of visual tasks related to human-computer interaction. As a language-to-vision matching task, the core of this problem is to not only extract all the necessary information (i.e., objects and the relationships among them) in both the image and referring expression, but also make full use of context information to align cross-modal semantic concepts in the extracted information. Unfortunately, existing work on grounding referring expressions fails to accurately extract multi-order relationships from the referring expression and associate them with the objects and their related contexts in the image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Relationship Extractor (CMRE) to adaptively highlight objects and relationships (spatial and semantic relations) related to the given expression with a cross-modal attention mechanism, and represent the extracted information as a language-guided visual relation graph. In addition, we propose a Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) to compute multimodal semantic contexts by fusing information from different modes and propagating multimodal information in the structured relation graph. Experimental results on three common benchmark datasets show that our Cross-Modal Relationship Inference Network, which consists of CMRE and GGCN, significantly surpasses all existing state-of-the-art methods.

"Human bodies exhibit various shapes for different identities or poses, but the body shape has certain similarities in structure and thus can be embedded in a low-dimensional space. This paper presents an autoencoder-like network architecture to learn disentangled shape and pose embedding specifically for the 3D human body.

"Recent studies show that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples which can be generated via certain types of transformations. Being robust to a desired family of adversarial attacks is then equivalent to being invariant to a family of transformations. Learning invariant representations then naturally emerges as an important goal to achieve which we explore in this paper within specific application contexts. Specifically, we propose a cyclically-trained adversarial network to learn a mapping from image space to latent representation space and back such that the latent representation is invariant to a specified factor of variation (e.g., identity). The learned mapping assures that the synthesized image is not only realistic, but has the same values for unspecified factors (e.g., pose and illumination) as the original image and a desired value of the specified factor. Unlike disentangled representation learning, which requires two latent spaces, one for specified and another for unspecified factors, invariant representation learning needs only one such space. We encourage invariance to a specified factor by applying adversarial training using a variational autoencoder in the image space as opposed to the latent space. We strengthen this invariance by introducing a cyclic training process (forward and backward cycle). We also propose a new method to evaluate conditional generative networks. It compares how well different factors of variation can be predicted from the synthesized, as opposed to real, images. In quantitative terms, our approach attains state-of-the-art performance in experiments spanning three datasets with factors such as identity, pose, illumination or style. Our method produces sharp, high-quality synthetic images with little visible artefacts compared to previous approaches.",0
"Recent research indicates that adversarial examples can compromise the integrity of deep neural networks through specific transformations. Consequently, being resistant to targeted adversarial attacks is equivalent to being unaffected by certain transformations. Therefore, it is crucial to develop invariant representations, which is the focus of this paper in the context of specific applications. We suggest a cyclically-trained adversarial network that maps image space to latent representation space and back, resulting in an invariant latent representation for a specified factor of variation. Unlike disentangled representation learning, our method only requires one latent space. We use adversarial training in the image space to encourage invariance to a specified factor and cyclic training to enhance the invariance. Additionally, we propose a new method for evaluating conditional generative networks based on how well they predict different factors of variation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, producing high-quality synthetic images with minimal visual artifacts.",1
"Most neural networks utilize the same amount of compute for every example independent of the inherent complexity of the input. Further, methods that adapt the amount of computation to the example focus on finding a fixed inference-time computational graph per example, ignoring any external computational budgets or varying inference time limitations. In this work, we utilize conditional computation to make neural sequence models (Transformer) more efficient and computation-aware during inference. We first modify the Transformer architecture, making each set of operations conditionally executable depending on the output of a learned control network. We then train this model in a multi-task setting, where each task corresponds to a particular computation budget. This allows us to train a single model that can be controlled to operate on different points of the computation-quality trade-off curve, depending on the available computation budget at inference time. We evaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) WMT English-French Translation and (ii) Unsupervised representation learning (BERT). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed Conditional Computation Transformer (CCT) is competitive with vanilla Transformers when allowed to utilize its full computational budget, while improving significantly over computationally equivalent baselines when operating on smaller computational budgets.",0

"The goal of few-shot learning is to recognize new visual concepts with just a few amount of labeled samples in each class. Recent effective metric-based few-shot approaches employ neural networks to learn a feature similarity comparison between query and support examples. However, the importance of feature embedding, i.e., exploring the relationship among training samples, is neglected. In this work, we present a simple yet powerful baseline for few-shot classification by emphasizing the importance of feature embedding. Specifically, we revisit the classical triplet network from deep metric learning, and extend it into a deep K-tuplet network for few-shot learning, utilizing the relationship among the input samples to learn a general representation learning via episode-training. Once trained, our network is able to extract discriminative features for unseen novel categories and can be seamlessly incorporated with a non-linear distance metric function to facilitate the few-shot classification.

"Adversarial perturbations are noise-like patterns that can subtly change the data, while failing an otherwise accurate classifier. In this paper, we propose to use such perturbations within a novel contrastive learning setup to build negative samples, which are then used to produce improved video representations. To this end, given a well-trained deep model for per-frame video recognition, we first generate adversarial noise adapted to this model. Positive and negative bags are produced using the original data features from the full video sequence and their perturbed counterparts, respectively. Unlike the classic contrastive learning methods, we develop a binary classification problem that learns a set of discriminative hyperplanes -- as a subspace -- that will separate the two bags from each other. This subspace is then used as a descriptor for the video, dubbed \emph{discriminative subspace pooling}. As the perturbed features belong to data classes that are likely to be confused with the original features, the discriminative subspace will characterize parts of the feature space that are more representative of the original data, and thus may provide robust video representations. To learn such descriptors, we formulate a subspace learning objective on the Stiefel manifold and resort to Riemannian optimization methods for solving it efficiently. We provide experiments on several video datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.",0

"How to utilize deep learning methods for graph classification tasks has attracted considerable research attention in the past few years. Regarding graph classification tasks, the graphs to be classified may have various graph sizes (i.e., different number of nodes and edges) and have various graph properties (e.g., average node degree, diameter, and clustering coefficient). The diverse property of graphs has imposed significant challenges on existing graph learning techniques since diverse graphs have different best-fit hyperparameters. It is difficult to learn graph features from a set of diverse graphs by a unified graph neural network. This motivates us to use a multiplex structure in a diverse way and utilize a priori properties of graphs to guide the learning. In this paper, we propose MxPool, which concurrently uses multiple graph convolution/pooling networks to build a hierarchical learning structure for graph representation learning tasks. Our experiments on numerous graph classification benchmarks show that our MxPool has superiority over other state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods.",0

"One fundamental challenge of vehicle re-identification (re-id) is to learn robust and discriminative visual representation, given the significant intra-class vehicle variations across different camera views. As the existing vehicle datasets are limited in terms of training images and viewpoints, we propose to build a unique large-scale vehicle dataset (called VehicleNet) by harnessing four public vehicle datasets, and design a simple yet effective two-stage progressive approach to learning more robust visual representation from VehicleNet. The first stage of our approach is to learn the generic representation for all domains (i.e., source vehicle datasets) by training with the conventional classification loss. This stage relaxes the full alignment between the training and testing domains, as it is agnostic to the target vehicle domain. The second stage is to fine-tune the trained model purely based on the target vehicle set, by minimizing the distribution discrepancy between our VehicleNet and any target domain. We discuss our proposed multi-source dataset VehicleNet and evaluate the effectiveness of the two-stage progressive representation learning through extensive experiments. We achieve the state-of-art accuracy of 86.07% mAP on the private test set of AICity Challenge, and competitive results on two other public vehicle re-id datasets, i.e., VeRi-776 and VehicleID. We hope this new VehicleNet dataset and the learned robust representations can pave the way for vehicle re-id in the real-world environments.",0

"Key features of mental illnesses are reflected in speech. Our research focuses on designing a multimodal deep learning structure that automatically extracts salient features from recorded speech samples for predicting various mental disorders including depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. We adopt a variety of pre-trained models to extract embeddings from both audio and text segments. We use several state-of-the-art embedding techniques including BERT, FastText, and Doc2VecC for the text representation learning and WaveNet and VGG-ish models for audio encoding. We also leverage huge auxiliary emotion-labeled text and audio corpora to train emotion-specific embeddings and use transfer learning in order to address the problem of insufficient annotated multimodal data available. All these embeddings are then combined into a joint representation in a multimodal fusion layer and finally a recurrent neural network is used to predict the mental disorder. Our results show that mental disorders can be predicted with acceptable accuracy through multimodal analysis of clinical interviews.",0

"Supervised deep learning requires a large amount of training samples with annotations (e.g. label class for classification task, pixel- or voxel-wised label map for segmentation tasks), which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. During the training of a deep neural network, the annotated samples are fed into the network in a mini-batch way, where they are often regarded of equal importance. However, some of the samples may become less informative during training, as the magnitude of the gradient start to vanish for these samples. In the meantime, other samples of higher utility or hardness may be more demanded for the training process to proceed and require more exploitation. To address the challenges of expensive annotations and loss of sample informativeness, here we propose a novel training framework which adaptively selects informative samples that are fed to the training process. The adaptive selection or sampling is performed based on a hardness-aware strategy in the latent space constructed by a generative model. To evaluate the proposed training framework, we perform experiments on three different datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10 for image classification task and a medical image dataset IVUS for biophysical simulation task. On all three datasets, the proposed framework outperforms a random sampling method, which demonstrates the effectiveness of proposed framework.",0

"Deep representation learning has become one of the most widely adopted approaches for visual search, recommendation, and identification. Retrieval of such representations from a large database is however computationally challenging. Approximate methods based on learning compact representations, have been widely explored for this problem, such as locality sensitive hashing, product quantization, and PCA. In this work, in contrast to learning compact representations, we propose to learn high dimensional and sparse representations that have similar representational capacity as dense embeddings while being more efficient due to sparse matrix multiplication operations which can be much faster than dense multiplication. Following the key insight that the number of operations decreases quadratically with the sparsity of embeddings provided the non-zero entries are distributed uniformly across dimensions, we propose a novel approach to learn such distributed sparse embeddings via the use of a carefully constructed regularization function that directly minimizes a continuous relaxation of the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) incurred during retrieval. Our experiments show that our approach is competitive to the other baselines and yields a similar or better speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff on practical datasets.",0

"This paper considers learning deep features from long-tailed data. We observe that in the deep feature space, the head classes and the tail classes present different distribution patterns. The head classes have a relatively large spatial span, while the tail classes have significantly small spatial span, due to the lack of intra-class diversity. This uneven distribution between head and tail classes distorts the overall feature space, which compromises the discriminative ability of the learned features. Intuitively, we seek to expand the distribution of the tail classes by transferring from the head classes, so as to alleviate the distortion of the feature space. To this end, we propose to construct each feature into a ""feature cloud"". If a sample belongs to a tail class, the corresponding feature cloud will have relatively large distribution range, in compensation to its lack of diversity. It allows each tail sample to push the samples from other classes far away, recovering the intra-class diversity of tail classes. Extensive experimental evaluations on person re-identification and face recognition tasks confirm the effectiveness of our method.",0
"The focus of this paper is on acquiring profound features from long-tailed data. It has been observed that the distribution patterns of head classes and tail classes differ in the deep feature space. The spatial span of head classes is relatively large, while tail classes have a significantly smaller spatial span due to the absence of intra-class diversity. This imbalance in distribution between the two sets of classes distorts the overall feature space, thereby compromising the discriminative ability of the acquired features. The idea is to extend the distribution of tail classes by transferring from head classes to reduce feature space distortion. The proposed approach involves constructing each feature into a ""feature cloud"". If a sample is from a tail class, the corresponding feature cloud will have a larger distribution range to compensate for the lack of diversity.

Our experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that such a joint approach is superior to separate treatment of unfairness in representation learning or supervised learning.

"Recent advancements in learning Discrete Representations as opposed to continuous ones have led to state of art results in tasks that involve Language, Audio and Vision. Some latent factors such as words, phonemes and shapes are better represented by discrete latent variables as opposed to continuous. Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQVAE) have produced remarkable results in multiple domains. VQVAE learns a prior distribution $z_e$ along with its mapping to a discrete number of $K$ vectors (Vector Quantization). We propose applying VQ along the feature axis. We hypothesize that by doing so, we are learning a mapping between the codebook vectors and the marginal distribution of the prior feature space. Our approach leads to 33\% improvement as compared to prevous discrete models and has similar performance to state of the art auto-regressive models (e.g. PixelSNAIL).

"We investigate the use of Minimax distances to extract in a nonparametric way the features that capture the unknown underlying patterns and structures in the data. We develop a general-purpose and computationally efficient framework to employ Minimax distances with many machine learning methods that perform on numerical data. We study both computing the pairwise Minimax distances for all pairs of objects and as well as computing the Minimax distances of all the objects to/from a fixed (test) object.   We first efficiently compute the pairwise Minimax distances between the objects, using the equivalence of Minimax distances over a graph and over a minimum spanning tree constructed on that. Then, we perform an embedding of the pairwise Minimax distances into a new vector space, such that their squared Euclidean distances in the new space equal to the pairwise Minimax distances in the original space. We also study the case of having multiple pairwise Minimax matrices, instead of a single one. Thereby, we propose an embedding via first summing up the centered matrices and then performing an eigenvalue decomposition to obtain the relevant features.   In the following, we study computing Minimax distances from a fixed (test) object which can be used for instance in K-nearest neighbor search. Similar to the case of all-pair pairwise Minimax distances, we develop an efficient and general-purpose algorithm that is applicable with any arbitrary base distance measure.

"Person re-identification (Re-ID) in real-world scenarios usually suffers from various degradation factors, e.g., low-resolution, weak illumination, blurring and adverse weather. On the one hand, these degradations lead to severe discriminative information loss, which significantly obstructs identity representation learning; on the other hand, the feature mismatch problem caused by low-level visual variations greatly reduces retrieval performance. An intuitive solution to this problem is to utilize low-level image restoration methods to improve the image quality. However, existing restoration methods cannot directly serve to real-world Re-ID due to various limitations, e.g., the requirements of reference samples, domain gap between synthesis and reality, and incompatibility between low-level and high-level methods. In this paper, to solve the above problem, we propose a degradation invariance learning framework for real-world person Re-ID. By introducing a self-supervised disentangled representation learning strategy, our method is able to simultaneously extract identity-related robust features and remove real-world degradations without extra supervision. We use low-resolution images as the main demonstration, and experiments show that our approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several Re-ID benchmarks. In addition, our framework can be easily extended to other real-world degradation factors, such as weak illumination, with only a few modifications.",0
"Re-identification of individuals in real-world situations often faces various issues that degrade the quality of the images, such as low-resolution, weak lighting, blurring, and unfavorable weather conditions.

A possible solution to this problem is to enhance image quality using low-level restoration methods.

"Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction in relational data have been designed for static data. However, the data they are applied to usually evolves with time, such as friend graphs in social networks or user interactions with items in recommender systems.

For the problem of link prediction under temporal constraints, i.e., answering queries such as (US, has president, ?, 2012), we propose a solution inspired by the canonical decomposition of tensors of order 4. We introduce new regularization schemes and present an extension of ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) that achieves state-of-the-art performance.

"We consider the problem of learning low-dimensional representations for large-scale Markov chains. We formulate the task of representation learning as that of mapping the state space of the model to a low-dimensional state space, called the kernel space. The kernel space contains a set of meta states which are desired to be representative of only a small subset of original states. To promote this structural property, we constrain the number of nonzero entries of the mappings between the state space and the kernel space. By imposing the desired characteristics of the representation, we cast the problem as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization. To compute the solution, we propose an efficient block coordinate gradient descent and theoretically analyze its convergence properties.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning holds the promise of exploiting large amounts of unlabeled data to learn general representations. A promising technique for unsupervised learning is the framework of Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs). However, unsupervised representations learned by VAEs are significantly outperformed by those learned by supervised learning for recognition. Our hypothesis is that to learn useful representations for recognition the model needs to be encouraged to learn about repeating and consistent patterns in data. Drawing inspiration from the mid-level representation discovery work, we propose PatchVAE, that reasons about images at patch level. Our key contribution is a bottleneck formulation that encourages mid-level style representations in the VAE framework. Our experiments demonstrate that representations learned by our method perform much better on the recognition tasks compared to those learned by vanilla VAEs.",0

"The cognitive framework of conceptual spaces proposes to represent concepts as regions in psychological similarity spaces. These similarity spaces are typically obtained through multidimensional scaling (MDS), which converts human dissimilarity ratings for a fixed set of stimuli into a spatial representation. One can distinguish metric MDS (which assumes that the dissimilarity ratings are interval or ratio scaled) from nonmetric MDS (which only assumes an ordinal scale). In our first study, we show that despite its additional assumptions, metric MDS does not necessarily yield better solutions than nonmetric MDS. In this chapter, we furthermore propose to learn a mapping from raw stimuli into the similarity space using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to generalize the similarity space to unseen inputs. In our second study, we show that a linear regression from the activation vectors of a convolutional ANN to similarity spaces obtained by MDS can be successful and that the results are sensitive to the number of dimensions of the similarity space.",0

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been successfully applied in several research domains such as robot navigation and automated video game playing.

"A discrete system's heterogeneity is measured by the R\'enyi heterogeneity family of indices (also known as Hill numbers or Hannah--Kay indices), whose units are {the numbers equivalent}. Unfortunately, numbers equivalent heterogeneity measures for non-categorical data require {a priori} (A) categorical partitioning and (B) pairwise distance measurement on the observable data space, thereby precluding application to problems with ill-defined categories or where semantically relevant features must be learned as abstractions from some data. We thus introduce representational R\'enyi heterogeneity (RRH), which transforms an observable domain onto a latent space upon which the R\'enyi heterogeneity is both tractable and semantically relevant. This method requires neither {a priori} binning nor definition of a distance function on the observable space. We show that RRH can generalize existing biodiversity and economic equality indices. Compared with existing indices on a beta-mixture distribution, we show that RRH responds more appropriately to changes in mixture component separation and weighting. Finally, we demonstrate the measurement of RRH in a set of natural images, with respect to abstract representations learned by a deep neural network. The RRH approach will further enable heterogeneity measurement in disciplines whose data do not easily conform to the assumptions of existing indices.",0
"The R\'enyi heterogeneity family of indices (also known as Hill numbers or Hannah-Kay indices) is used to measure the heterogeneity of a discrete system. However, non-categorical data requires categorical partitioning and pairwise distance measurement on the observable data space, making it difficult to apply to problems with ill-defined categories or where semantically relevant features must be learned as abstractions from some data. To address this issue, we propose the use of representational R\'enyi heterogeneity (RRH), which transforms the observable domain to a latent space that is both tractable and semantically relevant. This method does not require prior binning or definition of a distance function on the observable space. We demonstrate that RRH can generalize existing biodiversity and economic equality indices and responds more appropriately to changes in mixture component separation and weighting compared to existing indices on a beta-mixture distribution. Finally, we show how to measure RRH in natural images using abstract representations learned by a deep neural network. This approach will enable heterogeneity measurement in disciplines with data that do not easily conform to the assumptions of existing indices.",1
"A good clustering algorithm can discover natural groupings in data. These groupings, if used wisely, provide a form of weak supervision for learning representations. In this work, we present Clustering-based Contrastive Learning (CCL), a new clustering-based representation learning approach that uses labels obtained from clustering along with video constraints to learn discriminative face features. We demonstrate our method on the challenging task of learning representations for video face clustering. Through several ablation studies, we analyze the impact of creating pair-wise positive and negative labels from different sources. Experiments on three challenging video face clustering datasets: BBT-0101, BF-0502, and ACCIO show that CCL achieves a new state-of-the-art on all datasets.",0

"Semantic segmentation is an essential step for electron microscopy (EM) image analysis. Although supervised models have achieved significant progress, the need for labor intensive pixel-wise annotation is a major limitation. To complicate matters further, supervised learning models may not generalize well on a novel dataset due to domain shift. In this study, we introduce an adversarial-prediction guided multi-task network to learn the adaptation of a well-trained model for use on a novel unlabeled target domain. Since no label is available on target domain, we learn an encoding representation not only for the supervised segmentation on source domain but also for unsupervised reconstruction of the target data. To improve the discriminative ability with geometrical cues, we further guide the representation learning by multi-level adversarial learning in semantic prediction space. Comparisons and ablation study on public benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness of our approach.",0

"Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been an urgent problem to be solved in the face recognition systems. Conventional approaches usually assume the testing and training are within the same domain; as a result, they may not generalize well into unseen scenarios because the representations learned for PAD may overfit to the subjects in the training set. In light of this, we propose an efficient disentangled representation learning for cross-domain face PAD. Our approach consists of disentangled representation learning (DR-Net) and multi-domain learning (MD-Net). DR-Net learns a pair of encoders via generative models that can disentangle PAD informative features from subject discriminative features. The disentangled features from different domains are fed to MD-Net which learns domain-independent features for the final cross-domain face PAD task. Extensive experiments on several public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for cross-domain PAD.",0

"Although automatic gaze estimation is very important to a large variety of application areas, it is difficult to train accurate and robust gaze models, in great part due to the difficulty in collecting large and diverse data (annotating 3D gaze is expensive and existing datasets use different setups). To address this issue, our main contribution in this paper is to propose an effective approach to learn a low dimensional gaze representation without gaze annotations, which to the best of our best knowledge, is the first work to do so. The main idea is to rely on a gaze redirection network and use the gaze representation difference of the input and target images (of the redirection network) as the redirection variable. A redirection loss in image domain allows the joint training of both the redirection network and the gaze representation network. In addition, we propose a warping field regularization which not only provides an explicit physical meaning to the gaze representations but also avoids redirection distortions. Promising results on few-shot gaze estimation (competitive results can be achieved with as few as <= 100 calibration samples), cross-dataset gaze estimation, gaze network pretraining, and another task (head pose estimation) demonstrate the validity of our framework.",0

"Although Shannon theory states that it is asymptotically optimal to separate the source and channel coding as two independent processes, in many practical communication scenarios this decomposition is limited by the finite bit-length and computational power for decoding. Recently, neural joint source-channel coding (NECST) is proposed to sidestep this problem. While it leverages the advancements of amortized inference and deep learning to improve the encoding and decoding process, it still cannot always achieve compelling results in terms of compression and error correction performance due to the limited robustness of its learned coding networks. In this paper, motivated by the inherent connections between neural joint source-channel coding and discrete representation learning, we propose a novel regularization method called Infomax Adversarial-Bit-Flip (IABF) to improve the stability and robustness of the neural joint source-channel coding scheme. More specifically, on the encoder side, we propose to explicitly maximize the mutual information between the codeword and data; while on the decoder side, the amortized reconstruction is regularized within an adversarial framework. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-world datasets evidence that our IABF can achieve state-of-the-art performances on both compression and error correction benchmarks and outperform the baselines by a significant margin.",0

"In this paper, we study a new representation-learning task, which we termed as disassembling object representations. Given an image featuring multiple objects, the goal of disassembling is to acquire a latent representation, of which each part corresponds to one category of objects. Disassembling thus finds its application in a wide domain such as image editing and few- or zero-shot learning, as it enables category-specific modularity in the learned representations. To this end, we propose an unsupervised approach to achieving disassembling, named Unsupervised Disassembling Object Representation (UDOR). UDOR follows a double auto-encoder architecture, in which a fuzzy classification and an object-removing operation are imposed. The fuzzy classification constrains each part of the latent representation to encode features of up to one object category, while the object-removing, combined with a generative adversarial network, enforces the modularity of the representations and integrity of the reconstructed image. Furthermore, we devise two metrics to respectively measure the modularity of disassembled representations and the visual integrity of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UDOR, despited unsupervised, achieves truly encouraging results on par with those of supervised methods.",0

"Accurately predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTA) in silico is a key task in drug discovery. Most of the conventional DTA prediction methods are simulation-based, which rely heavily on domain knowledge or the assumption of having the 3D structure of the targets, which are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, traditional machine learning-based methods apply various features and descriptors, and simply depend on the similarities between drug-target pairs. Recently, with the increasing amount of affinity data available and the success of deep representation learning models on various domains, deep learning techniques have been applied to DTA prediction. However, these methods consider either label/one-hot encodings or the topological structure of molecules, without considering the local chemical context of amino acids and SMILES sequences. Motivated by this, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework, called DeepGS, which uses deep neural networks to extract the local chemical context from amino acids and SMILES sequences, as well as the molecular structure from the drugs. To assist the operations on the symbolic data, we propose to use advanced embedding techniques (i.e., Smi2Vec and Prot2Vec) to encode the amino acids and SMILES sequences to a distributed representation. Meanwhile, we suggest a new molecular structure modeling approach that works well under our framework. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art models including KronRLS, SimBoost, DeepDTA and DeepCPI.

"We propose an algorithm, guided variational autoencoder (Guided-VAE), that is able to learn a controllable generative model by performing latent representation disentanglement learning.

"Recent work in graph neural networks (GNNs) has led to improvements in molecular activity and property prediction tasks. Unfortunately, GNNs often fail to capture the relative importance of interactions between molecular substructures, in part due to the absence of efficient intermediate pooling steps. To address these issues, we propose LaPool (Laplacian Pooling), a novel, data-driven, and interpretable hierarchical graph pooling method that takes into account both node features and graph structure to improve molecular representation. We benchmark LaPool on molecular graph prediction and understanding tasks and show that it outperforms recent GNNs. Interestingly, LaPool also remains competitive on non-molecular tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments are done to demonstrate LaPool's improved interpretability and highlight its potential benefits in drug design.

"As humans, we inherently perceive images based on their predominant features, and ignore noise embedded within lower bit planes. On the contrary, Deep Neural Networks are known to confidently misclassify images corrupted with meticulously crafted perturbations that are nearly imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we attempt to address this problem by training networks to form coarse impressions based on the information in higher bit planes, and use the lower bit planes only to refine their prediction. We demonstrate that, by imposing consistency on the representations learned across differently quantized images, the adversarial robustness of networks improves significantly when compared to a normally trained model. Present state-of-the-art defenses against adversarial attacks require the networks to be explicitly trained using adversarial samples that are computationally expensive to generate. While such methods that use adversarial training continue to achieve the best results, this work paves the way towards achieving robustness without having to explicitly train on adversarial samples. The proposed approach is therefore faster, and also closer to the natural learning process in humans.",0
"Humans tend to focus on the main features of an image and disregard any insignificant details.

By ensuring consistency across differently quantized images, the networks become more robust against adversarial attacks without the need for expensive adversarial training. This approach is faster and more similar to the way humans learn. While adversarial training remains the most effective method, this study provides a new way to achieve robustness without explicitly using adversarial samples.",1
"In neuroscience, understanding inter-individual differences has recently emerged as a major challenge, for which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven invaluable. For this, neuroscientists rely on basic methods such as univariate linear correlations between single brain features and a score that quantifies either the severity of a disease or the subject's performance in a cognitive task. However, to this date, task-fMRI and resting-state fMRI have been exploited separately for this question, because of the lack of methods to effectively combine them. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning method which allows combining the activation-and connectivity-based information respectively measured through these two fMRI protocols to identify markers of individual differences in the functional organization of the brain. It combines a multi-view deep autoencoder which is designed to fuse the two fMRI modalities into a joint representation space within which a predictive model is trained to guess a scalar score that characterizes the patient.

"Deep learning is recognized to be capable of discovering deep features for representation learning and pattern recognition without requiring elegant feature engineering techniques by taking advantage of human ingenuity and prior knowledge. Thus it has triggered enormous research activities in machine learning and pattern recognition. One of the most important challenge of deep learning is to figure out relations between a feature and the depth of deep neural networks (deep nets for short) to reflect the necessity of depth. Our purpose is to quantify this feature-depth correspondence in feature extraction and generalization. We present the adaptivity of features to depths and vice-verse via showing a depth-parameter trade-off in extracting both single feature and composite features.

"Most object recognition approaches predominantly focus on learning discriminative visual patterns while overlooking the holistic object structure. Though important, structure modeling usually requires significant manual annotations and therefore is labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose to ""look into object"" (explicitly yet intrinsically model the object structure) through incorporating self-supervisions into the traditional framework. We show the recognition backbone can be substantially enhanced for more robust representation learning, without any cost of extra annotation and inference speed. Specifically, we first propose an object-extent learning module for localizing the object according to the visual patterns shared among the instances in the same category. We then design a spatial context learning module for modeling the internal structures of the object, through predicting the relative positions within the extent. These two modules can be easily plugged into any backbone networks during training and detached at inference time. Extensive experiments show that our look-into-object approach (LIO) achieves large performance gain on a number of benchmarks, including generic object recognition (ImageNet) and fine-grained object recognition tasks (CUB, Cars, Aircraft). We also show that this learning paradigm is highly generalizable to other tasks such as object detection and segmentation (MS COCO). Project page: https://github.com/JDAI-CV/LIO.",0

"Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image synthesis, applying trained GAN models to real image processing remains challenging. Previous methods typically invert a target image back to the latent space either by back-propagation or by learning an additional encoder. However, the reconstructions from both of the methods are far from ideal. In this work, we propose a novel approach, called mGANprior, to incorporate the well-trained GANs as effective prior to a variety of image processing tasks. In particular, we employ multiple latent codes to generate multiple feature maps at some intermediate layer of the generator, then compose them with adaptive channel importance to recover the input image. Such an over-parameterization of the latent space significantly improves the image reconstruction quality, outperforming existing competitors. The resulting high-fidelity image reconstruction enables the trained GAN models as prior to many real-world applications, such as image colorization, super-resolution, image inpainting, and semantic manipulation.

"Graph representation learning (GRL) is a powerful technique for learning low-dimensional vector representation of high-dimensional and often sparse graphs. Most studies explore the structure and metadata associated with the graph using random walks and employ an unsupervised or semi-supervised learning schemes.

Recently studies have argued on the adequacy of a single representation and proposed context-sensitive approaches, which are capable of extracting multiple node representations for different contexts. This proved to be highly effective in applications such as link prediction and ranking.   However, most of these methods rely on additional textual features that require complex and expensive RNNs or CNNs to capture high-level features or rely on a community detection algorithm to identify multiple contexts of a node.   In this study we show that in-order to extract high-quality context-sensitive node representations it is not needed to rely on supplementary node features, nor to employ computationally heavy and complex models. We propose GOAT, a context-sensitive algorithm inspired by gossip communication and a mutual attention mechanism simply over the structure of the graph. We show the efficacy of GOAT using 6 real-world datasets on link prediction and node clustering tasks and compare it against 12 popular and state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

"Network embedding is an effective method to learn low-dimensional representations of nodes, which can be applied to various real-life applications such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Although significant progress has been made on this problem in recent years, several important challenges remain, such as how to properly capture temporal information in evolving networks. In practice, most networks are continually evolving. Some networks only add new edges or nodes such as authorship networks, while others support removal of nodes or edges such as internet data routing. If patterns exist in the changes of the network structure, we can better understand the relationships between nodes and the evolution of the network, which can be further leveraged to learn node representations with more meaningful information. In this paper, we propose the Embedding via Historical Neighborhoods Aggregation (EHNA) algorithm. More specifically, we first propose a temporal random walk that can identify relevant nodes in historical neighborhoods which have impact on edge formations. Then we apply a deep learning model which uses a custom attention mechanism to induce node embeddings that directly capture temporal information in the underlying feature representation.

Although each part of an object is incomplete, the underlying attributes about the object are shared among all parts, which makes reasoning the whole object from a single part possible. We hypothesize that a powerful representation of a 3D object should model the attributes that are shared between parts and the whole object, and distinguishable from other objects. Based on this hypothesis, we propose to learn point cloud representation by bidirectional reasoning between the local structures at different abstraction hierarchies and the global shape without human supervision. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the unsupervisedly learned representation is even better than supervised representation in discriminative power, generalization ability, and robustness. We show that unsupervisedly trained point cloud models can outperform their supervised counterparts on downstream classification tasks. Most notably, by simply increasing the channel width of an SSG PointNet++, our unsupervised model surpasses the state-of-the-art supervised methods on both synthetic and real-world 3D object classification datasets. We expect our observations to offer a new perspective on learning better representation from data structures instead of human annotations for point cloud understanding.",0

"With the tremendous success of deep learning in visual tasks, the representations extracted from intermediate layers of learned models, that is, deep features, attract much attention of researchers. Previous empirical analysis shows that those features can contain appropriate semantic information. Therefore, with a model trained on a large-scale benchmark data set (e.g., ImageNet), the extracted features can work well on other tasks. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon and demonstrate that deep features can be suboptimal due to the fact that they are learned by minimizing the empirical risk. When the data distribution of the target task is different from that of the benchmark data set, the performance of deep features can degrade. Hence, we propose a hierarchically robust optimization method to learn more generic features. Considering the example-level and concept-level robustness simultaneously, we formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity set constraints, and an efficient algorithm with the conventional training pipeline is proposed. Experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust deep representations.",0

"Recent research advances in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing have introduced novel tasks that are paving the way for solving AI-complete problems. One of those tasks is called Visual Question Answering (VQA). A VQA system must take an image and a free-form, open-ended natural language question about the image, and produce a natural language answer as the output. Such a task has drawn great attention from the scientific community, which generated a plethora of approaches that aim to improve the VQA predictive accuracy. Most of them comprise three major components: (i) independent representation learning of images and questions; (ii) feature fusion so the model can use information from both sources to answer visual questions; and (iii) the generation of the correct answer in natural language. With so many approaches being recently introduced, it became unclear the real contribution of each component for the ultimate performance of the model. The main goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis regarding the impact of each component in VQA models. Our extensive set of experiments cover both visual and textual elements, as well as the combination of these representations in form of fusion and attention mechanisms. Our major contribution is to identify core components for training VQA models so as to maximize their predictive performance.",0

"Deep learning methods capable of handling relational data have proliferated over the last years. In contrast to traditional relational learning methods that leverage first-order logic for representing such data, these deep learning methods aim at re-representing symbolic relational data in Euclidean spaces. They offer better scalability, but can only numerically approximate relational structures and are less flexible in terms of reasoning tasks supported. This paper introduces a novel framework for relational representation learning that combines the best of both worlds. This framework, inspired by the auto-encoding principle, uses first-order logic as a data representation language, and the mapping between the original and latent representation is done by means of logic programs instead of neural networks. We show how learning can be cast as a constraint optimisation problem for which existing solvers can be used. The use of logic as a representation language makes the proposed framework more accurate (as the representation is exact, rather than approximate), more flexible, and more interpretable than deep learning methods. We experimentally show that these latent representations are indeed beneficial in relational learning tasks.",0

"A variety of graph neural networks (GNNs) frameworks for representation learning on graphs have been recently developed. These frameworks rely on aggregation and iteration scheme to learn the representation of nodes. However, information between nodes is inevitably lost in the scheme during learning. In order to reduce the loss, we extend the GNNs frameworks by exploring the aggregation and iteration scheme in the methodology of mutual information. We propose a new approach of enlarging the normal neighborhood in the aggregation of GNNs, which aims at maximizing mutual information.

"We present Momentum Contrast (MoCo) for unsupervised visual representation learning. From a perspective on contrastive learning as dictionary look-up, we build a dynamic dictionary with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder. This enables building a large and consistent dictionary on-the-fly that facilitates contrastive unsupervised learning. MoCo provides competitive results under the common linear protocol on ImageNet classification. More importantly, the representations learned by MoCo transfer well to downstream tasks. MoCo can outperform its supervised pre-training counterpart in 7 detection/segmentation tasks on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and other datasets, sometimes surpassing it by large margins.

"Low-rank Multi-view Subspace Learning (LMvSL) has shown great potential in cross-view classification in recent years. Despite their empirical success, existing LMvSL based methods are incapable of well handling view discrepancy and discriminancy simultaneously, which thus leads to the performance degradation when there is a large discrepancy among multi-view data. To circumvent this drawback, motivated by the block-diagonal representation learning, we propose Structured Low-rank Matrix Recovery (SLMR), a unique method of effectively removing view discrepancy and improving discriminancy through the recovery of structured low-rank matrix. Furthermore, recent low-rank modeling provides a satisfactory solution to address data contaminated by predefined assumptions of noise distribution, such as Gaussian or Laplacian distribution. However, these models are not practical since complicated noise in practice may violate those assumptions and the distribution is generally unknown in advance. To alleviate such limitation, modal regression is elegantly incorporated into the framework of SLMR (term it MR-SLMR). Different from previous LMvSL based methods, our MR-SLMR can handle any zero-mode noise variable that contains a wide range of noise, such as Gaussian noise, random noise and outliers. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework and half-quadratic theory are used to efficiently optimize MR-SLMR. Experimental results on four public databases demonstrate the superiority of MR-SLMR and its robustness to complicated noise.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning via generative modeling is a staple to many computer vision applications in the absence of labeled data. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that learn representations useful for data generation. However, due to inherent challenges in the training objective, VAEs fail to learn useful representations amenable for downstream tasks. Regularization-based methods that attempt to improve the representation learning aspect of VAEs come at a price: poor sample generation. In this paper, we explore this representation-generation trade-off for regularized VAEs and introduce a new family of priors, namely decoupled priors, or dpVAEs, that decouple the representation space from the generation space. This decoupling enables the use of VAE regularizers on the representation space without impacting the distribution used for sample generation, and thereby reaping the representation learning benefits of the regularizations without sacrificing the sample generation. dpVAE leverages invertible networks to learn a bijective mapping from an arbitrarily complex representation distribution to a simple, tractable, generative distribution. Decoupled priors can be adapted to the state-of-the-art VAE regularizers without additional hyperparameter tuning. We showcase the use of dpVAEs with different regularizers. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA demonstrate, quantitatively and qualitatively, that dpVAE fixes sample generation for regularized VAEs.",0

"Person re-identification (reID) aims to match person images to retrieve the ones with the same identity. This is a challenging task, as the images to be matched are generally semantically misaligned due to the diversity of human poses and capture viewpoints, incompleteness of the visible bodies (due to occlusion), etc. In this paper, we propose a framework that drives the reID network to learn semantics-aligned feature representation through delicate supervision designs. Specifically, we build a Semantics Aligning Network (SAN) which consists of a base network as encoder (SA-Enc) for re-ID, and a decoder (SA-Dec) for reconstructing/regressing the densely semantics aligned full texture image. We jointly train the SAN under the supervisions of person re-identification and aligned texture generation. Moreover, at the decoder, besides the reconstruction loss, we add Triplet ReID constraints over the feature maps as the perceptual losses. The decoder is discarded in the inference and thus our scheme is computationally efficient. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. We achieve the state-of-the-art performances on the benchmark datasets CUHK03, Market1501, MSMT17, and the partial person reID dataset Partial REID.

"Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to recognize instances of the same person contained in multiple images taken across different cameras. Existing methods for re-ID tend to rely heavily on the assumption that both query and gallery images of the same person have the same clothing. Unfortunately, this assumption may not hold for datasets captured over long periods of time (e.g., weeks, months or years). To tackle the re-ID problem in the context of clothing changes, we propose a novel representation learning model which is able to generate a body shape feature representation without being affected by clothing color or patterns. We call our model the Color Agnostic Shape Extraction Network (CASE-Net). CASE-Net learns a representation of identity that depends only on body shape via adversarial learning and feature disentanglement. Due to the lack of large-scale re-ID datasets which contain clothing changes for the same person, we propose two synthetic datasets for evaluation. We create a rendered dataset SMPL-reID with different clothes patterns and a synthesized dataset Div-Market with different clothing color to simulate two types of clothing changes.

"The ability to decompose complex multi-object scenes into meaningful abstractions like objects is fundamental to achieve higher-level cognition. Previous approaches for unsupervised object-oriented scene representation learning are either based on spatial-attention or scene-mixture approaches and limited in scalability which is a main obstacle towards modeling real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose a generative latent variable model, called SPACE, that provides a unified probabilistic modeling framework that combines the best of spatial-attention and scene-mixture approaches. SPACE can explicitly provide factorized object representations for foreground objects while also decomposing background segments of complex morphology. Previous models are good at either of these, but not both. SPACE also resolves the scalability problems of previous methods by incorporating parallel spatial-attention and thus is applicable to scenes with a large number of objects without performance degradations. We show through experiments on Atari and 3D-Rooms that SPACE achieves the above properties consistently in comparison to SPAIR, IODINE, and GENESIS.

"Video anomaly detection is of critical practical importance to a variety of real applications because it allows human attention to be focused on events that are likely to be of interest, in spite of an otherwise overwhelming volume of video.

"The vast majority of visual animals actively control their eyes, heads, and/or bodies to direct their gaze toward different parts of their environment. In contrast, recent applications of reinforcement learning in robotic manipulation employ cameras as passive sensors. These are carefully placed to view a scene from a fixed pose. Active perception allows animals to gather the most relevant information about the world and focus their computational resources where needed. It also enables them to view objects from different distances and viewpoints, providing a rich visual experience from which to learn abstract representations of the environment. Inspired by the primate visual-motor system, we present a framework that leverages the benefits of active perception to accomplish manipulation tasks. Our agent uses viewpoint changes to localize objects, to learn state representations in a self-supervised manner, and to perform goal-directed actions. We apply our model to a simulated grasping task with a 6-DoF action space. Compared to its passive, fixed-camera counterpart, the active model achieves 8% better performance in targeted grasping.

"Recently, a number of competitive methods have tackled unsupervised representation learning by maximising the mutual information between the representations produced from augmentations. The resulting representations are then invariant to stochastic augmentation strategies, and can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering or classification. Yet data augmentations preserve many properties of an image and so there is potential for a suboptimal choice of representation that relies on matching easy-to-find features in the data. We demonstrate that greedy or local methods of maximising mutual information (such as stochastic gradient optimisation) discover local optima of the mutual information criterion; the resulting representations are also less-ideally suited to complex downstream tasks. Earlier work has not specifically identified or addressed this issue. We introduce deep hierarchical object grouping (DHOG) that computes a number of distinct discrete representations of images in a hierarchical order, eventually generating representations that better optimise the mutual information objective. We also find that these representations align better with the downstream task of grouping into underlying object classes. We tested DHOG on unsupervised clustering, which is a natural downstream test as the target representation is a discrete labelling of the data. We achieved new state-of-the-art results on the three main benchmarks without any prefiltering or Sobel-edge detection that proved necessary for many previous methods to work.

"High-resolution representations are essential for position-sensitive vision problems, such as human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Existing state-of-the-art frameworks first encode the input image as a low-resolution representation through a subnetwork that is formed by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions \emph{in series} (e.g., ResNet, VGGNet), and then recover the high-resolution representation from the encoded low-resolution representation. Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams \emph{in parallel}; (ii) Repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

"For vision problems that require accurate positioning, such as human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, high-resolution representations are crucial. The current state-of-the-art frameworks use a subnetwork that connects high-to-low resolution convolutions in series, like ResNet and VGGNet, to encode the input image as a low-resolution representation before recovering the high-resolution representation. In contrast, our proposed High-Resolution Network (HRNet) maintains high-resolution representations throughout the process. This is achieved by connecting the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel and repeatedly exchanging information across resolutions. The resulting representation is more semantically rich and spatially precise, which makes HRNet a stronger backbone for computer vision problems. We demonstrate the superiority of HRNet in various applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection.

"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning require a large amount of training data and generally result in representations that are often over specialized to the target task. In this work, we present a methodology to study the underlying potential causes for this specialization. We use the recently proposed projection weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) to measure the similarity of visual representations learned in the same environment by performing different tasks.   We then leverage our proposed methodology to examine the task dependence of visual representations learned on related but distinct embodied navigation tasks. Surprisingly, we find that slight differences in task have no measurable effect on the visual representation for both SqueezeNet and ResNet architectures. We then empirically demonstrate that visual representations learned on one task can be effectively transferred to a different task.",0
"The need for vast amounts of training data and the tendency towards specialized representations are challenges faced by modern deep reinforcement learning techniques. In this study, we introduce a methodology aimed at investigating the underlying factors that contribute to such specialization. We employ the projection weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) to determine the similarity of visual representations learned from different tasks in the same environment. Our methodology enables us to scrutinize the task-specific nature of visual representations created for related but distinct navigation tasks. To our surprise, our analysis reveals that even slight differences in the task have no significant impact on the visual representation of SqueezeNet and ResNet architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical evidence that visual representations learned for one task can be effectively utilized for a completely different task.",1
"Bottom-up human pose estimation methods have difficulties in predicting the correct pose for small persons due to challenges in scale variation. In this paper, we present HigherHRNet: a novel bottom-up human pose estimation method for learning scale-aware representations using high-resolution feature pyramids. Equipped with multi-resolution supervision for training and multi-resolution aggregation for inference, the proposed approach is able to solve the scale variation challenge in bottom-up multi-person pose estimation and localize keypoints more precisely, especially for small person. The feature pyramid in HigherHRNet consists of feature map outputs from HRNet and upsampled higher-resolution outputs through a transposed convolution. HigherHRNet outperforms the previous best bottom-up method by 2.5% AP for medium person on COCO test-dev, showing its effectiveness in handling scale variation. Furthermore, HigherHRNet achieves new state-of-the-art result on COCO test-dev (70.5% AP) without using refinement or other post-processing techniques, surpassing all existing bottom-up methods. HigherHRNet even surpasses all top-down methods on CrowdPose test (67.6% AP), suggesting its robustness in crowded scene. The code and models are available at https://github.com/HRNet/Higher-HRNet-Human-Pose-Estimation.",0
