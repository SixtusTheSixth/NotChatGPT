"Approximating optimal policies in reinforcement learning (RL) is often necessary in many real-world scenarios, which is termed as policy optimization. By viewing the reinforcement learning from the perspective of variational inference (VI), the policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions given the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the policy optimization may lead to suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient exploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate policy optimization with HMC. As such we choose evolving actions from the base policy according to HMC, which has two benefits: i) HMC can improve the policy distribution to better approximate the posterior and hence reduces the amortization gap; ii) HMC can also guide the exploration more to the regions with higher action values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Instead of directly applying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics. With comprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a data-efficient, and an easy-to-implement improvement over previous policy optimization methods. Besides, the proposed approach can also outperform previous methods on DeepMind Control Suite which has image-based high-dimensional observation space.",0

"We prove that a single-layer neural network trained with the Q-learning algorithm converges in distribution to a random ordinary differential equation as the size of the model and the number of training steps become large. Analysis of the limit differential equation shows that it has a unique stationary solution which is the solution of the Bellman equation, thus giving the optimal control for the problem. In addition, we study the convergence of the limit differential equation to the stationary solution. As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain the limiting behavior of single-layer neural networks when trained on i.i.d. data with stochastic gradient descent under the widely-used Xavier initialization.",0

"This paper addresses distributional offline continuous-time reinforcement learning (DOCTR-L) with stochastic policies for high-dimensional optimal control. A soft distributional version of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is given by a semilinear partial differential equation (PDE). This `soft HJB equation' can be learned from offline data without assuming that the latter correspond to a previous optimal or near-optimal policy. A data-driven solution of the soft HJB equation uses methods of Neural PDEs and Physics-Informed Neural Networks developed in the field of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). The suggested approach, dubbed `SciPhy RL', thus reduces DOCTR-L to solving neural PDEs from data. Our algorithm called Deep DOCTR-L converts offline high-dimensional data into an optimal policy in one step by reducing it to supervised learning, instead of relying on value iteration or policy iteration methods. The method enables a computable approach to the quality control of obtained policies in terms of both their expected returns and uncertainties about their values.",0

"Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) can restore motion to a paralysed person's muscles. Yet, control stimulating many muscles to restore the practical function of entire limbs is an unsolved problem. Current neurostimulation engineering still relies on 20th Century control approaches and correspondingly shows only modest results that require daily tinkering to operate at all.

"Cone Beam Computed Tomography(CBCT) is a now known method to conduct CT imaging. Especially, The Low Dose CT imaging is one of possible options to protect organs of patients when conducting CT imaging.

"The difficulty of optimal control problems has classically been characterized in terms of system properties such as minimum eigenvalues of controllability/observability gramians. We revisit these characterizations in the context of the increasing popularity of data-driven techniques like reinforcement learning (RL), and in control settings where input observations are high-dimensional images and transition dynamics are unknown. Specifically, we ask: to what extent are quantifiable control and perceptual difficulty metrics of a task predictive of the performance and sample complexity of data-driven controllers? We modulate two different types of partial observability in a cartpole ""stick-balancing"" problem -- (i) the height of one visible fixation point on the cartpole, which can be used to tune fundamental limits of performance achievable by any controller, and by (ii) the level of perception noise in the fixation point position inferred from depth or RGB images of the cartpole.

"Accurate estimation of 3D human motion from monocular video requires modeling both kinematics (body motion without physical forces) and dynamics (motion with physical forces). To demonstrate this, we present SimPoE, a Simulation-based approach for 3D human Pose Estimation, which integrates image-based kinematic inference and physics-based dynamics modeling. SimPoE learns a policy that takes as input the current-frame pose estimate and the next image frame to control a physically-simulated character to output the next-frame pose estimate. The policy contains a learnable kinematic pose refinement unit that uses 2D keypoints to iteratively refine its kinematic pose estimate of the next frame. Based on this refined kinematic pose, the policy learns to compute dynamics-based control (e.g., joint torques) of the character to advance the current-frame pose estimate to the pose estimate of the next frame. This design couples the kinematic pose refinement unit with the dynamics-based control generation unit, which are learned jointly with reinforcement learning to achieve accurate and physically-plausible pose estimation. Furthermore, we propose a meta-control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the character's dynamics parameters based on the character state to attain more accurate pose estimates. Experiments on large-scale motion datasets demonstrate that our approach establishes the new state of the art in pose accuracy while ensuring physical plausibility.",0

"Model-free or learning-based control, in particular, reinforcement learning (RL), is expected to be applied for complex robotic tasks. Traditional RL requires a policy to be optimized is state-dependent, that means, the policy is a kind of feedback (FB) controllers. Due to the necessity of correct state observation in such a FB controller, it is sensitive to sensing failures. To alleviate this drawback of the FB controllers, feedback error learning integrates one of them with a feedforward (FF) controller. RL can be improved by dealing with the FB/FF policies, but to the best of our knowledge, a methodology for learning them in a unified manner has not been developed. In this paper, we propose a new optimization problem for optimizing both the FB/FF policies simultaneously. Inspired by control as inference, the optimization problem considers minimization/maximization of divergences between trajectory, predicted by the composed policy and a stochastic dynamics model, and optimal/non-optimal trajectories. By approximating the stochastic dynamics model using variational method, we naturally derive a regularization between the FB/FF policies. In numerical simulations and a robot experiment, we verified that the proposed method can stably optimize the composed policy even with the different learning law from the traditional RL. In addition, we demonstrated that the FF policy is robust to the sensing failures and can hold the optimal motion. Attached video is also uploaded on youtube: https://youtu.be/zLL4uXIRmrE",0
"The use of model-free or learning-based control, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), is anticipated to be implemented for intricate robotic tasks. The conventional RL relies on a state-dependent policy optimization, which essentially functions as feedback (FB) controllers. However, because of the requirement for accurate observation of the state in FB controllers, they are susceptible to sensing failures. Feedback error learning has been incorporated to mitigate this limitation by combining a FB controller with a feedforward (FF) controller. Although the FB/FF policies can enhance RL, a unified approach to learning them has yet to be established. In this study, we introduce a novel optimization problem that simultaneously optimizes both the FB/FF policies. Drawing inspiration from control as inference, our optimization problem minimizes/maximizes the divergences between the predicted trajectory generated by the combined policy and a stochastic dynamics model, and the optimal/non-optimal trajectories. By approximating the stochastic dynamics model using variational methods, we can naturally regulate the FB/FF policies. In numerical simulations and a robot experiment, we demonstrate that our approach can stably optimize the combined policy, even with a different learning methodology from traditional RL.

"In imitation learning from observation IfO, a learning agent seeks to imitate a demonstrating agent using only observations of the demonstrated behavior without access to the control signals generated by the demonstrator. Recent methods based on adversarial imitation learning have led to state-of-the-art performance on IfO problems, but they typically suffer from high sample complexity due to a reliance on data-inefficient, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. This issue makes them impractical to deploy in real-world settings, where gathering samples can incur high costs in terms of time, energy, and risk. In this work, we hypothesize that we can incorporate ideas from model-based reinforcement learning with adversarial methods for IfO in order to increase the data efficiency of these methods without sacrificing performance. Specifically, we consider time-varying linear Gaussian policies, and propose a method that integrates the linear-quadratic regulator with path integral policy improvement into an existing adversarial IfO framework. The result is a more data-efficient IfO algorithm with better performance, which we show empirically in four simulation domains: using far fewer interactions with the environment, the proposed method exhibits similar or better performance than the existing technique.",0

"Simulation environments are good for learning different driving tasks like lane changing, parking or handling intersections etc. in an abstract manner. However, these simulation environments often restrict themselves to operate under conservative interactions behavior amongst different vehicles.

"In this work, we study the problem of energy-efficient computation offloading enabled by edge computing. In the considered scenario, multiple users simultaneously compete for limited radio and edge computing resources to get offloaded tasks processed under a delay constraint, with the possibility of exploiting low power sleep modes at all network nodes. The radio resource allocation takes into account inter- and intra-cell interference, and the duty cycles of the radio and computing equipment have to be jointly optimized to minimize the overall energy consumption. To address this issue, we formulate the underlying problem as a dynamic long-term optimization. Then, based on Lyapunov stochastic optimization tools, we decouple the formulated problem into a CPU scheduling problem and a radio resource allocation problem to be solved in a per-slot basis. Whereas the first one can be optimally and efficiently solved using a fast iterative algorithm, the second one is solved using distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning due to its non-convexity and NP-hardness.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is attracting attention as an effective way to solve sequential optimization problems that involve high dimensional state/action space and stochastic uncertainties. Many such problems involve constraints expressed by inequality constraints. This study focuses on using RL to solve constrained optimal control problems. Most RL application studies have dealt with inequality constraints by adding soft penalty terms for violating the constraints to the reward function. However, while training neural networks to learn the value (or Q) function, one can run into computational issues caused by the sharp change in the function value at the constraint boundary due to the large penalty imposed. This difficulty during training can lead to convergence problems and ultimately lead to poor closed-loop performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a dynamic penalty (DP) approach where the penalty factor is gradually and systematically increased during training as the iteration episodes proceed. We first examine the ability of a neural network to represent a value function when uniform, linear, or DP functions are added to prevent constraint violation. The agent trained by a Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm with the DP function approach was compared with agents with other constant penalty functions in a simple vehicle control problem. Results show that the proposed approach can improve the neural network approximation accuracy and provide faster convergence when close to a solution.",0

"In this work we propose and analyze a new framework to learn feedback control policies that exhibit provable guarantees on the closed-loop performance and robustness to bounded (adversarial) perturbations. These policies are learned from expert demonstrations without any prior knowledge of the task, its cost function, and system dynamics. In contrast to the existing algorithms in imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning, we use a Lipschitz-constrained loss minimization scheme to learn control policies with certified robustness. We establish robust stability of the closed-loop system under the learned control policy and derive an upper bound on its regret, which bounds the sub-optimality of the closed-loop performance with respect to the expert policy. We also derive a robustness bound for the deterioration of the closed-loop performance under bounded (adversarial) perturbations on the state measurements. Ultimately, our results suggest the existence of an underlying tradeoff between nominal closed-loop performance and adversarial robustness, and that improvements in nominal closed-loop performance can only be made at the expense of robustness to adversarial perturbations. Numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our robust feedback policy learning framework.",0

"Building interpretable parameterizations of real-world decision-making on the basis of demonstrated behavior -- i.e. trajectories of observations and actions made by an expert maximizing some unknown reward function -- is essential for introspecting and auditing policies in different institutions. In this paper, we propose learning explanations of expert decisions by modeling their reward function in terms of preferences with respect to ""what if"" outcomes: Given the current history of observations, what would happen if we took a particular action? To learn these cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with the expert's actions, we integrate counterfactual reasoning into batch inverse reinforcement learning. This offers a principled way of defining reward functions and explaining expert behavior, and also satisfies the constraints of real-world decision-making -- where active experimentation is often impossible (e.g. in healthcare). Additionally, by estimating the effects of different actions, counterfactuals readily tackle the off-policy nature of policy evaluation in the batch setting, and can naturally accommodate settings where the expert policies depend on histories of observations rather than just current states. Through illustrative experiments in both real and simulated medical environments, we highlight the effectiveness of our batch, counterfactual inverse reinforcement learning approach in recovering accurate and interpretable descriptions of behavior.",0

We achieve this by integrating counterfactual reasoning into batch inverse reinforcement learning. This method allows us to define reward functions and explain expert behavior in a systematic way that adheres to the constraints of real-world decision-making, where active experimentation is often impossible, such as in healthcare. Additionally, counterfactuals can handle the off-policy nature of policy evaluation in the batch setting and can adapt to situations where expert policies depend on observation histories rather than just current states. We present illustrative experiments in both real and simulated medical environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recovering accurate and easy-to-understand descriptions of behavior.",1
"Greedy-GQ is a value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimal control. Recently, the finite-time analysis of Greedy-GQ has been developed under linear function approximation and Markovian sampling, and the algorithm is shown to achieve an $\epsilon$-stationary point with a sample complexity in the order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. Such a high sample complexity is due to the large variance induced by the Markovian samples. In this paper, we propose a variance-reduced Greedy-GQ (VR-Greedy-GQ) algorithm for off-policy optimal control. In particular, the algorithm applies the SVRG-based variance reduction scheme to reduce the stochastic variance of the two time-scale updates. We study the finite-time convergence of VR-Greedy-GQ under linear function approximation and Markovian sampling and show that the algorithm achieves a much smaller bias and variance error than the original Greedy-GQ. In particular, we prove that VR-Greedy-GQ achieves an improved sample complexity that is in the order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. We further compare the performance of VR-Greedy-GQ with that of Greedy-GQ in various RL experiments to corroborate our theoretical findings.",0

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently achieved significant advances in various domains. However, explaining the policy of RL agents still remains an open problem due to several factors, one being the complexity of explaining neural networks decisions. Recently, a group of works have used decision-tree-based models to learn explainable policies. Soft decision trees (SDTs) and discretized differentiable decision trees (DDTs) have been demonstrated to achieve both good performance and share the benefit of having explainable policies. In this work, we further improve the results for tree-based explainable RL in both performance and explainability. Our proposal, Cascading Decision Trees (CDTs) apply representation learning on the decision path to allow richer expressivity. Empirical results show that in both situations, where CDTs are used as policy function approximators or as imitation learners to explain black-box policies, CDTs can achieve better performances with more succinct and explainable models than SDTs. As a second contribution our study reveals limitations of explaining black-box policies via imitation learning with tree-based explainable models, due to its inherent instability.",0
"Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has made significant strides in various areas, there remains an unresolved issue of explaining the policies of RL agents.

"We present a novel two-layer hierarchical reinforcement learning approach equipped with a Goals Relational Graph (GRG) for tackling the partially observable goal-driven task, such as goal-driven visual navigation. Our GRG captures the underlying relations of all goals in the goal space through a Dirichlet-categorical process that facilitates: 1) the high-level network raising a sub-goal towards achieving a designated final goal; 2) the low-level network towards an optimal policy; and 3) the overall system generalizing unseen environments and goals. We evaluate our approach with two settings of partially observable goal-driven tasks -- a grid-world domain and a robotic object search task. Our experimental results show that our approach exhibits superior generalization performance on both unseen environments and new goals.",0

"By planning through a learned dynamics model, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers the prospect of good performance with little environment interaction. However, it is common in practice for the learned model to be inaccurate, impairing planning and leading to poor performance. This paper aims to improve planning with an importance sampling framework that accounts and corrects for discrepancy between the true and learned dynamics. This framework also motivates an alternative objective for fitting the dynamics model: to minimize the variance of value estimation during planning. We derive and implement this objective, which encourages better prediction on trajectories with larger returns. We observe empirically that our approach improves the performance of current MBRL algorithms on two stochastic control problems, and provide a theoretical basis for our method.",0

By implementing this objective, the model can better predict trajectories with larger returns. Empirical observations demonstrate that this approach enhances the performance of current MBRL algorithms on two stochastic control problems, and the method is supported by theoretical evidence.",1
"Effective planning in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model-predictive control (MPC) relies on the accuracy of the learned dynamics model. In many instances of MBRL and MPC, this model is assumed to be stationary and is periodically re-trained from scratch on state transition experience collected from the beginning of environment interactions. This implies that the time required to train the dynamics model - and the pause required between plan executions - grows linearly with the size of the collected experience. We argue that this is too slow for lifelong robot learning and propose HyperCRL, a method that continually learns the encountered dynamics in a sequence of tasks using task-conditional hypernetworks. Our method has three main attributes: first, it includes dynamics learning sessions that do not revisit training data from previous tasks, so it only needs to store the most recent fixed-size portion of the state transition experience; second, it uses fixed-capacity hypernetworks to represent non-stationary and task-aware dynamics; third, it outperforms existing continual learning alternatives that rely on fixed-capacity networks, and does competitively with baselines that remember an ever increasing coreset of past experience. We show that HyperCRL is effective in continual model-based reinforcement learning in robot locomotion and manipulation scenarios, such as tasks involving pushing and door opening.

"Thanks to the rapid growth in wearable technologies, monitoring complex human context becomes feasible, paving the way to develop human-in-the-loop IoT systems that naturally evolve to adapt to the human and environment state autonomously. Nevertheless, a central challenge in designing such personalized IoT applications arises from human variability. Such variability stems from the fact that different humans exhibit different behaviors when interacting with IoT applications (intra-human variability), the same human may change the behavior over time when interacting with the same IoT application (inter-human variability), and human behavior may be affected by the behaviors of other people in the same environment (multi-human variability). To that end, we propose FaiR-IoT, a general reinforcement learning-based framework for adaptive and fairness-aware human-in-the-loop IoT applications. In FaiR-IoT, three levels of reinforcement learning agents interact to continuously learn human preferences and maximize the system's performance and fairness while taking into account the intra-, inter-, and multi-human variability. We validate the proposed framework on two applications, namely (i) Human-in-the-Loop Automotive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and (ii) Human-in-the-Loop Smart House. Results obtained on these two applications validate the generality of FaiR-IoT and its ability to provide a personalized experience while enhancing the system's performance by 40%-60% compared to non-personalized systems and enhancing the fairness of the multi-human systems by 1.5 orders of magnitude.",0

"The inputs and preferences of human users are important considerations in situations where these users interact with autonomous cyber or cyber-physical systems. In these scenarios, one is often interested in aligning behaviors of the system with the preferences of one or more human users. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is a paradigm that has been empirically shown to model a tendency of humans to view gains and losses differently. In this paper, we consider a setting where an autonomous agent has to learn behaviors in an unknown environment. In traditional reinforcement learning, these behaviors are learned through repeated interactions with the environment by optimizing an expected utility. In order to endow the agent with the ability to closely mimic the behavior of human users, we optimize a CPT-based cost. We introduce the notion of the CPT-value of an action taken in a state, and establish the convergence of an iterative dynamic programming-based approach to estimate this quantity. We develop two algorithms to enable agents to learn policies to optimize the CPT-vale, and evaluate these algorithms in environments where a target state has to be reached while avoiding obstacles. We demonstrate that behaviors of the agent learned using these algorithms are better aligned with that of a human user who might be placed in the same environment, and is significantly improved over a baseline that optimizes an expected utility.",0

"Multi-agent reinforcement learning involves multiple agents interacting with each other and a shared environment to complete tasks. When rewards provided by the environment are sparse, agents may not receive immediate feedback on the quality of actions that they take, thereby affecting learning of policies. In this paper, we propose a method called Shaping Advice in deep Multi-agent reinforcement learning (SAM) to augment the reward signal from the environment with an additional reward termed shaping advice. The shaping advice is given by a difference of potential functions at consecutive time-steps. Each potential function is a function of observations and actions of the agents. The shaping advice needs to be specified only once at the start of training, and can be easily provided by non-experts. We show through theoretical analyses and experimental validation that shaping advice provided by SAM does not distract agents from completing tasks specified by the environment reward. Theoretically, we prove that convergence of policy gradients and value functions when using SAM implies convergence of these quantities in the absence of SAM. Experimentally, we evaluate SAM on three tasks in the multi-agent Particle World environment that have sparse rewards. We observe that using SAM results in agents learning policies to complete tasks faster, and obtain higher rewards than: i) using sparse rewards alone; ii) a state-of-the-art reward redistribution method.",0
"The process of multi-agent reinforcement learning involves multiple agents collaborating within a shared environment to accomplish tasks. However, in situations where the environment provides minimal rewards, agents may struggle to receive immediate feedback on their actions, which can negatively impact their policy learning. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Shaping Advice in deep Multi-agent reinforcement learning (SAM). SAM enhances the reward signal from the environment by adding an extra reward known as shaping advice, which is obtained from the difference of potential functions between consecutive time-steps. These potential functions are based on the agents' actions and observations. SAM requires only one-time specification of the shaping advice, which can be effortlessly provided by non-experts. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and experimentation that SAM's shaping advice does not hinder agents from completing tasks set by the environment reward. Our theoretical analysis shows that the convergence of policy gradients and value functions using SAM implies convergence of these quantities even without SAM. In our experiments, we evaluate SAM on three tasks within the multi-agent Particle World environment, which have sparse rewards. Our results indicate that SAM enables agents to learn policies faster and achieve higher rewards compared to using sparse rewards alone or a state-of-the-art reward redistribution method.",1
"Machine learning models are often trained on data from one distribution and deployed on others. So it becomes important to design models that are robust to distribution shifts. Most of the existing work focuses on optimizing for either adversarial shifts or interventional shifts. Adversarial methods lack expressivity in representing plausible shifts as they consider shifts to joint distributions in the data. Interventional methods allow more expressivity but provide robustness to unbounded shifts, resulting in overly conservative models. In this work, we combine the complementary strengths of the two approaches and propose a new formulation, RISe, for designing robust models against a set of distribution shifts that are at the intersection of adversarial and interventional shifts. We employ the distributionally robust optimization framework to optimize the resulting objective in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and real world datasets from healthcare demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",0

"Assigning resources in business processes execution is a repetitive task that can be effectively automated. However, different automation methods may give varying results that may not be optimal. Proper resource allocation is crucial as it may lead to significant cost reductions or increased effectiveness that results in increased revenues.   In this work, we first propose a novel representation that allows modeling of a multi-process environment with different process-based rewards. These processes can share resources that differ in their eligibility. Then, we use double deep reinforcement learning to look for optimal resource allocation policy. We compare those results with two popular strategies that are widely used in the industry. Learning optimal policy through reinforcement learning requires frequent interactions with the environment, so we also designed and developed a simulation engine that can mimic real-world processes.   The results obtained are promising. Deep reinforcement learning based resource allocation achieved significantly better results compared to two commonly used techniques.",0

"In this paper, we explore a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to address the design problem of communication and control strategies for multi-agent cooperative transport. Typical end-to-end deep neural network policies may be insufficient for covering communication and control; these methods cannot decide the timing of communication and can only work with fixed-rate communications. Therefore, our framework exploits event-triggered architecture, namely, a feedback controller that computes the communication input and a triggering mechanism that determines when the input has to be updated again. Such event-triggered control policies are efficiently optimized using a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient. We confirmed that our approach could balance the transport performance and communication savings through numerical simulations.",0

Therefore, our proposed framework utilizes an event-triggered architecture, which consists of a feedback controller that computes the communication input and a triggering mechanism that decides when the input needs updating. These event-triggered control policies are effectively optimized using a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient.

"Point cloud registration is a common step in many 3D computer vision tasks such as object pose estimation, where a 3D model is aligned to an observation. Classical registration methods generalize well to novel domains but fail when given a noisy observation or a bad initialization. Learning-based methods, in contrast, are more robust but lack in generalization capacity. We propose to consider iterative point cloud registration as a reinforcement learning task and, to this end, present a novel registration agent (ReAgent). We employ imitation learning to initialize its discrete registration policy based on a steady expert policy. Integration with policy optimization, based on our proposed alignment reward, further improves the agent's registration performance. We compare our approach to classical and learning-based registration methods on both ModelNet40 (synthetic) and ScanObjectNN (real data) and show that our ReAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The lightweight architecture of the agent, moreover, enables reduced inference time as compared to related approaches.

"Modern data sources are typically of large scale and multi-modal natures, and acquired on irregular domains, which poses serious challenges to traditional deep learning models. These issues are partially mitigated by either extending existing deep learning algorithms to irregular domains through graphs, or by employing tensor methods to alleviate the computational bottlenecks imposed by the Curse of Dimensionality. To simultaneously resolve both these issues, we introduce a novel Multi-Graph Tensor Network (MGTN) framework, which leverages on the desirable properties of graphs, tensors and neural networks in a physically meaningful and compact manner. This equips MGTNs with the ability to exploit local information in irregular data sources at a drastically reduced parameter complexity, and over a range of learning paradigms such as regression, classification and reinforcement learning. The benefits of the MGTN framework, especially its ability to avoid overfitting through the inherent low-rank regularization properties of tensor networks, are demonstrated through its superior performance against competing models in the individual tensor, graph, and neural network domains.",0

"An increasing amount of studies have investigated the decision-making process of VQA models. Many of these studies focus on the reason behind the correct answer chosen by a model. Yet, the reason why the distracting answer chose by a model has rarely been studied. To this end, we introduce a novel task called \textit{textual Distractors Generation for VQA} (DG-VQA) that explaining the decision boundaries of existing VQA models. The goal of DG-VQA is to generate the most confusing set of textual distractors in multi-choice VQA tasks which expose the vulnerability of existing models (i.e. to generate distractors that lure existing models to fail). We show that DG-VQA can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process, and present a reinforcement learning solution to come up with distractors in an unsupervised manner. The solution addresses the lack of large annotated corpus issues in previous distractor generation methods. Our proposed model receives reward signals from fully-trained multi-choice VQA models and updates its parameters via policy gradient. The empirical results show that the generated textual distractors can successfully attack several popular VQA models with an average $20\%$ accuracy drop from $64\%$. Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training to improve the robustness of VQA models by incorporating the generated distractors. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of adversarial training by showing a performance improvement of $27\%$ for the multi-choice VQA task.",0

"Imitation learning is a primary approach to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning by exploiting the expert demonstrations. However, in many real scenarios, obtaining expert demonstrations could be extremely expensive or even impossible. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called Co-Imitation Learning (CoIL) to exploit the past good experiences of the agents themselves without expert demonstration. Specifically, we train two different agents via letting each of them alternately explore the environment and exploit the peer agent's experience. While the experiences could be valuable or misleading, we propose to estimate the potential utility of each piece of experience with the expected gain of the value function. Thus the agents can selectively imitate from each other by emphasizing the more useful experiences while filtering out noisy ones. Experimental results on various tasks show significant superiority of the proposed Co-Imitation Learning framework, validating that the agents can benefit from each other without external supervision.",0

"Driving in a dynamic, multi-agent, and complex urban environment is a difficult task requiring a complex decision-making policy. The learning of such a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional, limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of other agents and the ego car. We also propose a hazard signal in addition to the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model. In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baseline methods.",0

"Deep regression trackers are among the fastest tracking algorithms available, and therefore suitable for real-time robotic applications. However, their accuracy is inadequate in many domains due to distribution shift and overfitting. In this paper we overcome such limitations by presenting the first methodology for domain adaption of such a class of trackers. To reduce the labeling effort we propose a weakly-supervised adaptation strategy, in which reinforcement learning is used to express weak supervision as a scalar application-dependent and temporally-delayed feedback. At the same time, knowledge distillation is employed to guarantee learning stability and to compress and transfer knowledge from more powerful but slower trackers. Extensive experiments on five different robotic vision domains demonstrate the relevance of our methodology. Real-time speed is achieved on embedded devices and on machines without GPUs, while accuracy reaches significant results.",0

"The visuomotor system of any animal is critical for its survival, and the development of a complex one within humans is large factor in our success as a species on Earth. This system is an essential part of our ability to adapt to our environment. We use this system continuously throughout the day, when picking something up, or walking around while avoiding bumping into objects. Equipping robots with such capabilities will help produce more intelligent locomotion with the ability to more easily understand their surroundings and to move safely. In particular, such capabilities are desirable for traversing the lunar surface, as it is full of hazardous obstacles, such as rocks. These obstacles need to be identified and avoided in real time. This paper seeks to demonstrate the development of a visuomotor system within a robot for navigation and obstacle avoidance, with complex rock shaped objects representing hazards. Our approach uses deep reinforcement learning with only image data. In this paper, we compare the results from several neural network architectures and a preprocessing methodology which includes producing a segmented image and downsampling.",0

"We propose a selective learning method using meta-learning and deep reinforcement learning for medical image interpretation in the setting of limited labeling resources. Our method, MedSelect, consists of a trainable deep learning selector that uses image embeddings obtained from contrastive pretraining for determining which images to label, and a non-parametric selector that uses cosine similarity to classify unseen images. We demonstrate that MedSelect learns an effective selection strategy outperforming baseline selection strategies across seen and unseen medical conditions for chest X-ray interpretation. We also perform an analysis of the selections performed by MedSelect comparing the distribution of latent embeddings and clinical features, and find significant differences compared to the strongest performing baseline.

"A fundamental problem in computer animation is that of realizing purposeful and realistic human movement given a sufficiently-rich set of motion capture clips. We learn data-driven generative models of human movement using autoregressive conditional variational autoencoders, or Motion VAEs.

"Learning from demonstrations has made great progress over the past few years. However, it is generally data hungry and task specific. In other words, it requires a large amount of data to train a decent model on a particular task, and the model often fails to generalize to new tasks that have a different distribution. In practice, demonstrations from new tasks will be continuously observed and the data might be unlabeled or only partially labeled. Therefore, it is desirable for the trained model to adapt to new tasks that have limited data samples available. In this work, we build an adaptable imitation learning model based on the integration of Meta-learning and Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Meta-AIRL). We exploit the adversarial learning and inverse reinforcement learning mechanisms to learn policies and reward functions simultaneously from available training tasks and then adapt them to new tasks with the meta-learning framework. Simulation results show that the adapted policy trained with Meta-AIRL can effectively learn from limited number of demonstrations, and quickly reach the performance comparable to that of the experts on unseen tasks.",0

"Meta-learning is a branch of machine learning which aims to quickly adapt models, such as neural networks, to perform new tasks by learning an underlying structure across related tasks. In essence, models are being trained to learn new tasks effectively rather than master a single task. Meta-learning is appealing for process control applications because the perturbations to a process required to train an AI controller can be costly and unsafe. Additionally, the dynamics and control objectives are similar across many different processes, so it is feasible to create a generalizable controller through meta-learning capable of quickly adapting to different systems. In this work, we construct a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based controller and meta-train the controller using a latent context variable through a separate embedding neural network. We test our meta-algorithm on its ability to adapt to new process dynamics as well as different control objectives on the same process. In both cases, our meta-learning algorithm adapts very quickly to new tasks, outperforming a regular DRL controller trained from scratch.

"Conventional anti-jamming method mostly rely on frequency hopping to hide or escape from jammer. These approaches are not efficient in terms of bandwidth usage and can also result in a high probability of jamming. Different from existing works, in this paper, a novel anti-jamming strategy is proposed based on the idea of deceiving the jammer into attacking a victim channel while maintaining the communications of legitimate users in safe channels. Since the jammer's channel information is not known to the users, an optimal channel selection scheme and a sub optimal power allocation are proposed using reinforcement learning (RL). The performance of the proposed anti-jamming technique is evaluated by deriving the statistical lower bound of the total received power (TRP). Analytical results show that, for a given access point, over 50 % of the highest achievable TRP, i.e. in the absence of jammers, is achieved for the case of a single user and three frequency channels. Moreover, this value increases with the number of users and available channels. The obtained results are compared with two existing RL based anti-jamming techniques, and random channel allocation strategy without any jamming attacks. Simulation results show that the proposed anti-jamming method outperforms the compared RL based anti-jamming methods and random search method, and yields near optimal achievable TRP.",0

"This paper considers batch Reinforcement Learning (RL) with general value function approximation. Our study investigates the minimal assumptions to reliably estimate/minimize Bellman error, and characterizes the generalization performance by (local) Rademacher complexities of general function classes, which makes initial steps in bridging the gap between statistical learning theory and batch RL. Concretely, we view the Bellman error as a surrogate loss for the optimality gap, and prove the followings: (1) In double sampling regime, the excess risk of Empirical Risk Minimizer (ERM) is bounded by the Rademacher complexity of the function class. (2) In the single sampling regime, sample-efficient risk minimization is not possible without further assumptions, regardless of algorithms. However, with completeness assumptions, the excess risk of FQI and a minimax style algorithm can be again bounded by the Rademacher complexity of the corresponding function classes.

"A collective flashing ratchet transports Brownian particles using a spatially periodic, asymmetric, and time-dependent on-off switchable potential. The net current of the particles in this system can be substantially increased by feedback control based on the particle positions. Several feedback policies for maximizing the current have been proposed, but optimal policies have not been found for a moderate number of particles. Here, we use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to find optimal policies, with results showing that policies built with a suitable neural network architecture outperform the previous policies.

"In the wake of the highly electrified future ahead of us, the role of energy storage is crucial wherever distributed generation is abundant, such as in microgrid settings. Given the variety of storage options that are becoming more and more economical, determining which type of storage technology to invest in, along with the appropriate timing and capacity becomes a critical research question. It is inevitable that these problems will continue to become increasingly relevant in the future and require strategic planning and holistic and modern frameworks in order to be solved. Reinforcement Learning algorithms have already proven to be successful in problems where sequential decision-making is inherent. In the operations planning area, these algorithms are already used but mostly in short-term problems with well-defined constraints. On the contrary, we expand and tailor these techniques to long-term planning by utilizing model-free algorithms combined with simulation-based models. A model and expansion plan have been developed to optimally determine microgrid designs as they evolve to dynamically react to changing conditions and to exploit energy storage capabilities. We show that it is possible to derive better engineering solutions that would point to the types of energy storage units which could be at the core of future microgrid applications. Another key finding is that the optimal storage capacity threshold for a system depends heavily on the price movements of the available storage units. By utilizing the proposed approaches, it is possible to model inherent problem uncertainties and optimize the whole streamline of sequential investment decision-making.",0

"We study the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem in which an agent has to reach a goal state in minimum total expected cost. In the learning formulation of the problem, the agent has no prior knowledge about the costs and dynamics of the model. She repeatedly interacts with the model for $K$ episodes, and has to learn to approximate the optimal policy as closely as possible. In this work we show that the minimax regret for this setting is $\widetilde O(B_\star \sqrt{|S| |A| K})$ where $B_\star$ is a bound on the expected cost of the optimal policy from any state, $S$ is the state space, and $A$ is the action space. This matches the lower bound of Rosenberg et al. (2020) up to logarithmic factors, and improves their regret bound by a factor of $\sqrt{|S|}$. Our algorithm runs in polynomial-time per episode, and is based on a novel reduction to reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs. To that end, we provide an algorithm for the finite-horizon setting whose leading term in the regret depends only logarithmically on the horizon, yielding the same regret guarantees for SSP.",0
"The Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem is the focus of our study, where an agent aims to minimize the overall expected cost in reaching a goal state.

"The paper considers a distributed version of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-agent decision-making process in the paradigm of federated learning. Since the deep neural network models in federated learning are trained locally and aggregated iteratively through a central server, frequent information exchange incurs a large amount of communication overheads. Besides, due to the heterogeneity of agents, Markov state transition trajectories from different agents are usually unsynchronized within the same time interval, which will further influence the convergence bound of the aggregated deep neural network models. Therefore, it is of vital importance to reasonably evaluate the effectiveness of different optimization methods. Accordingly, this paper proposes a utility function to consider the balance between reducing communication overheads and improving convergence performance. Meanwhile, this paper develops two new optimization methods on top of variation-aware periodic averaging methods: 1) the decay-based method which gradually decreases the weight of the model's local gradients within the progress of local updating, and 2) the consensus-based method which introduces the consensus algorithm into federated learning for the exchange of the model's local gradients. This paper also provides novel convergence guarantees for both developed methods and demonstrates their effectiveness and efficiency through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results.",0

"A fundamental question in the theory of reinforcement learning is: suppose the optimal $Q$-function lies in the linear span of a given $d$ dimensional feature mapping, is sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) possible? The recent and remarkable result of Weisz et al. (2020) resolved this question in the negative, providing an exponential (in $d$) sample size lower bound, which holds even if the agent has access to a generative model of the environment. One may hope that this information theoretic barrier for RL can be circumvented by further supposing an even more favorable assumption: there exists a \emph{constant suboptimality gap} between the optimal $Q$-value of the best action and that of the second-best action (for all states). The hope is that having a large suboptimality gap would permit easier identification of optimal actions themselves, thus making the problem tractable; indeed, provided the agent has access to a generative model, sample-efficient RL is in fact possible with the addition of this more favorable assumption.   This work focuses on this question in the standard online reinforcement learning setting, where our main result resolves this question in the negative: our hardness result shows that an exponential sample complexity lower bound still holds even if a constant suboptimality gap is assumed in addition to having a linearly realizable optimal $Q$-function. Perhaps surprisingly, this implies an exponential separation between the online RL setting and the generative model setting. Complementing our negative hardness result, we give two positive results showing that provably sample-efficient RL is possible either under an additional low-variance assumption or under a novel hypercontractivity assumption (both implicitly place stronger conditions on the underlying dynamics model).",0
"The theory of reinforcement learning poses a significant question regarding the possibility of sample-efficient RL when the optimal $Q$-function can be found within the linear span of a given $d$ dimensional feature mapping. However, the recent study by Weisz et al.

To overcome this barrier, one may assume the existence of a constant suboptimality gap between the optimal $Q$-value of the best action and that of the second-best action for all states. This assumption could potentially make the problem tractable by facilitating the identification of optimal actions. Sample-efficient RL is possible with this assumption and access to a generative model.

"In the standard Markov decision process formalism, users specify tasks by writing down a reward function. However, in many scenarios, the user is unable to describe the task in words or numbers, but can readily provide examples of what the world would look like if the task were solved. Motivated by this observation, we derive a control algorithm from first principles that aims to visit states that have a high probability of leading to successful outcomes, given only examples of successful outcome states. Prior work has approached similar problem settings in a two-stage process, first learning an auxiliary reward function and then optimizing this reward function using another reinforcement learning algorithm. In contrast, we derive a method based on recursive classification that eschews auxiliary reward functions and instead directly learns a value function from transitions and successful outcomes. Our method therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines of code to debug. We show that our method satisfies a new data-driven Bellman equation, where examples take the place of the typical reward function term. Experiments show that our approach outperforms prior methods that learn explicit reward functions.",0

"DQN (Deep Q-Network) is a method to perform Q-learning for reinforcement learning using deep neural networks. DQNs require a large buffer and batch processing for an experience replay and rely on a backpropagation based iterative optimization, making them difficult to be implemented on resource-limited edge devices.

To address this, we propose a lightweight on-device reinforcement learning approach that utilizes a neural-network based training algorithm called OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine) and a combination of L2 regularization and spectral normalization to stabilize the reinforcement learning process. Our approach is designed for low-cost FPGA devices, specifically the PYNQ-Z1 board. Evaluation results using OpenAI Gym show that our approach completes a CartPole-v0 task significantly faster than a conventional DQN-based approach (29.77x and 89.40x faster when the number of hidden-layer nodes is 64).",1
"Autonomous navigation in crowded, complex urban environments requires interacting with other agents on the road. A common solution to this problem is to use a prediction model to guess the likely future actions of other agents. While this is reasonable, it leads to overly conservative plans because it does not explicitly model the mutual influence of the actions of interacting agents. This paper builds a reinforcement learning-based method named MIDAS where an ego-agent learns to affect the control actions of other cars in urban driving scenarios. MIDAS uses an attention-mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of other agents and includes a ""driver-type"" parameter to learn a single policy that works across different planning objectives. We build a simulation environment that enables diverse interaction experiments with a large number of agents and methods for quantitatively studying the safety, efficiency, and interaction among vehicles. MIDAS is validated using extensive experiments and we show that it (i) can work across different road geometries, (ii) results in an adaptive ego policy that can be tuned easily to satisfy performance criteria such as aggressive or cautious driving, (iii) is robust to changes in the driving policies of external agents, and (iv) is more efficient and safer than existing approaches to interaction-aware decision-making.",0

"Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) maintains the entire probability distribution of the reward-to-go, i.e. the return, providing more learning signals that account for the uncertainty associated with policy performance, which may be beneficial for trading off exploration and exploitation and policy learning in general. Previous works in distributional RL focused mainly on computing the state-action-return distributions, here we model the state-return distributions. This enables us to translate successful conventional RL algorithms that are based on state values into distributional RL. We formulate the distributional Bellman operation as an inference-based auto-encoding process that minimises Wasserstein metrics between target/model return distributions. The proposed algorithm, BDPG (Bayesian Distributional Policy Gradients), uses adversarial training in joint-contrastive learning to estimate a variational posterior from the returns. Moreover, we can now interpret the return prediction uncertainty as an information gain, which allows to obtain a new curiosity measure that helps BDPG steer exploration actively and efficiently. We demonstrate in a suite of Atari 2600 games and MuJoCo tasks, including well known hard-exploration challenges, how BDPG learns generally faster and with higher asymptotic performance than reference distributional RL algorithms.",0

"We propose a novel information bottleneck (IB) method named Drop-Bottleneck, which discretely drops features that are irrelevant to the target variable. Drop-Bottleneck not only enjoys a simple and tractable compression objective but also additionally provides a deterministic compressed representation of the input variable, which is useful for inference tasks that require consistent representation. Moreover, it can jointly learn a feature extractor and select features considering each feature dimension's relevance to the target task, which is unattainable by most neural network-based IB methods. We propose an exploration method based on Drop-Bottleneck for reinforcement learning tasks. In a multitude of noisy and reward sparse maze navigation tasks in VizDoom (Kempka et al., 2016) and DMLab (Beattie et al., 2016), our exploration method achieves state-of-the-art performance. As a new IB framework, we demonstrate that Drop-Bottleneck outperforms Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) (Alemi et al., 2017) in multiple aspects including adversarial robustness and dimensionality reduction.",0

"The options framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning has increased its popularity in recent years and has made improvements in tackling the scalability problem in reinforcement learning. Yet, most of these recent successes are linked with a proper options initialization or discovery. When an expert is available, the options discovery problem can be addressed by learning an options-type hierarchical policy directly from expert demonstrations. This problem is referred to as hierarchical imitation learning and can be handled as an inference problem in a Hidden Markov Model, which is done via an Expectation-Maximization type algorithm. In this work, we propose a novel online algorithm to perform hierarchical imitation learning in the options framework. Further, we discuss the benefits of such an algorithm and compare it with its batch version in classical reinforcement learning benchmarks.

"Offline (or batch) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms seek to learn an optimal policy from a fixed dataset without active data collection. Based on the composition of the offline dataset, two main categories of methods are used: imitation learning which is suitable for expert datasets and vanilla offline RL which often requires uniform coverage datasets. From a practical standpoint, datasets often deviate from these two extremes and the exact data composition is usually unknown a priori. To bridge this gap, we present a new offline RL framework that smoothly interpolates between the two extremes of data composition, hence unifying imitation learning and vanilla offline RL. The new framework is centered around a weak version of the concentrability coefficient that measures the deviation from the behavior policy to the expert policy alone.   Under this new framework, we further investigate the question on algorithm design: can one develop an algorithm that achieves a minimax optimal rate and also adapts to unknown data composition? To address this question, we consider a lower confidence bound (LCB) algorithm developed based on pessimism in the face of uncertainty in offline RL. We study finite-sample properties of LCB as well as information-theoretic limits in multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our analysis reveals surprising facts about optimality rates. In particular, in all three settings, LCB achieves a faster rate of $1/N$ for nearly-expert datasets compared to the usual rate of $1/\sqrt{N}$ in offline RL, where $N$ is the number of samples in the batch dataset. In the case of contextual bandits with at least two contexts, we prove that LCB is adaptively optimal for the entire data composition range, achieving a smooth transition from imitation learning to offline RL. We further show that LCB is almost adaptively optimal in MDPs.",0

"Recently, autonomous driving has made substantial progress in addressing the most common traffic scenarios like intersection navigation and lane changing. However, most of these successes have been limited to scenarios with well-defined traffic rules and require minimal negotiation with other vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a previously unconsidered, yet everyday, high-conflict driving scenario requiring negotiations between agents of equal rights and priorities. There exists no centralized control structure and we do not allow communications. Therefore, it is unknown if other drivers are willing to cooperate, and if so to what extent. We train policies to robustly negotiate with opposing vehicles of an unobservable degree of cooperativeness using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose Discrete Asymmetric Soft Actor-Critic (DASAC), a maximum-entropy off-policy MARL algorithm allowing for centralized training with decentralized execution. We show that using DASAC we are able to successfully negotiate and traverse the scenario considered over 99% of the time. Our agents are robust to an unknown timing of opponent decisions, an unobservable degree of cooperativeness of the opposing vehicle, and previously unencountered policies. Furthermore, they learn to exhibit human-like behaviors such as defensive driving, anticipating solution options and interpreting the behavior of other agents.",0

"We consider the problem of knowledge transfer when an agent is facing a series of Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. We introduce a novel metric between Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and establish that close MDPs have close optimal value functions. Formally, the optimal value functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the tasks space. These theoretical results lead us to a value-transfer method for Lifelong RL, which we use to build a PAC-MDP algorithm with improved convergence rate.

"A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning to safety-critical domains is understanding how to balance exploration (needed to attain good performance on the task) with safety (needed to avoid catastrophic failure). Although a growing line of work in reinforcement learning has investigated this area of ""safe exploration,"" most existing techniques either 1) do not guarantee safety during the actual exploration process; and/or 2) limit the problem to a priori known and/or deterministic transition dynamics with strong smoothness assumptions. Addressing this gap, we propose Analogous Safe-state Exploration (ASE), an algorithm for provably safe exploration in MDPs with unknown, stochastic dynamics. Our method exploits analogies between state-action pairs to safely learn a near-optimal policy in a PAC-MDP sense.

"Current value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods optimize individual Q values to guide individuals' behaviours via centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). However, such expected, i.e., risk-neutral, Q value is not sufficient even with CTDE due to the randomness of rewards and the uncertainty in environments, which causes the failure of these methods to train coordinating agents in complex environments. To address these issues, we propose RMIX, a novel cooperative MARL method with the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) measure over the learned distributions of individuals' Q values. Specifically, we first learn the return distributions of individuals to analytically calculate CVaR for decentralized execution. Then, to handle the temporal nature of the stochastic outcomes during executions, we propose a dynamic risk level predictor for risk level tuning. Finally, we optimize the CVaR policies with CVaR values used to estimate the target in TD error during centralized training and the CVaR values are used as auxiliary local rewards to update the local distribution via Quantile Regression loss. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging StarCraft II tasks, demonstrating enhanced coordination and improved sample efficiency.",0

"Policy optimization methods remain a powerful workhorse in empirical Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a focus on neural policies that can easily reason over complex and continuous state and/or action spaces. Theoretical understanding of strategic exploration in policy-based methods with non-linear function approximation, however, is largely missing. In this paper, we address this question by designing ENIAC, an actor-critic method that allows non-linear function approximation in the critic. We show that under certain assumptions, e.g., a bounded eluder dimension $d$ for the critic class, the learner finds a near-optimal policy in $O(\poly(d))$ exploration rounds. The method is robust to model misspecification and strictly extends existing works on linear function approximation. We also develop some computational optimizations of our approach with slightly worse statistical guarantees and an empirical adaptation building on existing deep RL tools. We empirically evaluate this adaptation and show that it outperforms prior heuristics inspired by linear methods, establishing the value via correctly reasoning about the agent's uncertainty under non-linear function approximation.",0

"To improve the system performance towards the Shannon limit, advanced radio resource management mechanisms play a fundamental role. In particular, scheduling should receive much attention, because it allocates radio resources among different users in terms of their channel conditions and QoS requirements. The difficulties of scheduling algorithms are the tradeoffs need to be made among multiple objectives, such as throughput, fairness and packet drop rate. We propose a smart scheduling scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We not only verify the performance gain achieved, but also provide implementation-friend designs, i.e., a scalable neural network design for the agent and a virtual environment training framework. With the scalable neural network design, the DRL agent can easily handle the cases when the number of active users is time-varying without the need to redesign and retrain the DRL agent. Training the DRL agent in a virtual environment offline first and using it as the initial version in the practical usage helps to prevent the system from suffering from performance and robustness degradation due to the time-consuming training. Through both simulations and field tests, we show that the DRL-based smart scheduling outperforms the conventional scheduling method and can be adopted in practical systems.",0

"Deep learning has shown great promise for CT image reconstruction, in particular to enable low dose imaging and integrated diagnostics. These merits, however, stand at great odds with the low availability of diverse image data which are needed to train these neural networks.

"Projecting high-dimensional environment observations into lower-dimensional structured representations can considerably improve data-efficiency for reinforcement learning in domains with limited data such as robotics. Can a single generally useful representation be found? In order to answer this question, it is important to understand how the representation will be used by the agent and what properties such a 'good' representation should have. In this paper we systematically evaluate a number of common learnt and hand-engineered representations in the context of three robotics tasks: lifting, stacking and pushing of 3D blocks. The representations are evaluated in two use-cases: as input to the agent, or as a source of auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, the value of each representation is evaluated in terms of three properties: dimensionality, observability and disentanglement. We can significantly improve performance in both use-cases and demonstrate that some representations can perform commensurate to simulator states as agent inputs. Finally, our results challenge common intuitions by demonstrating that: 1) dimensionality strongly matters for task generation, but is negligible for inputs, 2) observability of task-relevant aspects mostly affects the input representation use-case, and 3) disentanglement leads to better auxiliary tasks, but has only limited benefits for input representations. This work serves as a step towards a more systematic understanding of what makes a 'good' representation for control in robotics, enabling practitioners to make more informed choices for developing new learned or hand-engineered representations.",0

"Data augmentation (DA) plays a critical role in training deep neural networks for improving the generalization of models. Recent work has shown that automatic DA policy, such as AutoAugment (AA), significantly improves model performance. However, most automatic DA methods search for DA policies at the image-level without considering that the optimal policies for different regions in an image may be diverse. In this paper, we propose a patch-level automatic DA algorithm called Patch AutoAugment (PAA). PAA divides an image into a grid of patches and searches for the optimal DA policy of each patch. Specifically, PAA allows each patch DA operation to be controlled by an agent and models it as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. At each step, PAA samples the most effective operation for each patch based on its content and the semantics of the whole image. The agents cooperate as a team and share a unified team reward for achieving the joint optimal DA policy of the whole image. The experiment shows that PAA consistently improves the target network performance on many benchmark datasets of image classification and fine-grained image recognition. PAA also achieves remarkable computational efficiency, i.e 2.3x faster than FastAA and 56.1x faster than AA on ImageNet.",0

"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is quickly becoming the standard methodology to design neural network models. However, NAS is typically compute-intensive because multiple models need to be evaluated before choosing the best one. To reduce the computational power and time needed, a proxy task is often used for evaluating each model instead of full training. In this paper, we evaluate conventional reduced-training proxies and quantify how well they preserve ranking between multiple models during search when compared with the rankings produced by final trained accuracy. We propose a series of zero-cost proxies, based on recent pruning literature, that use just a single minibatch of training data to compute a model's score. Our zero-cost proxies use 3 orders of magnitude less computation but can match and even outperform conventional proxies. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between final validation accuracy and our best zero-cost proxy on NAS-Bench-201 is 0.82, compared to 0.61 for EcoNAS (a recently proposed reduced-training proxy). Finally, we use these zero-cost proxies to enhance existing NAS search algorithms such as random search, reinforcement learning, evolutionary search and predictor-based search. For all search methodologies and across three different NAS datasets, we are able to significantly improve sample efficiency, and thereby decrease computation, by using our zero-cost proxies. For example on NAS-Bench-101, we achieved the same accuracy 4$\times$ quicker than the best previous result. Our code is made public at: https://github.com/mohsaied/zero-cost-nas.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently led to many breakthroughs on a range of complex control tasks. However, the agent's decision-making process is generally not transparent. The lack of interpretability hinders the applicability of RL in safety-critical scenarios. While several methods have attempted to interpret vision-based RL, most come without detailed explanation for the agent's behavior. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised interpretable framework, which can discover interpretable features to enable easy understanding of RL agents even for non-experts. Specifically, a self-supervised interpretable network (SSINet) is employed to produce fine-grained attention masks for highlighting task-relevant information, which constitutes most evidence for the agent's decisions. We verify and evaluate our method on several Atari 2600 games as well as Duckietown, which is a challenging self-driving car simulator environment. The results show that our method renders empirical evidences about how the agent makes decisions and why the agent performs well or badly, especially when transferred to novel scenes. Overall, our method provides valuable insight into the internal decision-making process of vision-based RL. In addition, our method does not use any external labelled data, and thus demonstrates the possibility to learn high-quality mask through a self-supervised manner, which may shed light on new paradigms for label-free vision learning such as self-supervised segmentation and detection.",0

"Purpose: Image classification may be the fundamental task in imaging artificial intelligence. We have recently shown that reinforcement learning can achieve high accuracy for lesion localization and segmentation even with minuscule training sets. Here, we introduce reinforcement learning for image classification. In particular, we apply the approach to normal vs. tumor-containing 2D MRI brain images.   Materials and Methods: We applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep Q learning and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 30 images (15 normal and 15 tumor-containing). We tested on a separate set of 30 images (15 normal and 15 tumor-containing). For comparison, we also trained and tested a supervised deep-learning classification network on the same set of training and testing images.   Results: Whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data and as expected performed poorly on the testing set (57% accuracy, just over random guessing), the reinforcement learning approach achieved an accuracy of 100%.   Conclusion: We have shown a proof-of-principle application of reinforcement learning to the classification of brain tumors. We achieved perfect testing set accuracy with a training set of merely 30 images.",0
"The main objective of imaging artificial intelligence is image classification, which is crucial. It has been demonstrated that reinforcement learning can achieve high accuracy for lesion localization and segmentation with small training sets.

"Purpose: Lesion segmentation in medical imaging is key to evaluating treatment response. We have recently shown that reinforcement learning can be applied to radiological images for lesion localization. Furthermore, we demonstrated that reinforcement learning addresses important limitations of supervised deep learning; namely, it can eliminate the requirement for large amounts of annotated training data and can provide valuable intuition lacking in supervised approaches. However, we did not address the fundamental task of lesion/structure-of-interest segmentation. Here we introduce a method combining unsupervised deep learning clustering with reinforcement learning to segment brain lesions on MRI.   Materials and Methods: We initially clustered images using unsupervised deep learning clustering to generate candidate lesion masks for each MRI image. The user then selected the best mask for each of 10 training images. We then trained a reinforcement learning algorithm to select the masks. We tested the corresponding trained deep Q network on a separate testing set of 10 images. For comparison, we also trained and tested a U-net supervised deep learning network on the same set of training/testing images.   Results: Whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data and predictably performed poorly on the testing set (16% average Dice score), the unsupervised deep clustering and reinforcement learning achieved an average Dice score of 83%.   Conclusion: We have demonstrated a proof-of-principle application of unsupervised deep clustering and reinforcement learning to segment brain tumors. The approach represents human-allied AI that requires minimal input from the radiologist without the need for hand-traced annotation.",0

"Purpose Supervised deep learning in radiology suffers from notorious inherent limitations: 1) It requires large, hand-annotated data sets, 2) It is non-generalizable, and 3) It lacks explainability and intuition. We have recently proposed Reinforcement Learning to address all threes. However, we applied it to images with radiologist eye tracking points, which limits the state-action space. Here we generalize the Deep-Q Learning to a gridworld-based environment, so that only the images and image masks are required.   Materials and Methods We trained a Deep Q network on 30 two-dimensional image slices from the BraTS brain tumor database. Each image contained one lesion. We then tested the trained Deep Q network on a separate set of 30 testing set images. For comparison, we also trained and tested a keypoint detection supervised deep learning network for the same set of training / testing images.   Results Whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data, and predicably performed poorly on the testing set (11\% accuracy), the Deep-Q learning approach showed progressive improved generalizability to the testing set over training time, reaching 70\% accuracy.   Conclusion We have shown a proof-of-principle application of reinforcement learning to radiological images, here using 2D contrast-enhanced MRI brain images with the goal of localizing brain tumors.

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as DQN owe their success to Markov Decision Processes, and the fact that maximizing the sum of rewards allows using backward induction and reduce to the Bellman optimality equation. However, many real-world problems require optimization of an objective that is non-linear in cumulative rewards for which dynamic programming cannot be applied directly. For example, in a resource allocation problem, one of the objectives is to maximize long-term fairness among the users. We notice that when the function of the sum of rewards is considered, the problem loses its Markov nature. This paper addresses and formalizes the problem of optimizing a non-linear function of the long term average of rewards. We propose model-based and model-free algorithms to learn the policy, where the model-based policy is shown to achieve a regret of $\Tilde{O}\left(KDSA\sqrt{\frac{A}{T}}\right)$ for $K$ users. Further, using the fairness in cellular base-station scheduling, and queueing system scheduling as examples, the proposed algorithm is shown to significantly outperform the conventional RL approaches.",0

"We propose a novel learning paradigm, Self-Imitation via Reduction (SIR), for solving compositional reinforcement learning problems. SIR is based on two core ideas: task reduction and self-imitation. Task reduction tackles a hard-to-solve task by actively reducing it to an easier task whose solution is known by the RL agent. Once the original hard task is successfully solved by task reduction, the agent naturally obtains a self-generated solution trajectory to imitate. By continuously collecting and imitating such demonstrations, the agent is able to progressively expand the solved subspace in the entire task space. Experiment results show that SIR can significantly accelerate and improve learning on a variety of challenging sparse-reward continuous-control problems with compositional structures.

Once the original task is accomplished, the agent creates a self-generated trajectory to follow. By continuously gathering and replicating these trajectories, the agent can gradually expand its knowledge and skills in the entire task space.

"In real-world tasks, reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently encounter situations that are not present during training time. To ensure reliable performance, the RL agents need to exhibit robustness against worst-case situations. The robust RL framework addresses this challenge via a worst-case optimization between an agent and an adversary. Previous robust RL algorithms are either sample inefficient, lack robustness guarantees, or do not scale to large problems. We propose the Robust Hallucinated Upper-Confidence RL (RH-UCRL) algorithm to provably solve this problem while attaining near-optimal sample complexity guarantees. RH-UCRL is a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm that effectively distinguishes between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and efficiently explores both the agent and adversary decision spaces during policy learning. We scale RH-UCRL to complex tasks via neural networks ensemble models as well as neural network policies. Experimentally, we demonstrate that RH-UCRL outperforms other robust deep RL algorithms in a variety of adversarial environments.",0

"Biomedical knowledge graphs permit an integrative computational approach to reasoning about biological systems. The nature of biological data leads to a graph structure that differs from those typically encountered in benchmarking datasets. To understand the implications this may have on the performance of reasoning algorithms, we conduct an empirical study based on the real-world task of drug repurposing. We formulate this task as a link prediction problem where both compounds and diseases correspond to entities in a knowledge graph. To overcome apparent weaknesses of existing algorithms, we propose a new method, PoLo, that combines policy-guided walks based on reinforcement learning with logical rules. These rules are integrated into the algorithm by using a novel reward function. We apply our method to Hetionet, which integrates biomedical information from 29 prominent bioinformatics databases.

"Reinforcement learning methods trained on few environments rarely learn policies that generalize to unseen environments. To improve generalization, we incorporate the inherent sequential structure in reinforcement learning into the representation learning process. This approach is orthogonal to recent approaches, which rarely exploit this structure explicitly. Specifically, we introduce a theoretically motivated policy similarity metric (PSM) for measuring behavioral similarity between states. PSM assigns high similarity to states for which the optimal policies in those states as well as in future states are similar. We also present a contrastive representation learning procedure to embed any state similarity metric, which we instantiate with PSM to obtain policy similarity embeddings (PSEs). We demonstrate that PSEs improve generalization on diverse benchmarks, including LQR with spurious correlations, a jumping task from pixels, and Distracting DM Control Suite.",0

"In recent years, meta-learning, in which a model is trained on a family of tasks (i.e. a task distribution), has emerged as an approach to training neural networks to perform tasks that were previously assumed to require structured representations, making strides toward closing the gap between humans and machines. However, we argue that evaluating meta-learning remains a challenge, and can miss whether meta-learning actually uses the structure embedded within the tasks. These meta-learners might therefore still be significantly different from humans learners. To demonstrate this difference, we first define a new meta-reinforcement learning task in which a structured task distribution is generated using a compositional grammar. We then introduce a novel approach to constructing a ""null task distribution"" with the same statistical complexity as this structured task distribution but without the explicit rule-based structure used to generate the structured task. We train a standard meta-learning agent, a recurrent network trained with model-free reinforcement learning, and compare it with human performance across the two task distributions. We find a double dissociation in which humans do better in the structured task distribution whereas agents do better in the null task distribution -- despite comparable statistical complexity. This work highlights that multiple strategies can achieve reasonable meta-test performance, and that careful construction of control task distributions is a valuable way to understand which strategies meta-learners acquire, and how they might differ from humans.",0

"Mixture models are an expressive hypothesis class that can approximate a rich set of policies. However, using mixture policies in the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) framework is not straightforward. The entropy of a mixture model is not equal to the sum of its components, nor does it have a closed-form expression in most cases. Using such policies in MaxEnt algorithms, therefore, requires constructing a tractable approximation of the mixture entropy. In this paper, we derive a simple, low-variance mixture-entropy estimator. We show that it is closely related to the sum of marginal entropies. Equipped with our entropy estimator, we derive an algorithmic variant of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to the mixture policy case and evaluate it on a series of continuous control tasks.",0

A novel optimization approach is proposed for application to policy gradient methods and evolution strategies for reinforcement learning (RL). The procedure uses a computationally efficient Wasserstein natural gradient (WNG) descent that takes advantage of the geometry induced by a Wasserstein penalty to speed optimization.

"Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach for scaling up reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. However, it often suffers from training inefficiency as the action space of the high-level, i.e., the goal space, is often large. Searching in a large goal space poses difficulties for both high-level subgoal generation and low-level policy learning. In this paper, we show that this problem can be effectively alleviated by restricting the high-level action space from the whole goal space to a $k$-step adjacent region of the current state using an adjacency constraint. We theoretically prove that the proposed adjacency constraint preserves the optimal hierarchical policy in deterministic MDPs, and show that this constraint can be practically implemented by training an adjacency network that can discriminate between adjacent and non-adjacent subgoals. Experimental results on discrete and continuous control tasks show that incorporating the adjacency constraint improves the performance of state-of-the-art HRL approaches in both deterministic and stochastic environments.",0

"We introduce Adaptive Procedural Task Generation (APT-Gen), an approach to progressively generate a sequence of tasks as curricula to facilitate reinforcement learning in hard-exploration problems. At the heart of our approach, a task generator learns to create tasks from a parameterized task space via a black-box procedural generation module. To enable curriculum learning in the absence of a direct indicator of learning progress, we propose to train the task generator by balancing the agent's performance in the generated tasks and the similarity to the target tasks. Through adversarial training, the task similarity is adaptively estimated by a task discriminator defined on the agent's experiences, allowing the generated tasks to approximate target tasks of unknown parameterization or outside of the predefined task space. Our experiments on the grid world and robotic manipulation task domains show that APT-Gen achieves substantially better performance than various existing baselines by generating suitable tasks of rich variations.",0

"In this paper, we investigate the sample complexity of policy evaluation in infinite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (also known as the off-policy evaluation problem) with linear function approximation. We identify a hard regime $d\gamma^{2}>1$, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature vector and $\gamma$ is the discount rate. In this regime, for any $q\in[\gamma^{2},1]$, we can construct a hard instance such that the smallest eigenvalue of its feature covariance matrix is $q/d$ and it requires $\Omega\left(\frac{d}{\gamma^{2}\left(q-\gamma^{2}\right)\varepsilon^{2}}\exp\left(\Theta\left(d\gamma^{2}\right)\right)\right)$ samples to approximate the value function up to an additive error $\varepsilon$. Note that the lower bound of the sample complexity is exponential in $d$. If $q=\gamma^{2}$, even infinite data cannot suffice. Under the low distribution shift assumption, we show that there is an algorithm that needs at most $O\left(\max\left\{ \frac{\left\Vert \theta^{\pi}\right\Vert _{2}^{4}}{\varepsilon^{4}}\log\frac{d}{\delta},\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}}\left(d+\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right\} \right)$ samples ($\theta^{\pi}$ is the parameter of the policy in linear function approximation) and guarantees approximation to the value function up to an additive error of $\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\delta$.",0
"The aim of this study is to examine the complexity of sample collection required for policy evaluation in infinite-horizon offline reinforcement learning with linear function approximation, also known as the off-policy evaluation problem.

In this scenario, we can construct a complicated instance for any q∈[γ2,1] such that the feature covariance matrix's smallest eigenvalue is q/d. To approximate the value function within an additive error of ε, we require a minimum of Ω(d/γ2(q−γ2)ε2) samples, which is an exponential lower bound in ""d"". Even infinite data cannot suffice when q=γ2. However, assuming a low distribution shift, we have demonstrated an algorithm that can approximate the value function up to an additive error of ε with a probability of at least 1-δ. This algorithm needs only a maximum of O(max{∥θπ∥2^4/ε^4 log(d/δ), (1/ε^2)(d+log(1/δ))}) samples, where θπ is the policy's parameter in linear function approximation.",1
"Offline learning is a key part of making reinforcement learning (RL) useable in real systems. Offline RL looks at scenarios where there is data from a system's operation, but no direct access to the system when learning a policy. Recent work on training RL policies from offline data has shown results both with model-free policies learned directly from the data, or with planning on top of learnt models of the data. Model-free policies tend to be more performant, but are more opaque, harder to command externally, and less easy to integrate into larger systems. We propose an offline learner that generates a model that can be used to control the system directly through planning. This allows us to have easily controllable policies directly from data, without ever interacting with the system. We show the performance of our algorithm, Model-Based Offline Planning (MBOP) on a series of robotics-inspired tasks, and demonstrate its ability leverage planning to respect environmental constraints. We are able to find near-optimal polices for certain simulated systems from as little as 50 seconds of real-time system interaction, and create zero-shot goal-conditioned policies on a series of environments.

In this paper we aim to fill this gap by providing guarantees and convergence rates for the sub-optimality of a policy learned using first-order optimization methods applied to the REPS objective. We first consider the setting in which we are given access to exact gradients and demonstrate how near-optimality of the objective translates to near-optimality of the policy.

"The use of neural networks and reinforcement learning has become increasingly popular in autonomous vehicle control. However, the opaqueness of the resulting control policies presents a significant barrier to deploying neural network-based control in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning based approach to autonomous vehicle longitudinal control, where the rule-based safety cages provide enhanced safety for the vehicle as well as weak supervision to the reinforcement learning agent. By guiding the agent to meaningful states and actions, this weak supervision improves the convergence during training and enhances the safety of the final trained policy. This rule-based supervisory controller has the further advantage of being fully interpretable, thereby enabling traditional validation and verification approaches to ensure the safety of the vehicle. We compare models with and without safety cages, as well as models with optimal and constrained model parameters, and show that the weak supervision consistently improves the safety of exploration, speed of convergence, and model performance. Additionally, we show that when the model parameters are constrained or sub-optimal, the safety cages can enable a model to learn a safe driving policy even when the model could not be trained to drive through reinforcement learning alone.",0

"In this paper, we revisit variational intrinsic control (VIC), an unsupervised reinforcement learning method for finding the largest set of intrinsic options available to an agent. In the original work by Gregor et al. (2016), two VIC algorithms were proposed: one that represents the options explicitly, and the other that does it implicitly. We show that the intrinsic reward used in the latter is subject to bias in stochastic environments, causing convergence to suboptimal solutions. To correct this behavior and achieve the maximal empowerment, we propose two methods respectively based on the transitional probability model and Gaussian mixture model.

"Despite significant progress in challenging problems across various domains, applying state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms remains challenging due to their sensitivity to the choice of hyperparameters. This sensitivity can partly be attributed to the non-stationarity of the RL problem, potentially requiring different hyperparameter settings at various stages of the learning process. Additionally, in the RL setting, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) requires a large number of environment interactions, hindering the transfer of the successes in RL to real-world applications. In this work, we tackle the issues of sample-efficient and dynamic HPO in RL. We propose a population-based automated RL (AutoRL) framework to meta-optimize arbitrary off-policy RL algorithms. In this framework, we optimize the hyperparameters and also the neural architecture while simultaneously training the agent. By sharing the collected experience across the population, we substantially increase the sample efficiency of the meta-optimization. We demonstrate the capabilities of our sample-efficient AutoRL approach in a case study with the popular TD3 algorithm in the MuJoCo benchmark suite, where we reduce the number of environment interactions needed for meta-optimization by up to an order of magnitude compared to population-based training.",0
"The use of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is difficult due to their sensitivity to hyperparameters, despite significant progress in solving challenging problems across different fields. This is partly due to the non-stationarity of the RL problem, which may require different hyperparameter settings at various stages of the learning process. Additionally, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in the RL setting necessitates a large number of environment interactions, making it difficult to apply RL successes to real-world applications. In response to these issues, we propose a population-based automated RL (AutoRL) framework to meta-optimize arbitrary off-policy RL algorithms. Our approach optimizes both hyperparameters and neural architecture while training the agent and shares collected experience across the population, resulting in a substantially increased sample efficiency of the meta-optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a case study using the TD3 algorithm in the MuJoCo benchmark suite, reducing the number of environment interactions required for meta-optimization compared to population-based training by up to an order of magnitude.",1
"Deeply-learned planning methods are often based on learning representations that are optimized for unrelated tasks. For example, they might be trained on reconstructing the environment. These representations are then combined with predictor functions for simulating rollouts to navigate the environment. We find this principle of learning representations unsatisfying and propose to learn them such that they are directly optimized for the task at hand: to be maximally predictable for the predictor function. This results in representations that are by design optimal for the downstream task of planning, where the learned predictor function is used as a forward model.   To this end, we propose a new way of jointly learning this representation along with the prediction function, a system we dub Latent Representation Prediction Network (LARP). The prediction function is used as a forward model for search on a graph in a viewpoint-matching task and the representation learned to maximize predictability is found to outperform a pre-trained representation. Our approach is shown to be more sample-efficient than standard reinforcement learning methods and our learned representation transfers successfully to dissimilar objects.",0

"Offline reinforcement learning restricts the learning process to rely only on logged-data without access to an environment. While this enables real-world applications, it also poses unique challenges. One important challenge is dealing with errors caused by the overestimation of values for state-action pairs not well-covered by the training data. Due to bootstrapping, these errors get amplified during training and can lead to divergence, thereby crippling learning. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Regularized Behavior Value Estimation (R-BVE). Unlike most approaches, which use policy improvement during training, R-BVE estimates the value of the behavior policy during training and only performs policy improvement at deployment time. Further, R-BVE uses a ranking regularisation term that favours actions in the dataset that lead to successful outcomes. We provide ample empirical evidence of R-BVE's effectiveness, including state-of-the-art performance on the RL Unplugged ATARI dataset. We also test R-BVE on new datasets, from bsuite and a challenging DeepMind Lab task, and show that R-BVE outperforms other state-of-the-art discrete control offline RL methods.",0
"The learning process in offline reinforcement learning is limited to logged-data and excludes access to an environment.

"Deploying Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in the real-world require that the agents satisfy safety constraints. Current RL agents explore the environment without considering these constraints, which can lead to damage to the hardware or even other agents in the environment. We propose a new method, LBPO, that uses a Lyapunov-based barrier function to restrict the policy update to a safe set for each training iteration. Our method also allows the user to control the conservativeness of the agent with respect to the constraints in the environment. LBPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the number of constraint violations during training while being competitive in terms of performance. Further, our analysis reveals that baselines like CPO and SDDPG rely mostly on backtracking to ensure safety rather than safe projection, which provides insight into why previous methods might not have effectively limit the number of constraint violations.",0

"Recent work has shown that sparse representations -- where only a small percentage of units are active -- can significantly reduce interference. Those works, however, relied on relatively complex regularization or meta-learning approaches, that have only been used offline in a pre-training phase. In this work, we pursue a direction that achieves sparsity by design, rather than by learning. Specifically, we design an activation function that produces sparse representations deterministically by construction, and so is more amenable to online training. The idea relies on the simple approach of binning, but overcomes the two key limitations of binning: zero gradients for the flat regions almost everywhere, and lost precision -- reduced discrimination -- due to coarse aggregation. We introduce a Fuzzy Tiling Activation (FTA) that provides non-negligible gradients and produces overlap between bins that improves discrimination. We first show that FTA is robust under covariate shift in a synthetic online supervised learning problem, where we can vary the level of correlation and drift. Then we move to the deep reinforcement learning setting and investigate both value-based and policy gradient algorithms that use neural networks with FTAs, in classic discrete control and Mujoco continuous control environments. We show that algorithms equipped with FTAs are able to learn a stable policy faster without needing target networks on most domains.",0

"Q-learning, which seeks to learn the optimal Q-function of a Markov decision process (MDP) in a model-free fashion, lies at the heart of reinforcement learning. When it comes to the synchronous setting (such that independent samples for all state-action pairs are drawn from a generative model in each iteration), substantial progress has been made recently towards understanding the sample efficiency of Q-learning. Take a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon MDP with state space $\mathcal{S}$ and action space $\mathcal{A}$: to yield an entrywise $\varepsilon$-accurate estimate of the optimal Q-function, state-of-the-art theory for Q-learning proves that a sample size on the order of $\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{(1-\gamma)^5\varepsilon^{2}}$ is sufficient, which, however, fails to match with the existing minimax lower bound. This gives rise to natural questions: what is the sharp sample complexity of Q-learning? Is Q-learning provably sub-optimal? In this work, we settle these questions by (1) demonstrating that the sample complexity of Q-learning is at most on the order of $\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{(1-\gamma)^4\varepsilon^2}$ (up to some log factor) for any $0<\varepsilon <1$, and (2) developing a matching lower bound to confirm the sharpness of our result. Our findings unveil both the effectiveness and limitation of Q-learning: its sample complexity matches that of speedy Q-learning without requiring extra computation and storage, albeit still being considerably higher than the minimax lower bound.",0

"This paper develops a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture for multi-mission spaceflight campaign design under uncertainty, including vehicle design, infrastructure deployment planning, and space transportation scheduling. This problem involves a high-dimensional design space and is challenging especially with uncertainty present. To tackle this challenge, the developed framework has a hierarchical structure with reinforcement learning (RL) and network-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), where the former optimizes campaign-level decisions (e.g., design of the vehicle used throughout the campaign, destination demand assigned to each mission in the campaign), whereas the latter optimizes the detailed mission-level decisions (e.g., when to launch what from where to where). The framework is applied to a set of human lunar exploration campaign scenarios with uncertain in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) performance as a case study. The main value of this work is its integration of the rapidly growing RL research and the existing MILP-based space logistics methods through a hierarchical framework to handle the otherwise intractable complexity of space mission design under uncertainty.

"Reinforcement learning algorithms are widely used in domains where it is desirable to provide a personalized service. In these domains it is common that user data contains sensitive information that needs to be protected from third parties. Motivated by this, we study privacy in the context of finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by requiring information to be obfuscated on the user side. We formulate this notion of privacy for RL by leveraging the local differential privacy (LDP) framework. We present an optimistic algorithm that simultaneously satisfies LDP requirements, and achieves sublinear regret. We also establish a lower bound for regret minimization in finite-horizon MDPs with LDP guarantees. These results show that while LDP is appealing in practical applications, the setting is inherently more complex. In particular, our results demonstrate that the cost of privacy is multiplicative when compared to non-private settings.",0

"Safety is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in real-world situations. Chance constraints are suitable to represent the safety requirements in stochastic systems. Previous chance-constrained RL methods usually have a low convergence rate, or only learn a conservative policy. In this paper, we propose a model-based chance constrained actor-critic (CCAC) algorithm which can efficiently learn a safe and non-conservative policy. Different from existing methods that optimize a conservative lower bound, CCAC directly solves the original chance constrained problems, where the objective function and safe probability is simultaneously optimized with adaptive weights. In order to improve the convergence rate, CCAC utilizes the gradient of dynamic model to accelerate policy optimization. The effectiveness of CCAC is demonstrated by a stochastic car-following task. Experiments indicate that compared with previous RL methods, CCAC improves the performance while guaranteeing safety, with a five times faster convergence rate. It also has 100 times higher online computation efficiency than traditional safety techniques such as stochastic model predictive control.",0

"Successor-style representations have many advantages for reinforcement learning: for example, they can help an agent generalize from past experience to new goals, and they have been proposed as explanations of behavioral and neural data from human and animal learners. They also form a natural bridge between model-based and model-free RL methods: like the former they make predictions about future experiences, and like the latter they allow efficient prediction of total discounted rewards. However, successor-style representations are not optimized to generalize across policies: typically, we maintain a limited-length list of policies, and share information among them by representation learning or GPI. Successor-style representations also typically make no provision for gathering information or reasoning about latent variables. To address these limitations, we bring together ideas from predictive state representations, belief space value iteration, successor features, and convex analysis: we develop a new, general successor-style representation, together with a Bellman equation that connects multiple sources of information within this representation, including different latent states, policies, and reward functions. The new representation is highly expressive: for example, it lets us efficiently read off an optimal policy for a new reward function, or a policy that imitates a new demonstration. For this paper, we focus on exact computation of the new representation in small, known environments, since even this restricted setting offers plenty of interesting questions. Our implementation does not scale to large, unknown environments -- nor would we expect it to, since it generalizes POMDP value iteration, which is difficult to scale. However, we believe that future work will allow us to extend our ideas to approximate reasoning in large, unknown environments.",0

However, these representations are not designed to generalize across policies, and typically only consider a limited list of policies. Furthermore, they do not account for latent variables. To overcome these limitations, we combine ideas from various approaches and develop a new successor-style representation that can connect information from different sources, including latent states, policies, and reward functions. This new representation is highly expressive and allows for the efficient computation of optimal policies for new reward functions or imitating new demonstrations. While our implementation is limited to small, known environments, we believe that future work will enable us to apply our ideas to larger, unknown environments.",1
"Adversarial training, a special case of multi-objective optimization, is an increasingly prevalent machine learning technique: some of its most notable applications include GAN-based generative modeling and self-play techniques in reinforcement learning which have been applied to complex games such as Go or Poker. In practice, a \emph{single} pair of networks is typically trained in order to find an approximate equilibrium of a highly nonconcave-nonconvex adversarial problem. However, while a classic result in game theory states such an equilibrium exists in concave-convex games, there is no analogous guarantee if the payoff is nonconcave-nonconvex. Our main contribution is to provide an approximate minimax theorem for a large class of games where the players pick neural networks including WGAN, StarCraft II, and Blotto Game. Our findings rely on the fact that despite being nonconcave-nonconvex with respect to the neural networks parameters, these games are concave-convex with respect to the actual models (e.g., functions or distributions) represented by these neural networks.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms aim to learn optimal decisions in unknown environments through experience of taking actions and observing the rewards gained. In some cases, the environment is not influenced by the actions of the RL agent, in which case the problem can be modeled as a contextual multi-armed bandit and lightweight \emph{myopic} algorithms can be employed. On the other hand, when the RL agent's actions affect the environment, the problem must be modeled as a Markov decision process and more complex RL algorithms are required which take the future effects of actions into account. Moreover, in many modern RL settings, it is unknown from the outset whether or not the agent's actions will impact the environment and it is often not possible to determine which RL algorithm is most fitting. In this work, we propose to avoid this dilemma entirely and incorporate a choice mechanism into our RL framework. Rather than assuming a specific problem structure, we use a probabilistic structure estimation procedure based on a likelihood-ratio (LR) test to make a more informed selection of learning algorithm. We derive a sufficient condition under which myopic policies are optimal, present an LR test for this condition, and derive a bound on the regret of our framework. We provide examples of real-world scenarios where our framework is needed and provide extensive simulations to validate our approach.",0

"The recent remarkable progress of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) stands on regularization of policy for stable and efficient learning. A popular method, named proximal policy optimization (PPO), has been introduced for this purpose. PPO clips density ratio of the latest and baseline policies with a threshold, while its minimization target is unclear. As another problem of PPO, the symmetric threshold is given numerically while the density ratio itself is in asymmetric domain, thereby causing unbalanced regularization of the policy. This paper therefore proposes a new variant of PPO by considering a regularization problem of relative Pearson (RPE) divergence, so-called PPO-RPE. This regularization yields the clear minimization target, which constrains the latest policy to the baseline one. Through its analysis, the intuitive threshold-based design consistent with the asymmetry of the threshold and the domain of density ratio can be derived. Through four benchmark tasks, PPO-RPE performed as well as or better than the conventional methods in terms of the task performance by the learned policy.",0

"Reinforcement learning has been shown to be highly successful at many challenging tasks. However, success heavily relies on well-shaped rewards. Intrinsically motivated RL attempts to remove this constraint by defining an intrinsic reward function. Motivated by the self-consciousness concept in psychology, we make a natural assumption that the agent knows what constitutes itself, and propose a new intrinsic objective that encourages the agent to have maximum control on the environment. We mathematically formalize this reward as the mutual information between the agent state and the surrounding state under the current agent policy. With this new intrinsic motivation, we are able to outperform previous methods, including being able to complete the pick-and-place task for the first time without using any task reward.

"Many modern approaches to offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) utilize behavior regularization, typically augmenting a model-free actor critic algorithm with a penalty measuring divergence of the policy from the offline data. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to encouraging the learned policy to stay close to the data, namely parameterizing the critic as the log-behavior-policy, which generated the offline data, plus a state-action value offset term, which can be learned using a neural network. Behavior regularization then corresponds to an appropriate regularizer on the offset term. We propose using a gradient penalty regularizer for the offset term and demonstrate its equivalence to Fisher divergence regularization, suggesting connections to the score matching and generative energy-based model literature. We thus term our resulting algorithm Fisher-BRC (Behavior Regularized Critic). On standard offline RL benchmarks, Fisher-BRC achieves both improved performance and faster convergence over existing state-of-the-art methods.",0

"A core operation in reinforcement learning (RL) is finding an action that is optimal with respect to a learned value function.

We show that the maximum action-value with respect to a deep RBVF can be approximated easily and accurately. Moreover, deep RBVFs can represent any true value function owing to their support for universal function approximation.

Moreover, information about the system and its environment is typically incomplete or imperfect. Probabilistic representations of systems and environments may therefore be called for, especially to support decisions in application areas where actions may have severe consequences.   In this paper we introduce the probabilistic digital twin (PDT). We will start by discussing how epistemic uncertainty can be treated using measure theory, by modelling epistemic information via $\sigma$-algebras. Based on this, we give a formal definition of how epistemic uncertainty can be updated in a PDT. We then study the problem of optimal sequential decision making. That is, we consider the case where the outcome of each decision may inform the next. Within the PDT framework, we formulate this optimization problem. We discuss how this problem may be solved (at least in theory) via the maximum principle method or the dynamic programming principle. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, these methods are often not tractable in practice. To mend this, we propose a generic approximate solution using deep reinforcement learning together with neural networks defined on sets. We illustrate the method on a practical problem, considering optimal information gathering for the estimation of a failure probability.",0
"Many industries are adopting digital twins, which consist of simulation models and data related to a specific physical system.

"Negotiation, as an essential and complicated aspect of online shopping, is still challenging for an intelligent agent. To that end, we propose the Price Negotiator, a modular deep neural network that addresses the unsolved problems in recent studies by (1) considering images of the items as a crucial, though neglected, source of information in a negotiation, (2) heuristically finding the most similar items from an external online source to predict the potential value and an acceptable agreement price, (3) predicting a general price-based action at each turn which is fed into the language generator to output the supporting natural language, and (4) adjusting the prices based on the predicted actions. Empirically, we show that our model, that is trained in both supervised and reinforcement learning setting, significantly improves negotiation on the CraigslistBargain dataset, in terms of the agreement price, price consistency, and dialogue quality.",0
"Online shopping negotiations remain a complex and fundamental aspect that poses a challenge for intelligent agents. Our proposed solution, the Price Negotiator, utilizes a modular deep neural network that addresses unresolved issues in recent studies.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are typically limited to learning a single solution of a specified task, even though there often exists diverse solutions to a given task. Compared with learning a single solution, learning a set of diverse solutions is beneficial because diverse solutions enable robust few-shot adaptation and allow the user to select a preferred solution. Although previous studies have showed that diverse behaviors can be modeled with a policy conditioned on latent variables, an approach for modeling an infinite set of diverse solutions with continuous latent variables has not been investigated. In this study, we propose an RL method that can learn infinitely many solutions by training a policy conditioned on a continuous or discrete low-dimensional latent variable. Through continuous control tasks, we demonstrate that our method can learn diverse solutions in a data-efficient manner and that the solutions can be used for few-shot adaptation to solve unseen tasks.",0

"In the present paper, we propose a decoder-free extension of Dreamer, a leading model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method from pixels. Dreamer is a sample- and cost-efficient solution to robot learning, as it is used to train latent state-space models based on a variational autoencoder and to conduct policy optimization by latent trajectory imagination. However, this autoencoding based approach often causes object vanishing, in which the autoencoder fails to perceives key objects for solving control tasks, and thus significantly limiting Dreamer's potential. This work aims to relieve this Dreamer's bottleneck and enhance its performance by means of removing the decoder. For this purpose, we firstly derive a likelihood-free and InfoMax objective of contrastive learning from the evidence lower bound of Dreamer. Secondly, we incorporate two components, (i) independent linear dynamics and (ii) the random crop data augmentation, to the learning scheme so as to improve the training performance. In comparison to Dreamer and other recent model-free reinforcement learning methods, our newly devised Dreamer with InfoMax and without generative decoder (Dreaming) achieves the best scores on 5 difficult simulated robotics tasks, in which Dreamer suffers from object vanishing.",0

"We accelerate deep reinforcement learning-based training in visually complex 3D environments by two orders of magnitude over prior work, realizing end-to-end training speeds of over 19,000 frames of experience per second on a single GPU and up to 72,000 frames per second on a single eight-GPU machine. The key idea of our approach is to design a 3D renderer and embodied navigation simulator around the principle of ""batch simulation"": accepting and executing large batches of requests simultaneously. Beyond exposing large amounts of work at once, batch simulation allows implementations to amortize in-memory storage of scene assets, rendering work, data loading, and synchronization costs across many simulation requests, dramatically improving the number of simulated agents per GPU and overall simulation throughput. To balance DNN inference and training costs with faster simulation, we also build a computationally efficient policy DNN that maintains high task performance, and modify training algorithms to maintain sample efficiency when training with large mini-batches. By combining batch simulation and DNN performance optimizations, we demonstrate that PointGoal navigation agents can be trained in complex 3D environments on a single GPU in 1.5 days to 97% of the accuracy of agents trained on a prior state-of-the-art system using a 64-GPU cluster over three days.

"Bayesian inference over the reward presents an ideal solution to the ill-posed nature of the inverse reinforcement learning problem. Unfortunately current methods generally do not scale well beyond the small tabular setting due to the need for an inner-loop MDP solver, and even non-Bayesian methods that do themselves scale often require extensive interaction with the environment to perform well, being inappropriate for high stakes or costly applications such as healthcare. In this paper we introduce our method, Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL), that addresses both of these issues by jointly learning an approximate posterior distribution over the reward that scales to arbitrarily complicated state spaces alongside an appropriate policy in a completely offline manner through a variational approach to said latent reward. Applying our method to real medical data alongside classic control simulations, we demonstrate Bayesian reward inference in environments beyond the scope of current methods, as well as task performance competitive with focused offline imitation learning algorithms.",0

"Compressed sensing can decrease scanning transmission electron microscopy electron dose and scan time with minimal information loss. Traditionally, sparse scans used in compressed sensing sample a static set of probing locations. However, dynamic scans that adapt to specimens are expected to be able to match or surpass the performance of static scans as static scans are a subset of possible dynamic scans. Thus, we present a prototype for a contiguous sparse scan system that piecewise adapts scan paths to specimens as they are scanned. Sampling directions for scan segments are chosen by a recurrent neural network based on previously observed scan segments. The recurrent neural network is trained by reinforcement learning to cooperate with a feedforward convolutional neural network that completes the sparse scans. This paper presents our learning policy, experiments, and example partial scans, and discusses future research directions.

"In this work we discuss the incorporation of quadratic neurons into policy networks in the context of model-free actor-critic reinforcement learning. Quadratic neurons admit an explicit quadratic function approximation in contrast to conventional approaches where the the non-linearity is induced by the activation functions. We perform empiric experiments on several MuJoCo continuous control tasks and find that when quadratic neurons are added to MLP policy networks those outperform the baseline MLP whilst admitting a smaller number of parameters. The top returned reward is in average increased by $5.8\%$ while being about $21\%$ more sample efficient. Moreover, it can maintain its advantage against added action and observation noise.",0

"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has recently gained immense interest due to its potential for sample efficiency and ability to incorporate off-policy data. However, designing stable and efficient MBRL algorithms using rich function approximators have remained challenging. To help expose the practical challenges in MBRL and simplify algorithm design from the lens of abstraction, we develop a new framework that casts MBRL as a game between: (1) a policy player, which attempts to maximize rewards under the learned model; (2) a model player, which attempts to fit the real-world data collected by the policy player. For algorithm development, we construct a Stackelberg game between the two players, and show that it can be solved with approximate bi-level optimization. This gives rise to two natural families of algorithms for MBRL based on which player is chosen as the leader in the Stackelberg game. Together, they encapsulate, unify, and generalize many previous MBRL algorithms. Furthermore, our framework is consistent with and provides a clear basis for heuristics known to be important in practice from prior works. Finally, through experiments we validate that our proposed algorithms are highly sample efficient, match the asymptotic performance of model-free policy gradient, and scale gracefully to high-dimensional tasks like dexterous hand manipulation. Additional details and code can be obtained from the project page at https://sites.google.com/view/mbrl-game",0

"Reinforcement learning algorithms, just like any other Machine learning algorithm pose a serious threat from adversaries. The adversaries can manipulate the learning algorithm resulting in non-optimal policies. In this paper, we analyze the Multi-task Federated Reinforcement Learning algorithms, where multiple collaborative agents in various environments are trying to maximize the sum of discounted return, in the presence of adversarial agents. We argue that the common attack methods are not guaranteed to carry out a successful attack on Multi-task Federated Reinforcement Learning and propose an adaptive attack method with better attack performance. Furthermore, we modify the conventional federated reinforcement learning algorithm to address the issue of adversaries that works equally well with and without the adversaries. Experimentation on different small to mid-size reinforcement learning problems show that the proposed attack method outperforms other general attack methods and the proposed modification to federated reinforcement learning algorithm was able to achieve near-optimal policies in the presence of adversarial agents.",0

"We analyze the hidden activations of neural network policies of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents and show, empirically, that it's possible to know a priori if a state representation will lend itself to fast learning. RL agents in high-dimensional states have two main learning burdens: (1) to learn an action-selection policy and (2) to learn to discern between useful and non-useful information in a given state. By learning a latent representation of these high-dimensional states with an auxiliary model, the latter burden is effectively removed, thereby leading to accelerated training progress. We examine this phenomenon across tasks in the PyBullet Kuka environment, where an agent must learn to control a robotic gripper to pick up an object. Our analysis reveals how neural network policies learn to organize their internal representation of the state space throughout training. The results from this analysis provide three main insights into how deep RL agents learn. First, a well-organized internal representation within the policy network is a prerequisite to learning good action-selection. Second, a poor initial representation can cause an unrecoverable collapse within a policy network. Third, a good initial representation allows an agent's policy network to organize its internal representation even before any training begins.",0
"Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that it is possible to determine in advance whether a state representation will facilitate rapid learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents by scrutinizing the concealed activations of neural network policies.

"We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method, HIDIO, that can learn task-agnostic options in a self-supervised manner while jointly learning to utilize them to solve sparse-reward tasks. Unlike current hierarchical RL approaches that tend to formulate goal-reaching low-level tasks or pre-define ad hoc lower-level policies, HIDIO encourages lower-level option learning that is independent of the task at hand, requiring few assumptions or little knowledge about the task structure. These options are learned through an intrinsic entropy minimization objective conditioned on the option sub-trajectories. The learned options are diverse and task-agnostic. In experiments on sparse-reward robotic manipulation and navigation tasks, HIDIO achieves higher success rates with greater sample efficiency than regular RL baselines and two state-of-the-art hierarchical RL methods.",0

"Meta-reinforcement learning typically requires orders of magnitude more samples than single task reinforcement learning methods. This is because meta-training needs to deal with more diverse distributions and train extra components such as context encoders. To address this, we propose a novel self-supervised learning task, which we named Trajectory Contrastive Learning (TCL), to improve meta-training. TCL adopts contrastive learning and trains a context encoder to predict whether two transition windows are sampled from the same trajectory. TCL leverages the natural hierarchical structure of context-based meta-RL and makes minimal assumptions, allowing it to be generally applicable to context-based meta-RL algorithms. It accelerates the training of context encoders and improves meta-training overall.

"Many potential applications of reinforcement learning (RL) require guarantees that the agent will perform well in the face of disturbances to the dynamics or reward function. In this paper, we prove theoretically that standard maximum entropy RL is robust to some disturbances in the dynamics and the reward function. While this capability of MaxEnt RL has been observed empirically in prior work, to the best of our knowledge our work provides the first rigorous proof and theoretical characterization of the MaxEnt RL robust set. While a number of prior robust RL algorithms have been designed to handle similar disturbances to the reward function or dynamics, these methods typically require adding additional moving parts and hyperparameters on top of a base RL algorithm. In contrast, our theoretical results suggest that MaxEnt RL by itself is robust to certain disturbances, without requiring any additional modifications.

"How do we formalize the challenge of credit assignment in reinforcement learning? Common intuition would draw attention to reward sparsity as a key contributor to difficult credit assignment and traditional heuristics would look to temporal recency for the solution, calling upon the classic eligibility trace. We posit that it is not the sparsity of the reward itself that causes difficulty in credit assignment, but rather the \emph{information sparsity}. We propose to use information theory to define this notion, which we then use to characterize when credit assignment is an obstacle to efficient learning. With this perspective, we outline several information-theoretic mechanisms for measuring credit under a fixed behavior policy, highlighting the potential of information theory as a key tool towards provably-efficient credit assignment.",0

With this approach, we can leverage information theory as a powerful tool for achieving provably-efficient credit assignment.",1
"This paper presents a method for learning logical task specifications and cost functions from demonstrations. Linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas are widely used to express complex objectives and constraints for autonomous systems. Yet, such specifications may be challenging to construct by hand. Instead, we consider demonstrated task executions, whose temporal logic structure and transition costs need to be inferred by an autonomous agent. We employ a spectral learning approach to extract a weighted finite automaton (WFA), approximating the unknown logic structure of the task. Thereafter, we define a product between the WFA for high-level task guidance and a Labeled Markov decision process (L-MDP) for low-level control and optimize a cost function that matches the demonstrator's behavior. We demonstrate that our method is capable of generalizing the execution of the inferred task specification to new environment configurations.",0

For this formulation, we propose a variant of the MAML method, named Stochastic Gradient Meta-Reinforcement Learning (SG-MRL), and study its convergence properties. We derive the iteration and sample complexity of SG-MRL to find an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point, which, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first convergence guarantee for model-agnostic meta-reinforcement learning algorithms.

Additionally, FMDP-BF outperforms the previous best result for FMDPs~\citep{osband2014near} by a factor of $\sqrt{H|\mathcal{S}_i|}$, where $|\mathcal{S}_i|$ represents the cardinality of the factored state subspace, and $H$ refers to the planning horizon. To demonstrate the optimality of our bounds, we provide a lower bound for FMDP, which establishes that our algorithm is almost optimal concerning the timestep $T$, horizon $H$, and factored state-action subspace cardinality. Finally, we present an application of our work by studying a new formulation of constrained RL, referred to as RL with knapsack constraints (RLwK), and present the first sample-efficient algorithm based on FMDP-BF.",1
"Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is the task of estimating the expected reward of a given policy based on offline data previously collected under different policies. Therefore, OPE is a key step in applying reinforcement learning to real-world domains such as medical treatment, where interactive data collection is expensive or even unsafe. As the observed data tends to be noisy and limited, it is essential to provide rigorous uncertainty quantification, not just a point estimation, when applying OPE to make high stakes decisions. This work considers the problem of constructing non-asymptotic confidence intervals in infinite-horizon off-policy evaluation, which remains a challenging open question. We develop a practical algorithm through a primal-dual optimization-based approach, which leverages the kernel Bellman loss (KBL) of Feng et al.(2019) and a new martingale concentration inequality of KBL applicable to time-dependent data with unknown mixing conditions. Our algorithm makes minimum assumptions on the data and the function class of the Q-function, and works for the behavior-agnostic settings where the data is collected under a mix of arbitrary unknown behavior policies. We present empirical results that clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing methods.",0

"Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have resulted in recent breakthroughs in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) across many different domains. An emerging landscape of development environments is making powerful RL techniques more accessible for a growing community of researchers. However, most existing frameworks do not directly address the problem of learning in complex operating environments, such as dense urban settings or defense-related scenarios, that incorporate distributed, heterogeneous teams of agents. To help enable AI research for this important class of applications, we introduce the AI Arena: a scalable framework with flexible abstractions for distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning.

"Many healthcare decisions involve navigating through a multitude of treatment options in a sequential and iterative manner to find an optimal treatment pathway with the goal of an optimal patient outcome. Such optimization problems may be amenable to reinforcement learning.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its ability to solve high dimensional tasks by leveraging non-linear function approximators. However, these successes are mostly achieved by 'black-box' policies in simulated domains. When deploying RL to the real world, several concerns regarding the use of a 'black-box' policy might be raised. In order to make the learned policies more transparent, we propose in this paper a policy iteration scheme that retains a complex function approximator for its internal value predictions but constrains the policy to have a concise, hierarchical, and human-readable structure, based on a mixture of interpretable experts. Each expert selects a primitive action according to a distance to a prototypical state. A key design decision to keep such experts interpretable is to select the prototypical states from trajectory data. The main technical contribution of the paper is to address the challenges introduced by this non-differentiable prototypical state selection procedure. Experimentally, we show that our proposed algorithm can learn compelling policies on continuous action deep RL benchmarks, matching the performance of neural network based policies, but returning policies that are more amenable to human inspection than neural network or linear-in-feature policies.",0

"Trust region methods are a popular tool in reinforcement learning as they yield robust policy updates in continuous and discrete action spaces. However, enforcing such trust regions in deep reinforcement learning is difficult. Hence, many approaches, such as Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are based on approximations. Due to those approximations, they violate the constraints or fail to find the optimal solution within the trust region. Moreover, they are difficult to implement, often lack sufficient exploration, and have been shown to depend on seemingly unrelated implementation choices. In this work, we propose differentiable neural network layers to enforce trust regions for deep Gaussian policies via closed-form projections. Unlike existing methods, those layers formalize trust regions for each state individually and can complement existing reinforcement learning algorithms. We derive trust region projections based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Wasserstein L2 distance, and the Frobenius norm for Gaussian distributions. We empirically demonstrate that those projection layers achieve similar or better results than existing methods while being almost agnostic to specific implementation choices.

"In this paper, we are tackling the proposal-free referring expression grounding task, aiming at localizing the target object according to a query sentence, without relying on off-the-shelf object proposals. Existing proposal-free methods employ a query-image matching branch to select the highest-score point in the image feature map as the target box center, with its width and height predicted by another branch. Such methods, however, fail to utilize the contextual relation between the target and reference objects, and lack interpretability on its reasoning procedure. To solve these problems, we propose an iterative shrinking mechanism to localize the target, where the shrinking direction is decided by a reinforcement learning agent, with all contents within the current image patch comprehensively considered. Beside, the sequential shrinking process enables to demonstrate the reasoning about how to iteratively find the target. Experiments show that the proposed method boosts the accuracy by 4.32% against the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method on the RefCOCOg dataset, where query sentences are long and complex, with many targets referred by other reference objects.",0
"The main focus of this paper is to address the task of referring expression grounding without relying on pre-existing object proposals. The objective is to locate the target object based on a given query sentence.

However, this approach does not take into account the contextual relationship between the target and reference objects and lacks interpretability on the reasoning process. To overcome these issues, we introduce an iterative shrinking mechanism that uses reinforcement learning to determine the shrinking direction. This mechanism considers all the contents within the current image patch comprehensively. Additionally, the sequential shrinking process allows for the demonstration of the reasoning behind the iterative search for the target object.

"This work proposes a scheme that allows learning complex multi-agent behaviors in a sample efficient manner, applied to 2v2 soccer. The problem is formulated as a Markov game, and solved using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a basic multi-agent extension of TD3 for learning the policy of each player, in a decentralized manner. To ease learning, the task of 2v2 soccer is divided in three stages: 1v0, 1v1 and 2v2. The process of learning in multi-agent stages (1v1 and 2v2) uses agents trained on a previous stage as fixed opponents. In addition, we propose using experience sharing, a method that shares experience from a fixed opponent, trained in a previous stage, for training the agent currently learning, and a form of frame-skipping, to raise performance significantly. Our results show that high quality soccer play can be obtained with our approach in just under 40M interactions. A summarized video of the resulting game play can be found in https://youtu.be/f25l1j1U9RM.",0

"Reinforcement learning in cooperative multi-agent settings has recently advanced significantly in its scope, with applications in cooperative estimation for advertising, dynamic treatment regimes, distributed control, and federated learning. In this paper, we discuss the problem of cooperative multi-agent RL with function approximation, where a group of agents communicates with each other to jointly solve an episodic MDP. We demonstrate that via careful message-passing and cooperative value iteration, it is possible to achieve near-optimal no-regret learning even with a fixed constant communication budget. Next, we demonstrate that even in heterogeneous cooperative settings, it is possible to achieve Pareto-optimal no-regret learning with limited communication. Our work generalizes several ideas from the multi-agent contextual and multi-armed bandit literature to MDPs and reinforcement learning.",0

"In offline reinforcement learning (RL), we seek to utilize offline data to evaluate (or learn) policies in scenarios where the data are collected from a distribution that substantially differs from that of the target policy to be evaluated. Recent theoretical advances have shown that such sample-efficient offline RL is indeed possible provided certain strong representational conditions hold, else there are lower bounds exhibiting exponential error amplification (in the problem horizon) unless the data collection distribution has only a mild distribution shift relative to the target policy. This work studies these issues from an empirical perspective to gauge how stable offline RL methods are. In particular, our methodology explores these ideas when using features from pre-trained neural networks, in the hope that these representations are powerful enough to permit sample efficient offline RL. Through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, we see that substantial error amplification does occur even when using such pre-trained representations (trained on the same task itself); we find offline RL is stable only under extremely mild distribution shift. The implications of these results, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective, are that successful offline RL (where we seek to go beyond the low distribution shift regime) requires substantially stronger conditions beyond those which suffice for successful supervised learning.",0
"The goal of offline reinforcement learning is to utilize existing data to evaluate or learn policies, even when the data was collected from a distribution that differs greatly from the target policy. Recent theoretical advancements have shown that successful offline RL is achievable, but only if specific representational conditions are met. If not, there are lower bounds that exhibit exponential error amplification, unless the data collection distribution has only a slight shift compared to the target policy. This study explores these issues empirically, specifically when using features from pre-trained neural networks, which are expected to be powerful enough for sample-efficient offline RL. The results of extensive experiments on various tasks show that significant error amplification occurs, even when using pre-trained representations from the same task. Offline RL stability is only possible with exceedingly mild distribution shift. These findings suggest that successful offline RL requires much stronger conditions than those for successful supervised learning, both theoretically and empirically.",1
"We study episodic reinforcement learning under unknown adversarial corruptions in both the rewards and the transition probabilities of the underlying system. We propose new algorithms which, compared to the existing results in (Lykouris et al., 2020), achieve strictly better regret bounds in terms of total corruptions for the tabular setting. To be specific, firstly, our regret bounds depend on more precise numerical values of total rewards corruptions and transition corruptions, instead of only on the total number of corrupted episodes. Secondly, our regret bounds are the first of their kind in the reinforcement learning setting to have the number of corruptions show up additively with respect to $\min\{\sqrt{T}, \text{PolicyGapComplexity}\}$ rather than multiplicatively. Our results follow from a general algorithmic framework that combines corruption-robust policy elimination meta-algorithms, and plug-in reward-free exploration sub-algorithms. Replacing the meta-algorithm or sub-algorithm may extend the framework to address other corrupted settings with potentially more structure.",0

"Transferring knowledge among various environments is important to efficiently learn multiple tasks online. Most existing methods directly use the previously learned models or previously learned optimal policies to learn new tasks. However, these methods may be inefficient when the underlying models or optimal policies are substantially different across tasks. In this paper, we propose Template Learning (TempLe), the first PAC-MDP method for multi-task reinforcement learning that could be applied to tasks with varying state/action space. TempLe generates transition dynamics templates, abstractions of the transition dynamics across tasks, to gain sample efficiency by extracting similarities between tasks even when their underlying models or optimal policies have limited commonalities. We present two algorithms for an ""online"" and a ""finite-model"" setting respectively. We prove that our proposed TempLe algorithms achieve much lower sample complexity than single-task learners or state-of-the-art multi-task methods.

"Obstacle avoidance is a fundamental and challenging problem for autonomous navigation of mobile robots. In this paper, we consider the problem of obstacle avoidance in simple 3D environments where the robot has to solely rely on a single monocular camera. In particular, we are interested in solving this problem without relying on localization, mapping, or planning techniques. Most of the existing work consider obstacle avoidance as two separate problems, namely obstacle detection, and control. Inspired by the recent advantages of deep reinforcement learning in Atari games and understanding highly complex situations in Go, we tackle the obstacle avoidance problem as a data-driven end-to-end deep learning approach. Our approach takes raw images as input and generates control commands as output. We show that discrete action spaces are outperforming continuous control commands in terms of expected average reward in maze-like environments. Furthermore, we show how to accelerate the learning and increase the robustness of the policy by incorporating predicted depth maps by a generative adversarial network.",0

"Although the notion of task similarity is potentially interesting in a wide range of areas such as curriculum learning or automated planning, it has mostly been tied to transfer learning. Transfer is based on the idea of reusing the knowledge acquired in the learning of a set of source tasks to a new learning process in a target task, assuming that the target and source tasks are close enough. In recent years, transfer learning has succeeded in making Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms more efficient (e.g., by reducing the number of samples needed to achieve the (near-)optimal performance). Transfer in RL is based on the core concept of similarity: whenever the tasks are similar, the transferred knowledge can be reused to solve the target task and significantly improve the learning performance. Therefore, the selection of good metrics to measure these similarities is a critical aspect when building transfer RL algorithms, especially when this knowledge is transferred from simulation to the real world. In the literature, there are many metrics to measure the similarity between MDPs, hence, many definitions of similarity or its complement distance have been considered. In this paper, we propose a categorization of these metrics and analyze the definitions of similarity proposed so far, taking into account such categorization. We also follow this taxonomy to survey the existing literature, as well as suggesting future directions for the construction of new metrics.",0

"Over the past few years, the use of swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in monitoring and remote area surveillance applications has become widespread thanks to the price reduction and the increased capabilities of drones. The drones in the swarm need to cooperatively explore an unknown area, in order to identify and monitor interesting targets, while minimizing their movements. In this work, we propose a distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach that scales to larger swarms without modifications. The proposed framework relies on the possibility for the UAVs to exchange some information through a communication channel, in order to achieve context-awareness and implicitly coordinate the swarm's actions. Our experiments show that the proposed method can yield effective strategies, which are robust to communication channel impairments, and that can easily deal with non-uniform distributions of targets and obstacles. Moreover, when agents are trained in a specific scenario, they can adapt to a new one with minimal additional training. We also show that our approach achieves better performance compared to a computationally intensive look-ahead heuristic.",0

"Model-based planning holds great promise for improving both sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning (RL). We show that energy-based models (EBMs) are a promising class of models to use for model-based planning. EBMs naturally support inference of intermediate states given start and goal state distributions. We provide an online algorithm to train EBMs while interacting with the environment, and show that EBMs allow for significantly better online learning than corresponding feed-forward networks. We further show that EBMs support maximum entropy state inference and are able to generate diverse state space plans. We show that inference purely in state space - without planning actions - allows for better generalization to previously unseen obstacles in the environment and prevents the planner from exploiting the dynamics model by applying uncharacteristic action sequences. Finally, we show that online EBM training naturally leads to intentionally planned state exploration which performs significantly better than random exploration.",0

"We study the sample complexity of teaching, termed as ""teaching dimension"" (TDim) in the literature, for the teaching-by-reinforcement paradigm, where the teacher guides the student through rewards. This is distinct from the teaching-by-demonstration paradigm motivated by robotics applications, where the teacher teaches by providing demonstrations of state/action trajectories. The teaching-by-reinforcement paradigm applies to a wider range of real-world settings where a demonstration is inconvenient, but has not been studied systematically. In this paper, we focus on a specific family of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning, and characterize the TDim under different teachers with varying control power over the environment, and present matching optimal teaching algorithms.

"In model-based reinforcement learning, planning with an imperfect model of the environment has the potential to harm learning progress. But even when a model is imperfect, it may still contain information that is useful for planning. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using an imperfect model selectively. The agent should plan in parts of the state space where the model would be helpful but refrain from using the model where it would be harmful. An effective selective planning mechanism requires estimating predictive uncertainty, which arises out of aleatoric uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and model inadequacy, among other sources. Prior work has focused on parameter uncertainty for selective planning. In this work, we emphasize the importance of model inadequacy. We show that heteroscedastic regression can signal predictive uncertainty arising from model inadequacy that is complementary to that which is detected by methods designed for parameter uncertainty, indicating that considering both parameter uncertainty and model inadequacy may be a more promising direction for effective selective planning than either in isolation.",0
"The potential negative impact of planning with an imperfect model in model-based reinforcement learning is explored in this paper. Nonetheless, since an imperfect model may still contain useful information for planning, the authors investigate the concept of selective use of such models.

To achieve this, the authors propose an effective selective planning mechanism that involves estimating predictive uncertainty. Predictive uncertainty results from various sources, including aleatoric uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and model inadequacy. While prior research has focused on parameter uncertainty for selective planning, the authors highlight the importance of model inadequacy.

"Some reinforcement learning methods suffer from high sample complexity causing them to not be practical in real-world situations. $Q$-function reuse, a transfer learning method, is one way to reduce the sample complexity of learning, potentially improving usefulness of existing algorithms. Prior work has shown the empirical effectiveness of $Q$-function reuse for various environments when applied to model-free algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no theoretical work showing the regret of $Q$-function reuse when applied to the tabular, model-free setting. We aim to bridge the gap between theoretical and empirical work in $Q$-function reuse by providing some theoretical insights on the effectiveness of $Q$-function reuse when applied to the $Q$-learning with UCB-Hoeffding algorithm. Our main contribution is showing that in a specific case if $Q$-function reuse is applied to the $Q$-learning with UCB-Hoeffding algorithm it has a regret that is independent of the state or action space. We also provide empirical results supporting our theoretical findings.",0

"We propose a simple data augmentation technique that can be applied to standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling robust learning directly from pixels without the need for auxiliary losses or pre-training.

"Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) is a multi-goal reinforcement learning algorithm for sparse reward functions. The algorithm treats every failure as a success for an alternative (virtual) goal that has been achieved in the episode. Virtual goals are randomly selected, irrespective of which are most instructive for the agent. In this paper, we present two improvements over the existing HER algorithm. First, we prioritize virtual goals from which the agent will learn more valuable information. We call this property the instructiveness of the virtual goal and define it by a heuristic measure, which expresses how well the agent will be able to generalize from that virtual goal to actual goals. Secondly, we reduce existing bias in HER by the removal of misleading samples. To test our algorithms, we built two challenging environments with sparse reward functions. Our empirical results in both environments show vast improvement in the final success rate and sample efficiency when compared to the original HER algorithm.

"This paper proposes DeepSynth, a method for effective training of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents when the reward is sparse and non-Markovian, but at the same time progress towards the reward requires achieving an unknown sequence of high-level objectives. Our method employs a novel algorithm for synthesis of compact automata to uncover this sequential structure automatically. We synthesise a human-interpretable automaton from trace data collected by exploring the environment. The state space of the environment is then enriched with the synthesised automaton so that the generation of a control policy by deep RL is guided by the discovered structure encoded in the automaton. The proposed approach is able to cope with both high-dimensional, low-level features and unknown sparse non-Markovian rewards. We have evaluated DeepSynth's performance in a set of experiments that includes the Atari game Montezuma's Revenge.

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has great potential for acquiring the optimal action in complex environments such as games and robot control. However, it is difficult to analyze the decision-making of the agent, i.e., the reasons it selects the action acquired by learning. In this work, we propose Mask-Attention A3C (Mask A3C), which introduces an attention mechanism into Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), which is an actor-critic-based DRL method, and can analyze the decision-making of an agent in DRL. A3C consists of a feature extractor that extracts features from an image, a policy branch that outputs the policy, and a value branch that outputs the state value. In this method, we focus on the policy and value branches and introduce an attention mechanism into them. The attention mechanism applies a mask processing to the feature maps of each branch using mask-attention that expresses the judgment reason for the policy and state value with a heat map. We visualized mask-attention maps for games on the Atari 2600 and found we could easily analyze the reasons behind an agent's decision-making in various game tasks. Furthermore, experimental results showed that the agent could achieve a higher performance by introducing the attention mechanism.",0

"In the standard data analysis framework, data is first collected (once for all), and then data analysis is carried out. With the advancement of digital technology, decisionmakers constantly analyze past data and generate new data through the decisions they make. In this paper, we model this as a Markov decision process and show that the dynamic interaction between data generation and data analysis leads to a new type of bias -- reinforcement bias -- that exacerbates the endogeneity problem in standard data analysis.   We propose a class of instrument variable (IV)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to correct for the bias and establish their asymptotic properties by incorporating them into a two-timescale stochastic approximation framework. A key contribution of the paper is the development of new techniques that allow for the analysis of the algorithms in general settings where noises feature time-dependency.   We use the techniques to derive sharper results on finite-time trajectory stability bounds: with a polynomial rate, the entire future trajectory of the iterates from the algorithm fall within a ball that is centered at the true parameter and is shrinking at a (different) polynomial rate. We also use the technique to provide formulas for inferences that are rarely done for RL algorithms. These formulas highlight how the strength of the IV and the degree of the noise's time dependency affect the inference.",0

"In order to model risk aversion in reinforcement learning, an emerging line of research adapts familiar algorithms to optimize coherent risk functionals, a class that includes conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Because optimizing the coherent risk is difficult in Markov decision processes, recent work tends to focus on the Markov coherent risk (MCR), a time-consistent surrogate. While, policy gradient (PG) updates have been derived for this objective, it remains unclear (i) whether PG finds a global optimum for MCR; (ii) how to estimate the gradient in a tractable manner. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in general, MCR objectives (unlike the expected return) are not gradient dominated and that stationary points are not, in general, guaranteed to be globally optimal. Moreover, we present a tight upper bound on the suboptimality of the learned policy, characterizing its dependence on the nonlinearity of the objective and the degree of risk aversion. Addressing (ii), we propose a practical implementation of PG that uses state distribution reweighting to overcome previous limitations. Through experiments, we demonstrate that when the optimality gap is small, PG can learn risk-sensitive policies. However, we find that instances with large suboptimality gaps are abundant and easy to construct, outlining an important challenge for future research.",0

"We study episodic reinforcement learning in non-stationary linear (a.k.a. low-rank) Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), i.e, both the reward and transition kernel are linear with respect to a given feature map and are allowed to evolve either slowly or abruptly over time. For this problem setting, we propose OPT-WLSVI an optimistic model-free algorithm based on weighted least squares value iteration which uses exponential weights to smoothly forget data that are far in the past.

"In reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, exploratory control inputs are used during learning to acquire knowledge for decision making and control, while the true dynamics of a controlled object is unknown. However, this exploring property sometimes causes undesired situations by violating constraints regarding the state of the controlled object. In this paper, we propose an automatic exploration process adjustment method for safe RL in continuous state and action spaces utilizing a linear nominal model of the controlled object. Specifically, our proposed method automatically selects whether the exploratory input is used or not at each time depending on the state and its predicted value as well as adjusts the variance-covariance matrix used in the Gaussian policy for exploration. We also show that our exploration process adjustment method theoretically guarantees the satisfaction of the constraints with the pre-specified probability, that is, the satisfaction of a joint chance constraint at every time.

The algorithm employs a reinforcement learning agent to iteratively add directed edges to the DAG, one at a time, to enforce ordering (i.e., priorities of execution and resource allocation) of ""tricky"" job nodes. By doing so, the original DAG scheduling problem is dramatically reduced to a much simpler proxy problem, on which heuristic scheduling algorithms such as SJF and CP can be efficiently improved.

"The standard feedback model of reinforcement learning requires revealing the reward of every visited state-action pair. However, in practice, it is often the case that such frequent feedback is not available. In this work, we take a first step towards relaxing this assumption and require a weaker form of feedback, which we refer to as \emph{trajectory feedback}. Instead of observing the reward obtained after every action, we assume we only receive a score that represents the quality of the whole trajectory observed by the agent, namely, the sum of all rewards obtained over this trajectory. We extend reinforcement learning algorithms to this setting, based on least-squares estimation of the unknown reward, for both the known and unknown transition model cases, and study the performance of these algorithms by analyzing their regret. For cases where the transition model is unknown, we offer a hybrid optimistic-Thompson Sampling approach that results in a tractable algorithm.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has made groundbreaking advancements in robotics, data center management and other applications. Unfortunately, system-level bottlenecks in RL workloads are poorly understood; we observe fundamental structural differences in RL workloads that make them inherently less GPU-bound than supervised learning (SL). To explain where training time is spent in RL workloads, we propose RL-Scope, a cross-stack profiler that scopes low-level CPU/GPU resource usage to high-level algorithmic operations, and provides accurate insights by correcting for profiling overhead. Using RL-Scope, we survey RL workloads across its major dimensions including ML backend, RL algorithm, and simulator. For ML backends, we explain a $2.3\times$ difference in runtime between equivalent PyTorch and TensorFlow algorithm implementations, and identify a bottleneck rooted in overly abstracted algorithm implementations. For RL algorithms and simulators, we show that on-policy algorithms are at least $3.5\times$ more simulation-bound than off-policy algorithms. Finally, we profile a scale-up workload and demonstrate that GPU utilization metrics reported by commonly used tools dramatically inflate GPU usage, whereas RL-Scope reports true GPU-bound time.

"We solve a challenging yet practically useful variant of 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). In our problem, the agent has limited information about the items to be packed into the bin, and an item must be packed immediately after its arrival without buffering or readjusting.

It has driven the discovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes, branch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing. The last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where (graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial algorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better heuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is appealing because developing algorithms to tackle efficiently NP-hard problems may require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by nature. In this work, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer architecture originally developed for natural language processing to the combinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without TSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved performances over recent learned heuristics with an optimal gap of 0.004% for TSP50 and 0.39% for TSP100.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its worth in a series of artificial domains, and is beginning to show some successes in real-world scenarios. However, much of the research advances in RL are hard to leverage in real-world systems due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we identify and formalize a series of independent challenges that embody the difficulties that must be addressed for RL to be commonly deployed in real-world systems. For each challenge, we define it formally in the context of a Markov Decision Process, analyze the effects of the challenge on state-of-the-art learning algorithms, and present some existing attempts at tackling it. We believe that an approach that addresses our set of proposed challenges would be readily deployable in a large number of real world problems.

"Recent advances in off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to impressive success in complex tasks from visual observations. Experience replay improves sample-efficiency by reusing experiences from the past, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) process high-dimensional inputs effectively. However, such techniques demand high memory and computational bandwidth. In this paper, we present Stored Embeddings for Efficient Reinforcement Learning (SEER), a simple modification of existing off-policy RL methods, to address these computational and memory requirements. To reduce the computational overhead of gradient updates in CNNs, we freeze the lower layers of CNN encoders early in training due to early convergence of their parameters. Additionally, we reduce memory requirements by storing the low-dimensional latent vectors for experience replay instead of high-dimensional images, enabling an adaptive increase in the replay buffer capacity, a useful technique in constrained-memory settings. In our experiments, we show that SEER does not degrade the performance of RL agents while significantly saving computation and memory across a diverse set of DeepMind Control environments and Atari games. Finally, we show that SEER is useful for computation-efficient transfer learning in RL because lower layers of CNNs extract generalizable features, which can be used for different tasks and domains.",0

"Various methods for solving the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem have been developed independently in machine learning and economics. In particular, the method of Maximum Causal Entropy IRL is based on the perspective of entropy maximization, while related advances in the field of economics instead assume the existence of unobserved action shocks to explain expert behavior (Nested Fixed Point Algorithm, Conditional Choice Probability method, Nested Pseudo-Likelihood Algorithm). In this work, we make previously unknown connections between these related methods from both fields. We achieve this by showing that they all belong to a class of optimization problems, characterized by a common form of the objective, the associated policy and the objective gradient. We demonstrate key computational and algorithmic differences which arise between the methods due to an approximation of the optimal soft value function, and describe how this leads to more efficient algorithms.

"We present a neural optimization model trained with reinforcement learning to solve the coordinate ordering problem for sets of star glyphs. Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes. We also demonstrate that our model can be adapted to coordinate ordering of other types of plots such as RadViz by replacing the proposed shape-aware silhouette coefficient with the corresponding quality metric to guide network training.",0

"MuZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a value equivalent dynamics model, achieved state-of-the-art performance in Chess, Shogi and the game of Go. In contrast to standard forward dynamics models that predict a full next state, value equivalent models are trained to predict a future value, thereby emphasizing value relevant information in the representations. While value equivalent models have shown strong empirical success, there is no research yet that visualizes and investigates what types of representations these models actually learn. Therefore, in this paper we visualize the latent representation of MuZero agents. We find that action trajectories may diverge between observation embeddings and internal state transition dynamics, which could lead to instability during planning. Based on this insight, we propose two regularization techniques to stabilize MuZero's performance. Additionally, we provide an open-source implementation of MuZero along with an interactive visualizer of learned representations, which may aid further investigation of value equivalent algorithms.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective in a wide range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from severe action oscillations in particular in discrete action setting, which means that agents select different actions within consecutive steps even though states only slightly differ. This issue is often neglected since the policy is usually evaluated by its cumulative rewards only. Action oscillation strongly affects the user experience and can even cause serious potential security menace especially in real-world domains with the main concern of safety, such as autonomous driving. To this end, we introduce Policy Inertia Controller (PIC) which serves as a generic plug-in framework to off-the-shelf DRL algorithms, to enables adaptive trade-off between the optimality and smoothness of the learned policy in a formal way. We propose Nested Policy Iteration as a general training algorithm for PIC-augmented policy which ensures monotonically non-decreasing updates under some mild conditions. Further, we derive a practical DRL algorithm, namely Nested Soft Actor-Critic. Experiments on a collection of autonomous driving tasks and several Atari games suggest that our approach demonstrates substantial oscillation reduction in comparison to a range of commonly adopted baselines with almost no performance degradation.",0

"Value function is the central notion of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Value estimation, especially with function approximation, can be challenging since it involves the stochasticity of environmental dynamics and reward signals that can be sparse and delayed in some cases. A typical model-free RL algorithm usually estimates the values of a policy by Temporal Difference (TD) or Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms directly from rewards, without explicitly taking dynamics into consideration. In this paper, we propose Value Decomposition with Future Prediction (VDFP), providing an explicit two-step understanding of the value estimation process: 1) first foresee the latent future, 2) and then evaluate it. We analytically decompose the value function into a latent future dynamics part and a policy-independent trajectory return part, inducing a way to model latent dynamics and returns separately in value estimation. Further, we derive a practical deep RL algorithm, consisting of a convolutional model to learn compact trajectory representation from past experiences, a conditional variational auto-encoder to predict the latent future dynamics and a convex return model that evaluates trajectory representation. In experiments, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for both off-policy and on-policy RL in several OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks as well as a few challenging variants with delayed reward.",0

"At the working heart of policy iteration algorithms commonly used and studied in the discounted setting of reinforcement learning, the policy evaluation step estimates the value of states with samples from a Markov reward process induced by following a Markov policy in a Markov decision process. We propose a simple and efficient estimator called loop estimator that exploits the regenerative structure of Markov reward processes without explicitly estimating a full model. Our method enjoys a space complexity of $O(1)$ when estimating the value of a single positive recurrent state $s$ unlike TD with $O(S)$ or model-based methods with $O\left(S^2\right)$. Moreover, the regenerative structure enables us to show, without relying on the generative model approach, that the estimator has an instance-dependent convergence rate of $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\tau_s/T}\right)$ over steps $T$ on a single sample path, where $\tau_s$ is the maximal expected hitting time to state $s$. In preliminary numerical experiments, the loop estimator outperforms model-free methods, such as TD(k), and is competitive with the model-based estimator.",0

"Automated neural network design has received ever-increasing attention with the evolution of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially involving their deployment on embedded and mobile platforms. One of the biggest problems that neural architecture search (NAS) confronts is that a large number of candidate neural architectures are required to train, using, for instance, reinforcement learning and evolutionary optimisation algorithms, at a vast computation cost. Even recent differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) samples a small number of candidate neural architectures based on the probability distribution of learned architecture parameters to select the final neural architecture. To address this computational complexity issue, we introduce a novel \emph{architecture parameterisation} based on scaled sigmoid function, and propose a general \emph{Differentiable Neural Architecture Learning} (DNAL) method to optimize the neural architecture without the need to evaluate candidate neural networks. Specifically, for stochastic supernets as well as conventional CNNs, we build a new channel-wise module layer with the architecture components controlled by a scaled sigmoid function. We train these neural network models from scratch. The network optimization is decoupled into the weight optimization and the architecture optimization. We address the non-convex optimization problem of neural architecture by the continuous scaled sigmoid method with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate our DNAL method delivers superior performance in terms of neural architecture search cost. The optimal networks learned by DNAL surpass those produced by the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K dataset in accuracy, model size and computational complexity.",0

"Learning to autonomously navigate the web is a difficult sequential decision making task. The state and action spaces are large and combinatorial in nature, and websites are dynamic environments consisting of several pages. One of the bottlenecks of training web navigation agents is providing a learnable curriculum of training environments that can cover the large variety of real-world websites. Therefore, we propose using Adversarial Environment Generation (AEG) to generate challenging web environments in which to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents. We provide a new benchmarking environment, gMiniWoB, which enables an RL adversary to use compositional primitives to learn to generate arbitrarily complex websites. To train the adversary, we propose a new technique for maximizing regret using the difference in the scores obtained by a pair of navigator agents. Our results show that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods for minimax regret AEG. The regret objective trains the adversary to design a curriculum of environments that are ""just-the-right-challenge"" for the navigator agents; our results show that over time, the adversary learns to generate increasingly complex web navigation tasks.

"Modern day computing increasingly relies on specialization to satiate growing performance and efficiency requirements. A core challenge in designing such specialized hardware architectures is how to perform mapping space search, i.e., search for an optimal mapping from algorithm to hardware. Prior work shows that choosing an inefficient mapping can lead to multiplicative-factor efficiency overheads. Additionally, the search space is not only large but also non-convex and non-smooth, precluding advanced search techniques. As a result, previous works are forced to implement mapping space search using expert choices or sub-optimal search heuristics.   This work proposes Mind Mappings, a novel gradient-based search method for algorithm-accelerator mapping space search. The key idea is to derive a smooth, differentiable approximation to the otherwise non-smooth, non-convex search space. With a smooth, differentiable approximation, we can leverage efficient gradient-based search algorithms to find high-quality mappings. We extensively compare Mind Mappings to black-box optimization schemes used in prior work. When tasked to find mappings for two important workloads (CNN and MTTKRP), the proposed search finds mappings that achieve an average $1.40\times$, $1.76\times$, and $1.29\times$ (when run for a fixed number of steps) and $3.16\times$, $4.19\times$, and $2.90\times$ (when run for a fixed amount of time) better energy-delay product (EDP) relative to Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning, respectively. Meanwhile, Mind Mappings returns mappings with only $5.32\times$ higher EDP than a possibly unachievable theoretical lower-bound, indicating proximity to the global optima.",0

"In offline reinforcement learning (RL), the goal is to learn a highly rewarding policy based solely on a dataset of historical interactions with the environment. The ability to train RL policies offline can greatly expand the applicability of RL, its data efficiency, and its experimental velocity. Prior work in offline RL has been confined almost exclusively to model-free RL approaches. In this work, we present MOReL, an algorithmic framework for model-based offline RL. This framework consists of two steps: (a) learning a pessimistic MDP (P-MDP) using the offline dataset; and (b) learning a near-optimal policy in this P-MDP. The learned P-MDP has the property that for any policy, the performance in the real environment is approximately lower-bounded by the performance in the P-MDP. This enables it to serve as a good surrogate for purposes of policy evaluation and learning, and overcome common pitfalls of model-based RL like model exploitation. Theoretically, we show that MOReL is minimax optimal (up to log factors) for offline RL. Through experiments, we show that MOReL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art results in widely studied offline RL benchmarks. Moreover, the modular design of MOReL enables future advances in its components (e.g. generative modeling, uncertainty estimation, planning etc.) to directly translate into advances for offline RL.",0

"Large-scale finite element simulations of complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations crucially depend on adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to allocate computational budget to regions where higher resolution is required. Existing scalable AMR methods make heuristic refinement decisions based on instantaneous error estimation and thus do not aim for long-term optimality over an entire simulation. We propose a novel formulation of AMR as a Markov decision process and apply deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train refinement policies directly from simulation. AMR poses a new problem for RL in that both the state dimension and available action set changes at every step, which we solve by proposing new policy architectures with differing generality and inductive bias. The model sizes of these policy architectures are independent of the mesh size and hence scale to arbitrarily large and complex simulations. We demonstrate in comprehensive experiments on static function estimation and the advection of different fields that RL policies can be competitive with a widely-used error estimator and generalize to larger, more complex, and unseen test problems.",0

Our experiments on static function estimation and the advection of different fields demonstrate that RL policies can compete with widely-used error estimators and generalize to larger, more complex, and unseen test problems.",1
"We propose UCBMQ, Upper Confidence Bound Momentum Q-learning, a new algorithm for reinforcement learning in tabular and possibly stage-dependent, episodic Markov decision process. UCBMQ is based on Q-learning where we add a momentum term and rely on the principle of optimism in face of uncertainty to deal with exploration. Our new technical ingredient of UCBMQ is the use of momentum to correct the bias that Q-learning suffers while, at the same time, limiting the impact it has on the second-order term of the regret. For UCBMQ , we are able to guarantee a regret of at most $O(\sqrt{H^3SAT}+ H^4 S A )$ where $H$ is the length of an episode, $S$ the number of states, $A$ the number of actions, $T$ the number of episodes and ignoring terms in poly$log(SAHT)$. Notably, UCBMQ is the first algorithm that simultaneously matches the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$ for large enough $T$ and has a second-order term (with respect to the horizon $T$) that scales only linearly with the number of states $S$.",0

"Many physical systems have underlying safety considerations that require that the policy employed ensures the satisfaction of a set of constraints. The analytical formulation usually takes the form of a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We focus on the case where the CMDP is unknown, and RL algorithms obtain samples to discover the model and compute an optimal constrained policy. Our goal is to characterize the relationship between safety constraints and the number of samples needed to ensure a desired level of accuracy -- both objective maximization and constraint satisfaction -- in a PAC sense. We explore two classes of RL algorithms, namely, (i) a generative model based approach, wherein samples are taken initially to estimate a model, and (ii) an online approach, wherein the model is updated as samples are obtained. Our main finding is that compared to the best known bounds of the unconstrained regime, the sample complexity of constrained RL algorithms are increased by a factor that is logarithmic in the number of constraints, which suggests that the approach may be easily utilized in real systems.",0

"Event-based cameras are dynamic vision sensors that can provide asynchronous measurements of changes in per-pixel brightness at a microsecond level. This makes them significantly faster than conventional frame-based cameras, and an appealing choice for high-speed navigation. While an interesting sensor modality, this asynchronous data poses a challenge for common machine learning techniques. In this paper, we present an event variational autoencoder for unsupervised representation learning from asynchronous event camera data. We show that it is feasible to learn compact representations from spatiotemporal event data to encode the context. Furthermore, we show that such pretrained representations can be beneficial for navigation, allowing for usage in reinforcement learning instead of end-to-end reward driven perception. We validate this framework of learning visuomotor policies by applying it to an obstacle avoidance scenario in simulation. We show that representations learnt from event data enable training fast control policies that can adapt to different control capacities, and demonstrate a higher degree of robustness than end-to-end learning from event images.",0

"We consider the problem of learning to communicate using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). A common approach is to learn off-policy, using data sampled from a replay buffer. However, messages received in the past may not accurately reflect the current communication policy of each agent, and this complicates learning. We therefore introduce a 'communication correction' which accounts for the non-stationarity of observed communication induced by multi-agent learning. It works by relabelling the received message to make it likely under the communicator's current policy, and thus be a better reflection of the receiver's current environment. To account for cases in which agents are both senders and receivers, we introduce an ordered relabelling scheme. Our correction is computationally efficient and can be integrated with a range of off-policy algorithms. We find in our experiments that it substantially improves the ability of communicating MARL systems to learn across a variety of cooperative and competitive tasks.",0

"Visual navigation is often cast as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Current methods typically result in a suboptimal policy that learns general obstacle avoidance and search behaviours. For example, in the target-object navigation setting, the policies learnt by traditional methods often fail to complete the task, even when the target is clearly within reach from a human perspective. In order to address this issue, we propose to learn to imagine a latent representation of the successful (sub-)goal state. To do so, we have developed a module which we call Foresight Imagination (ForeSIT). ForeSIT is trained to imagine the recurrent latent representation of a future state that leads to success, e.g. either a sub-goal state that is important to reach before the target, or the goal state itself. By conditioning the policy on the generated imagination during training, our agent learns how to use this imagination to achieve its goal robustly. Our agent is able to imagine what the (sub-)goal state may look like (in the latent space) and can learn to navigate towards that state. We develop an efficient learning algorithm to train ForeSIT in an on-policy manner and integrate it into our RL objective. The integration is not trivial due to the constantly evolving state representation shared between both the imagination and the policy. We, empirically, observe that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the commonly accepted benchmark AI2THOR environment. Our method can be readily integrated or added to other model-free RL navigation frameworks.",0

"How do you incentivize self-interested agents to $\textit{explore}$ when they prefer to $\textit{exploit}$ ? We consider complex exploration problems, where each agent faces the same (but unknown) MDP. In contrast with traditional formulations of reinforcement learning, agents control the choice of policies, whereas an algorithm can only issue recommendations. However, the algorithm controls the flow of information, and can incentivize the agents to explore via information asymmetry. We design an algorithm which explores all reachable states in the MDP. We achieve provable guarantees similar to those for incentivizing exploration in static, stateless exploration problems studied previously.",0
"The challenge is to encourage self-interested agents to engage in exploration when their preference is to exploit. Our focus is on intricate exploration problems where every agent confronts the same MDP whose specifics are unknown. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning, agents determine policy selection while an algorithm only provides suggestions. Yet, the algorithm regulates the information flow and can motivate exploration by introducing information asymmetry. Our algorithm is designed to explore all MDP states that can be reached. We are able to deliver verifiable assurances that are comparable to those obtained for encouraging exploration in static, stateless exploration problems studied previously.",1
"For real-time semantic video segmentation, most recent works utilised a dynamic framework with a key scheduler to make online key/non-key decisions. Some works used a fixed key scheduling policy, while others proposed adaptive key scheduling methods based on heuristic strategies, both of which may lead to suboptimal global performance. To overcome this limitation, we model the online key decision process in dynamic video segmentation as a deep reinforcement learning problem and learn an efficient and effective scheduling policy from expert information about decision history and from the process of maximising global return. Moreover, we study the application of dynamic video segmentation on face videos, a field that has not been investigated before. By evaluating on the 300VW dataset, we show that the performance of our reinforcement key scheduler outperforms that of various baselines in terms of both effective key selections and running speed. Further results on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can also generalise to other scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use reinforcement learning for online key-frame decision in dynamic video segmentation, and also the first work on its application on face videos.",0

"The objective of most Reinforcement Learning painting agents is to minimize the loss between a target image and the paint canvas. Human painter artistry emphasizes important features of the target image rather than simply reproducing it (DiPaola 2007). Using adversarial or L2 losses in the RL painting models, although its final output is generally a work of finesse, produces a stroke sequence that is vastly different from that which a human would produce since the model does not have knowledge about the abstract features in the target image. In order to increase the human-like planning of the model without the use of expensive human data, we introduce a new loss function for use with the model's reward function: Content Masked Loss. In the context of robot painting, Content Masked Loss employs an object detection model to extract features which are used to assign higher weight to regions of the canvas that a human would find important for recognizing content. The results, based on 332 human evaluators, show that the digital paintings produced by our Content Masked model show detectable subject matter earlier in the stroke sequence than existing methods without compromising on the quality of the final painting. Our code is available at https://github.com/pschaldenbrand/ContentMaskedLoss.",0
"Most Reinforcement Learning painting agents aim to minimize the loss between a paint canvas and a target image.

"Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) aims to learn from multiple training tasks the ability to adapt efficiently to unseen test tasks. Despite the success, existing meta-RL algorithms are known to be sensitive to the task distribution shift. When the test task distribution is different from the training task distribution, the performance may degrade significantly. To address this issue, this paper proposes Model-based Adversarial Meta-Reinforcement Learning (AdMRL), where we aim to minimize the worst-case sub-optimality gap -- the difference between the optimal return and the return that the algorithm achieves after adaptation -- across all tasks in a family of tasks, with a model-based approach. We propose a minimax objective and optimize it by alternating between learning the dynamics model on a fixed task and finding the adversarial task for the current model -- the task for which the policy induced by the model is maximally suboptimal. Assuming the family of tasks is parameterized, we derive a formula for the gradient of the suboptimality with respect to the task parameters via the implicit function theorem, and show how the gradient estimator can be efficiently implemented by the conjugate gradient method and a novel use of the REINFORCE estimator. We evaluate our approach on several continuous control benchmarks and demonstrate its efficacy in the worst-case performance over all tasks, the generalization power to out-of-distribution tasks, and in training and test time sample efficiency, over existing state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms.",0

"Action advising is a budget-constrained knowledge exchange mechanism between teacher-student peers that can help tackle exploration and sample inefficiency problems in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Most recently, student-initiated techniques that utilise state novelty and uncertainty estimations have obtained promising results. However, the approaches built on these estimations have some potential weaknesses. First, they assume that the convergence of the student's RL model implies less need for advice. This can be misleading in scenarios with teacher absence early on where the student is likely to learn suboptimally by itself; yet also ignore the teacher's assistance later. Secondly, the delays between encountering states and having them to take effect in the RL model updates in presence of the experience replay dynamics cause a feedback lag in what the student actually needs advice for. We propose a student-initiated algorithm that alleviates these by employing Random Network Distillation (RND) to measure the novelty of a piece of advice. Furthermore, we perform RND updates only for the advised states to ensure that the student's own learning does not impair its ability to leverage the teacher. Experiments in GridWorld and MinAtar show that our approach performs on par with the state-of-the-art and demonstrates significant advantages in the scenarios where the existing methods are prone to fail.",0

"Off-policy multi-step reinforcement learning algorithms consist of conservative and non-conservative algorithms: the former actively cut traces, whereas the latter do not. Recently, Munos et al. (2016) proved the convergence of conservative algorithms to an optimal Q-function. In contrast, non-conservative algorithms are thought to be unsafe and have a limited or no theoretical guarantee. Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that non-conservative algorithms empirically outperform conservative ones. Motivated by the empirical results and the lack of theory, we carry out theoretical analyses of Peng's Q($\lambda$), a representative example of non-conservative algorithms. We prove that it also converges to an optimal policy provided that the behavior policy slowly tracks a greedy policy in a way similar to conservative policy iteration. Such a result has been conjectured to be true but has not been proven. We also experiment with Peng's Q($\lambda$) in complex continuous control tasks, confirming that Peng's Q($\lambda$) often outperforms conservative algorithms despite its simplicity. These results indicate that Peng's Q($\lambda$), which was thought to be unsafe, is a theoretically-sound and practically effective algorithm.",0

"In offline reinforcement learning, a policy learns to maximize cumulative rewards with a fixed collection of data. Towards conservative strategy, current methods choose to regularize the behavior policy or learn a lower bound of the value function. However, exorbitant conservation tends to impair the policy's generalization ability and degrade its performance, especially for the mixed datasets. In this paper, we propose the method of reducing conservativeness oriented reinforcement learning. On the one hand, the policy is trained to pay more attention to the minority samples in the static dataset to address the data imbalance problem. On the other hand, we give a tighter lower bound of value function than previous methods to discover potential optimal actions. Consequently, our proposed method is able to tackle the skewed distribution of the provided dataset and derive a value function closer to the expected value function. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in D4RL offline reinforcement learning evaluation tasks and our own designed mixed datasets.",0
"The process of offline reinforcement learning involves a policy that strives to maximize rewards using a fixed set of data.

However, excessive conservatism can negatively impact the policy's overall performance and ability to generalize, particularly when dealing with mixed datasets. This research introduces a less conservative approach to reinforcement learning. Firstly, we teach the policy to concentrate more on minority samples within the static dataset to tackle the issue of imbalanced data. Secondly, we offer a more precise lower limit for the value function than previous methods to identify potential optimal actions.

"A grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration, especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall. On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic motivation, which is the dominant method to improve performance on hard-exploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma's Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of ""superhuman"" performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable hard-exploration problems in many domains, especially those that harness a simulator during training (e.g. robotics).",0

"Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) is a promising framework for learning control in a data-efficient manner. MBRL algorithms can be fairly complex due to the separate dynamics modeling and the subsequent planning algorithm, and as a result, they often possess tens of hyperparameters and architectural choices. For this reason, MBRL typically requires significant human expertise before it can be applied to new problems and domains. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO). We demonstrate that this problem can be tackled effectively with automated HPO, which we demonstrate to yield significantly improved performance compared to human experts. In addition, we show that tuning of several MBRL hyperparameters dynamically, i.e. during the training itself, further improves the performance compared to using static hyperparameters which are kept fixed for the whole training. Finally, our experiments provide valuable insights into the effects of several hyperparameters, such as plan horizon or learning rate and their influence on the stability of training and resulting rewards.",0

"In reinforcement learning, robust policies for high-stakes decision-making problems with limited data are usually computed by optimizing the percentile criterion, which minimizes the probability of a catastrophic failure. Unfortunately, such policies are typically overly conservative as the percentile criterion is non-convex, difficult to optimize, and ignores the mean performance. To overcome these shortcomings, we study the soft-robust criterion, which uses risk measures to balance the mean and percentile criterion better. In this paper, we establish the soft-robust criterion's fundamental properties, show that it is NP-hard to optimize, and propose and analyze two algorithms to approximately optimize it. Our theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithms compute much less conservative solutions than the existing approximate methods for optimizing the percentile-criterion.",0
"The process of reinforcement learning involves creating strong policies for making high-stakes decisions with limited data.

To address these issues, we explore the soft-robust criterion, which incorporates risk measures to more effectively balance the mean and percentile criteria. Our research delves into the core features of the soft-robust criterion, demonstrates that it is challenging to optimize, and proposes two algorithms for approximating the optimal solution.

"Safety in reinforcement learning (RL) is a key property in both training and execution in many domains such as autonomous driving or finance.

To ensure safety during learning, we extend a safe policy optimization method to solve our problem. The distributional RL perspective leads to a more efficient algorithm while additionally catering for natural safe constraints. We empirically validate our propositions on artificial and real domains against appropriate state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms.",0

"In federated learning (FL), fair and accurate measurement of the contribution of each federated participant is of great significance. The level of contribution not only provides a rational metric for distributing financial benefits among federated participants, but also helps to discover malicious participants that try to poison the FL framework. Previous methods for contribution measurement were based on enumeration over possible combination of federated participants. Their computation costs increase drastically with the number of participants or feature dimensions, making them inapplicable in practical situations. In this paper an efficient method is proposed to evaluate the contributions of federated participants. This paper focuses on the horizontal FL framework, where client servers calculate parameter gradients over their local data, and upload the gradients to the central server.

"The precise and unbiased measurement of each participant's contribution is crucial in federated learning (FL). It not only serves as a fair basis for distributing financial benefits, but also enables the detection of any malicious activity aimed at sabotaging the FL framework. The existing approaches for measuring contribution rely on an exhaustive enumeration of all possible combinations of participants, which becomes impractical with an increase in the number of participants or feature dimensions. Therefore, this paper presents a more efficient method for evaluating the contributions of federated participants. Specifically, it focuses on the horizontal FL framework, where client servers calculate parameter gradients over their local data and upload them to the central server for aggregation. To achieve this, the central server trains a data value estimator of the gradients using reinforcement learning techniques. The experimental results show that this method consistently outperforms the conventional leave-one-out method both in terms of valuation authenticity and time complexity.",1
"Heterogeneous ensembles that can aggregate an unrestricted number and variety of base predictors can effectively address challenging prediction problems. In particular, accurate ensembles that are also parsimonious, i.e., consist of as few base predictors as possible, can help reveal potentially useful knowledge about the target problem domain. Although ensemble selection offers a potential approach to achieving these goals, the currently available algorithms are limited in their abilities. In this paper, we present several algorithms that incorporate ensemble diversity into a reinforcement learning (RL)-based ensemble selection framework to build accurate and parsimonious ensembles. These algorithms, as well as several baselines, are rigorously evaluated on datasets from diverse domains in terms of the predictive performance and parsimony of their ensembles. This evaluation demonstrates that our diversity-incorporated RL-based algorithms perform better than the others for constructing simultaneously accurate and parsimonious ensembles. These algorithms can eventually aid the interpretation or reverse engineering of predictive models assimilated into effective ensembles. To enable such a translation, an implementation of these algorithms, as well the experimental setup they are evaluated in, has been made available at https://github.com/GauravPandeyLab/lens-learning-ensembles-using-reinforcement-learning.",0

"Heterogeneous ensembles built from the predictions of a wide variety and large number of diverse base predictors represent a potent approach to building predictive models for problems where the ideal base/individual predictor may not be obvious. Ensemble selection is an especially promising approach here, not only for improving prediction performance, but also because of its ability to select a collectively predictive subset, often a relatively small one, of the base predictors. In this paper, we present a set of algorithms that explicitly incorporate ensemble diversity, a known factor influencing predictive performance of ensembles, into a reinforcement learning framework for ensemble selection. We rigorously tested these approaches on several challenging problems and associated data sets, yielding that several of them produced more accurate ensembles than those that don't explicitly consider diversity. More importantly, these diversity-incorporating ensembles were much smaller in size, i.e., more parsimonious, than the latter types of ensembles. This can eventually aid the interpretation or reverse engineering of predictive models assimilated into the resultant ensemble(s).",0

This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for ensemble selection that incorporates diversity as a factor in predicting performance. Our experimental results show that ensembles with explicit diversity consideration are more accurate and parsimonious than those without. This can facilitate the interpretation and reverse engineering of the predictive models used in the ensembles.",1
"We address the problem of computing reliable policies in reinforcement learning problems with limited data. In particular, we compute policies that achieve good returns with high confidence when deployed. This objective, known as the \emph{percentile criterion}, can be optimized using Robust MDPs~(RMDPs). RMDPs generalize MDPs to allow for uncertain transition probabilities chosen adversarially from given ambiguity sets. We show that the RMDP solution's sub-optimality depends on the spans of the ambiguity sets along the value function. We then propose new algorithms that minimize the span of ambiguity sets defined by weighted $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ norms. Our primary focus is on Bayesian guarantees, but we also describe how our methods apply to frequentist guarantees and derive new concentration inequalities for weighted $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ norms. Experimental results indicate that our optimized ambiguity sets improve significantly on prior construction methods.",0

"""Nonstationarity"" is a fundamental problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). It results from every agent's policy changing during learning, while being part of the environment from the perspective of other agents. This causes information to inherently oscillate between agents during learning, greatly slowing convergence. We use the MAILP model of information transfer during multi-agent learning to show that increasing centralization during learning arbitrarily mitigates the slowing of convergence due to nonstationarity. The most centralized case of learning is parameter sharing, an uncommonly used MARL method, specific to environments with homogeneous agents. It bootstraps single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) methods and learns an identical policy for each agent. We experimentally replicate our theoretical result of increased learning centralization leading to better performance. We further apply parameter sharing to 8 more modern single-agent deep RL methods for the first time, achieving up to 44 times more average reward in 16% as many episodes compared to previous parameter sharing experiments. We finally give a formal proof of a set of methods that allow parameter sharing to serve in environments with heterogeneous agents.",0

"We propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm derived from a regularized linear-programming formulation of optimal control in MDPs. The method is closely related to the classic Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS) algorithm of Peters et al. (2010), with the key difference that our method introduces a Q-function that enables efficient exact model-free implementation. The main feature of our algorithm (called QREPS) is a convex loss function for policy evaluation that serves as a theoretically sound alternative to the widely used squared Bellman error. We provide a practical saddle-point optimization method for minimizing this loss function and provide an error-propagation analysis that relates the quality of the individual updates to the performance of the output policy.

"Learning from Observations (LfO) is a practical reinforcement learning scenario from which many applications can benefit through the reuse of incomplete resources. Compared to conventional imitation learning (IL), LfO is more challenging because of the lack of expert action guidance. In both conventional IL and LfO, distribution matching is at the heart of their foundation. Traditional distribution matching approaches are sample-costly which depend on on-policy transitions for policy learning. Towards sample-efficiency, some off-policy solutions have been proposed, which, however, either lack comprehensive theoretical justifications or depend on the guidance of expert actions. In this work, we propose a sample-efficient LfO approach that enables off-policy optimization in a principled manner. To further accelerate the learning procedure, we regulate the policy update with an inverse action model, which assists distribution matching from the perspective of mode-covering. Extensive empirical results on challenging locomotion tasks indicate that our approach is comparable with state-of-the-art in terms of both sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning primarily focuses on learning behavior, usually overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form. So, how should one go about finding a morphology fit for solving tasks in a given environment? Current approaches that co-adapt morphology and behavior use a specific task's reward as a signal for morphology optimization. However, this often requires expensive policy optimization and results in task-dependent morphologies that are not built to generalize. In this work, we propose a new approach, Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution (TAME), to alleviate both of these issues. Without any task or reward specification, TAME evolves morphologies by only applying randomly sampled action primitives on a population of agents. This is accomplished using an information-theoretic objective that efficiently ranks agents by their ability to reach diverse states in the environment and the causality of their actions. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that across 2D, 3D, and manipulation environments TAME can evolve morphologies that match the multi-task performance of those learned with task supervised algorithms.

"Current work in explainable reinforcement learning generally produces policies in the form of a decision tree over the state space. Such policies can be used for formal safety verification, agent behavior prediction, and manual inspection of important features. However, existing approaches fit a decision tree after training or use a custom learning procedure which is not compatible with new learning techniques, such as those which use neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) type for learning decision tree policies: Iterative Bounding MDPs (IBMDPs). An IBMDP is constructed around a base MDP so each IBMDP policy is guaranteed to correspond to a decision tree policy for the base MDP when using a method-agnostic masking procedure. Because of this decision tree equivalence, any function approximator can be used during training, including a neural network, while yielding a decision tree policy for the base MDP. We present the required masking procedure as well as a modified value update step which allows IBMDPs to be solved using existing algorithms. We apply this procedure to produce IBMDP variants of recent reinforcement learning methods. We empirically show the benefits of our approach by solving IBMDPs to produce decision tree policies for the base MDPs.",0

"A growing body of research suggests that embodied gameplay, prevalent not just in human cultures but across a variety of animal species including turtles and ravens, is critical in developing the neural flexibility for creative problem solving, decision making, and socialization. Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of embodied gameplay upon artificial agents. While recent work has produced agents proficient in abstract games, these environments are far removed from the real world and thus these agents can provide little insight into the advantages of embodied play.

Here we are the first to show that embodied adversarial reinforcement learning agents playing Cache, a variant of hide-and-seek, in a high fidelity, interactive, environment, learn generalizable representations of their observations encoding information such as object permanence, free space, and containment. Moving closer to biologically motivated learning strategies, our agents' representations, enhanced by intentionality and memory, are developed through interaction and play. These results serve as a model for studying how facets of vision develop through interaction, provide an experimental framework for assessing what is learned by artificial agents, and demonstrates the value of moving from large, static, datasets towards experiential, interactive, representation learning.",0

"Sequential decision making, commonly formalized as Markov Decision Process (MDP) optimization, is a key challenge in artificial intelligence.

First, we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability, and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning, what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two section, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of model-based RL, like enhanced data efficiency, targeted exploration, and improved stability. The survey also draws connection to several related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer.

"Despite its experimental success, Model-based Reinforcement Learning still lacks a complete theoretical understanding. To this end, we analyze the error in the cumulative reward using a contraction approach. We consider both stochastic and deterministic state transitions for continuous (non-discrete) state and action spaces. This approach doesn't require strong assumptions and can recover the typical quadratic error to the horizon. We prove that branched rollouts can reduce this error and are essential for deterministic transitions to have a Bellman contraction. Our analysis of policy mismatch error also applies to Imitation Learning. In this case, we show that GAN-type learning has an advantage over Behavioral Cloning when its discriminator is well-trained.",0

"Reinforcement learning algorithms typically assume rewards to be sampled from light-tailed distributions, such as Gaussian or bounded. However, a wide variety of real-world systems generate rewards that follow heavy-tailed distributions. We consider such scenarios in the setting of undiscounted reinforcement learning. By constructing a lower bound, we show that the difficulty of learning heavy-tailed rewards asymptotically dominates the difficulty of learning transition probabilities. Leveraging techniques from robust mean estimation, we propose Heavy-UCRL2 and Heavy-Q-Learning, and show that they achieve near-optimal regret bounds in this setting. Our algorithms also naturally generalize to deep reinforcement learning applications; we instantiate Heavy-DQN as an example of this.

"Safety is a critical feature of controller design for physical systems. When designing control policies, several approaches to guarantee this aspect of autonomy have been proposed, such as robust controllers or control barrier functions. However, these solutions strongly rely on the model of the system being available to the designer. As a parallel development, reinforcement learning provides model-agnostic control solutions but in general, it lacks the theoretical guarantees required for safety. Recent advances show that under mild conditions, control policies can be learned via reinforcement learning, which can be guaranteed to be safe by imposing these requirements as constraints of an optimization problem. However, to transfer from learning safety to learning safely, there are two hurdles that need to be overcome: (i) it has to be possible to learn the policy without having to re-initialize the system; and (ii) the rollouts of the system need to be in themselves safe. In this paper, we tackle the first issue, proposing an algorithm capable of operating in the continuing task setting without the need of restarts. We evaluate our approach in a numerical example, which shows the capabilities of the proposed approach in learning safe policies via safe exploration.",0

"For many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, specifying a reward is difficult. In this paper, we consider an RL setting where the agent can obtain information about the reward only by querying an expert that can, for example, evaluate individual states or provide binary preferences over trajectories. From such expensive feedback, we aim to learn a model of the reward function that allows standard RL algorithms to achieve high expected return with as few expert queries as possible. For this purpose, we propose Information Directed Reward Learning (IDRL), which uses a Bayesian model of the reward function and selects queries that maximize the information gain about the difference in return between potentially optimal policies. In contrast to prior active reward learning methods designed for specific types of queries, IDRL naturally accommodates different query types. Moreover, by shifting the focus from reducing the reward approximation error to improving the policy induced by the reward model, it achieves similar or better performance with significantly fewer queries. We support our findings with extensive evaluations in multiple environments and with different types of queries.",0

"Since the earliest days of reinforcement learning, the workhorse method for assigning credit to actions over time has been temporal-difference (TD) learning, which propagates credit backward timestep-by-timestep. This approach suffers when delays between actions and rewards are long and when intervening unrelated events contribute variance to long-term returns. We propose state-associative (SA) learning, where the agent learns associations between states and arbitrarily distant future rewards, then propagates credit directly between the two. In this work, we use SA-learning to model the contribution of past states to the current reward. With this model we can predict each state's contribution to the far future, a quantity we call ""synthetic returns"". TD-learning can then be applied to select actions that maximize these synthetic returns (SRs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of augmenting agents with SRs across a range of tasks on which TD-learning alone fails. We show that the learned SRs are interpretable: they spike for states that occur after critical actions are taken. Finally, we show that our IMPALA-based SR agent solves Atari Skiing -- a game with a lengthy reward delay that posed a major hurdle to deep-RL agents -- 25 times faster than the published state-of-the-art.",0

"Recent reinforcement learning studies extensively explore the interplay between cooperative and competitive behaviour in mixed environments. Unlike cooperative environments where agents strive towards a common goal, mixed environments are notorious for the conflicts of selfish and social interests. As a consequence, purely rational agents often struggle to achieve and maintain cooperation. A prevalent approach to induce cooperative behaviour is to assign additional rewards based on other agents' well-being. However, this approach suffers from the issue of multi-agent credit assignment, which can hinder performance. This issue is efficiently alleviated in cooperative setting with such state-of-the-art algorithms as QMIX and COMA. Still, when applied to mixed environments, these algorithms may result in unfair allocation of rewards. We propose BAROCCO, an extension of these algorithms capable to balance individual and social incentives. The mechanism behind BAROCCO is to train two distinct but interwoven components that jointly affect each agent's decisions. Our meta-algorithm is compatible with both Q-learning and Actor-Critic frameworks. We experimentally confirm the advantages over the existing methods and explore the behavioural aspects of BAROCCO in two mixed multi-agent setups.",0

"Reward decomposition is a critical problem in centralized training with decentralized execution~(CTDE) paradigm for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

The excitation signal for learning global hierarchy is deduced from the episode reward difference between before and after ""exercise updates"" through the utility network. Our method is generally applicable to the CTDE method using a monotonic mixing network. Experiments on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark demonstrate that our method just with a simple utility network is able to outperform the current state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on 4 of 5 super hard scenarios. Better performance can be further achieved when combined with a role-based utility network.",0

"6D pose estimation from a single RGB image is a challenging and vital task in computer vision. The current mainstream deep model methods resort to 2D images annotated with real-world ground-truth 6D object poses, whose collection is fairly cumbersome and expensive, even unavailable in many cases. In this work, to get rid of the burden of 6D annotations, we formulate the 6D pose refinement as a Markov Decision Process and impose on the reinforcement learning approach with only 2D image annotations as weakly-supervised 6D pose information, via a delicate reward definition and a composite reinforced optimization method for efficient and effective policy training. Experiments on LINEMOD and T-LESS datasets demonstrate that our Pose-Free approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with the methods without using real-world ground-truth 6D pose labels.",0

"Thermal power generation plays a dominant role in the world's electricity supply. It consumes large amounts of coal worldwide, and causes serious air pollution. Optimizing the combustion efficiency of a thermal power generating unit (TPGU) is a highly challenging and critical task in the energy industry. We develop a new data-driven AI system, namely DeepThermal, to optimize the combustion control strategy for TPGUs. At its core, is a new model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework, called MORE, which leverages logged historical operational data of a TPGU to solve a highly complex constrained Markov decision process problem via purely offline training. MORE aims at simultaneously improving the long-term reward (increase combustion efficiency and reduce pollutant emission) and controlling operational risks (safety constraints satisfaction). In DeepThermal, we first learn a data-driven combustion process simulator from the offline dataset. The RL agent of MORE is then trained by combining real historical data as well as carefully filtered and processed simulation data through a novel restrictive exploration scheme. DeepThermal has been successfully deployed in four large coal-fired thermal power plants in China. Real-world experiments show that DeepThermal effectively improves the combustion efficiency of a TPGU. We also report and demonstrate the superior performance of MORE by comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms on the standard offline RL benchmarks. To the best knowledge of the authors, DeepThermal is the first AI application that has been used to solve real-world complex mission-critical control tasks using the offline RL approach.",0

"Constrained reinforcement learning involves multiple rewards that must individually accumulate to given thresholds. In this class of problems, we show a simple example in which the desired optimal policy cannot be induced by any linear combination of rewards. Hence, there exist constrained reinforcement learning problems for which neither regularized nor classical primal-dual methods yield optimal policies. This work addresses this shortcoming by augmenting the state with Lagrange multipliers and reinterpreting primal-dual methods as the portion of the dynamics that drives the multipliers evolution. This approach provides a systematic state augmentation procedure that is guaranteed to solve reinforcement learning problems with constraints. Thus, while primal-dual methods can fail at finding optimal policies, running the dual dynamics while executing the augmented policy yields an algorithm that provably samples actions from the optimal policy.",0

Although primal-dual methods may not always discover optimal policies, executing the augmented policy while running the dual dynamics produces an algorithm that samples actions from the optimal policy with certainty.",1
"Humans can quickly associate stimuli to solve problems in novel contexts. Our novel neural network model learns state representations of facts that can be composed to perform such associative inference. To this end, we augment the LSTM model with an associative memory, dubbed Fast Weight Memory (FWM). Through differentiable operations at every step of a given input sequence, the LSTM updates and maintains compositional associations stored in the rapidly changing FWM weights. Our model is trained end-to-end by gradient descent and yields excellent performance on compositional language reasoning problems, meta-reinforcement-learning for POMDPs, and small-scale word-level language modelling.",0

"Designing reward functions for reinforcement learning is difficult: besides specifying which behavior is rewarded for a task, the reward also has to discourage undesired outcomes. Misspecified reward functions can lead to unintended negative side effects, and overall unsafe behavior. To overcome this problem, recent work proposed to augment the specified reward function with an impact regularizer that discourages behavior that has a big impact on the environment. Although initial results with impact regularizers seem promising in mitigating some types of side effects, important challenges remain. In this paper, we examine the main current challenges of impact regularizers and relate them to fundamental design decisions. We discuss in detail which challenges recent approaches address and which remain unsolved. Finally, we explore promising directions to overcome the unsolved challenges in preventing negative side effects with impact regularizers.",0

"In Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and under the setting of Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE), agents observe and interact with their environment locally and independently. With local observation and random sampling, the randomness in rewards and observations leads to randomness in long-term returns. Existing methods such as Value Decomposition Network (VDN) and QMIX estimate the value of long-term returns as a scalar that does not contain the information of randomness. Our proposed model QR-MIX introduces quantile regression, modeling joint state-action values as a distribution, combining QMIX with Implicit Quantile Network (IQN). However, the monotonicity in QMIX limits the expression of joint state-action value distribution and may lead to incorrect estimation results in non-monotonic cases. Therefore, we proposed a flexible loss function to approximate the monotonicity found in QMIX. Our model is not only more tolerant of the randomness of returns, but also more tolerant of the randomness of monotonic constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that QR-MIX outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method QMIX in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning has been applied successfully to solve various real-world problems and the number of its applications in the multi-agent settings has been increasing. Multi-agent learning distinctly poses significant challenges in the effort to allocate a concealed communication medium. Agents receive thorough knowledge from the medium to determine subsequent actions in a distributed nature. Apparently, the goal is to leverage the cooperation of multiple agents to achieve a designated objective efficiently. Recent studies typically combine a specialized neural network with reinforcement learning to enable communication between agents. This approach, however, limits the number of agents or necessitates the homogeneity of the system. In this paper, we have proposed a more scalable approach that not only deals with a great number of agents but also enables collaboration between dissimilar functional agents and compatibly combined with any deep reinforcement learning methods. Specifically, we create a global communication map to represent the status of each agent in the system visually. The visual map and the environmental state are fed to a shared-parameter network to train multiple agents concurrently. Finally, we select the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to demonstrate our proposed scheme, namely Visual communication map for Multi-agent A3C (VMA3C).

"This paper presents the first non-asymptotic result showing that a model-free algorithm can achieve a logarithmic cumulative regret for episodic tabular reinforcement learning if there exists a strictly positive sub-optimality gap in the optimal $Q$-function.

We propose AMIGo, a novel agent incorporating -- as form of meta-learning -- a goal-generating teacher that proposes Adversarially Motivated Intrinsic Goals to train a goal-conditioned ""student"" policy in the absence of (or alongside) environment reward. Specifically, through a simple but effective ""constructively adversarial"" objective, the teacher learns to propose increasingly challenging -- yet achievable -- goals that allow the student to learn general skills for acting in a new environment, independent of the task to be solved.

"Pole-like landmark has received increasing attention as a domain-invariant visual cue for visual robot self-localization across domains (e.g., seasons, times of day, weathers). However, self-localization using pole-like landmarks can be ill-posed for a passive observer, as many viewpoints may not provide any pole-like landmark view. To alleviate this problem, we consider an active observer and explore a novel ""domain-invariant"" next-best-view (NBV) planner that attains consistent performance over different domains (i.e., maintenance-free), without requiring the expensive task of training data collection and retraining. In our approach, a novel multi-encoder deep convolutional neural network enables to detect domain invariant pole-like landmarks, which are then used as the sole input to a model-free deep reinforcement learning -based domain-invariant NBV planner. Further, we develop a practical system for active self-localization using sparse invariant landmarks and dense discriminative landmarks. In experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective both in efficient landmark detection and in discriminative self-localization.",0

"Algorithms that tackle deep exploration -- an important challenge in reinforcement learning -- have relied on epistemic uncertainty representation through ensembles or other hypermodels, exploration bonuses, or visitation count distributions. An open question is whether deep exploration can be achieved by an incremental reinforcement learning algorithm that tracks a single point estimate, without additional complexity required to account for epistemic uncertainty. We answer this question in the affirmative. In particular, we develop Langevin DQN, a variation of DQN that differs only in perturbing parameter updates with Gaussian noise and demonstrate through a computational study that the presented algorithm achieves deep exploration. We also offer some intuition to how Langevin DQN achieves deep exploration. In addition, we present a modification of the Langevin DQN algorithm to improve the computational efficiency.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has great potential in sequential decision-making. At present, the mainstream RL algorithms are data-driven, relying on millions of iterations and a large number of empirical data to learn a policy. Although data-driven RL may have excellent asymptotic performance, it usually yields slow convergence speed. As a comparison, model-driven RL employs a differentiable transition model to improve convergence speed, in which the policy gradient (PG) is calculated by using the backpropagation through time (BPTT) technique. However, such methods suffer from numerical instability, model error sensitivity and low computing efficiency, which may lead to poor policies. In this paper, a mixed policy gradient (MPG) method is proposed, which uses both empirical data and the transition model to construct the PG, so as to accelerate the convergence speed without losing the optimality guarantee. MPG contains two types of PG: 1) data-driven PG, which is obtained by directly calculating the derivative of the learned Q-value function with respect to actions, and 2) model-driven PG, which is calculated using BPTT based on the model-predictive return. We unify them by revealing the correlation between the upper bound of the unified PG error and the predictive horizon, where the data-driven PG is regraded as 0-step model-predictive return. Relying on that, MPG employs a rule-based method to adaptively adjust the weights of data-driven and model-driven PGs. In particular, to get a more accurate PG, the weight of the data-driven PG is designed to grow along the learning process while the other to decrease. Besides, an asynchronous learning framework is proposed to reduce the wall-clock time needed for each update iteration. Simulation results show that the MPG method achieves the best asymptotic performance and convergence speed compared with other baseline algorithms.",0

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) has been receiving increasingly more attention thanks to its encouraging performance on a variety of control tasks. Yet, conventional regularization techniques in training neural networks (e.g., $L_2$ regularization, dropout) have been largely ignored in RL methods, possibly because agents are typically trained and evaluated in the same environment, and because the deep RL community focuses more on high-level algorithm designs. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of regularization techniques with multiple policy optimization algorithms on continuous control tasks. Interestingly, we find conventional regularization techniques on the policy networks can often bring large improvement, especially on harder tasks. Our findings are shown to be robust against training hyperparameter variations. We also compare these techniques with the more widely used entropy regularization. In addition, we study regularizing different components and find that only regularizing the policy network is typically the best. We further analyze why regularization may help generalization in RL from four perspectives - sample complexity, reward distribution, weight norm, and noise robustness. We hope our study provides guidance for future practices in regularizing policy optimization algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/xuanlinli17/iclr2021_rlreg .",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success in estimating sequential treatment strategies which take into account patient heterogeneity. However, health-outcome information, which is used as the reward for reinforcement learning methods, is often not well coded but rather embedded in clinical notes. Extracting precise outcome information is a resource intensive task, so most of the available well-annotated cohorts are small. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that efficiently leverages a small sized labeled data with true outcome observed, and a large unlabeled data with outcome surrogates. In particular, we propose a semi-supervised, efficient approach to Q-learning and doubly robust off policy value estimation. Generalizing SSL to sequential treatment regimes brings interesting challenges: 1) Feature distribution for Q-learning is unknown as it includes previous outcomes. 2) The surrogate variables we leverage in the modified SSL framework are predictive of the outcome but not informative to the optimal policy or value function. We provide theoretical results for our Q-function and value function estimators to understand to what degree efficiency can be gained from SSL. Our method is at least as efficient as the supervised approach, and moreover safe as it robust to mis-specification of the imputation models.",0

"Modern tasks in reinforcement learning have large state and action spaces. To deal with them efficiently, one often uses predefined feature mapping to represent states and actions in a low-dimensional space.

We propose a novel algorithm that makes use of the feature mapping and obtains a $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T}/(1-\gamma)^2)$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature space, $T$ is the time horizon and $\gamma$ is the discount factor of the MDP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial regret bound without accessing the generative model or making strong assumptions such as ergodicity of the MDP. By constructing a special class of MDPs, we also show that for any algorithms, the regret is lower bounded by $\Omega(d\sqrt{T}/(1-\gamma)^{1.5})$.

"In this paper, we learn dynamics models for parametrized families of dynamical systems with varying properties. The dynamics models are formulated as stochastic processes conditioned on a latent context variable which is inferred from observed transitions of the respective system. The probabilistic formulation allows us to compute an action sequence which, for a limited number of environment interactions, optimally explores the given system within the parametrized family. This is achieved by steering the system through transitions being most informative for the context variable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for exploration on a non-linear toy-problem and two well-known reinforcement learning environments.",0
"This article explores the dynamics models of parametrized families of dynamical systems with different features. The stochastic processes of these models are reliant on latent context variables, inferred from observed transitions in the corresponding system. This probabilistic approach allows for optimal exploration of the system within the given parametric family through the calculation of an action sequence. The system is steered towards transitions that provide the most information for the context variable, all within a limited number of environmental interactions. We validate our exploration method on a non-linear toy problem and two popular reinforcement learning environments.",1
"Humans learn compositional and causal abstraction, \ie, knowledge, in response to the structure of naturalistic tasks. When presented with a problem-solving task involving some objects, toddlers would first interact with these objects to reckon what they are and what can be done with them. Leveraging these concepts, they could understand the internal structure of this task, without seeing all of the problem instances. Remarkably, they further build cognitively executable strategies to \emph{rapidly} solve novel problems. To empower a learning agent with similar capability, we argue there shall be three levels of generalization in how an agent represents its knowledge: perceptual, conceptual, and algorithmic. In this paper, we devise the very first systematic benchmark that offers joint evaluation covering all three levels. This benchmark is centered around a novel task domain, HALMA, for visual concept development and rapid problem-solving. Uniquely, HALMA has a minimum yet complete concept space, upon which we introduce a novel paradigm to rigorously diagnose and dissect learning agents' capability in understanding and generalizing complex and structural concepts. We conduct extensive experiments on reinforcement learning agents with various inductive biases and carefully report their proficiency and weakness.",0

"Offline reinforcement learning approaches can generally be divided to proximal and uncertainty-aware methods. In this work, we demonstrate the benefit of combining the two in a latent variational model. We impose a latent representation of states and actions and leverage its intrinsic Riemannian geometry to measure distance of latent samples to the data. Our proposed metrics measure both the quality of out of distribution samples as well as the discrepancy of examples in the data. We integrate our metrics in a model-based offline optimization framework, in which proximity and uncertainty can be carefully controlled. We illustrate the geodesics on a simple grid-like environment, depicting its natural inherent topology. Finally, we analyze our approach and improve upon contemporary offline RL benchmarks.",0

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods rely on experience replay to approximate the minibatched supervised learning setting; however, unlike supervised learning where access to lots of training data is crucial to generalization, replay-based deep RL appears to struggle in the presence of extraneous data. Recent works have shown that the performance of Deep Q-Network (DQN) degrades when its replay memory becomes too large.   This suggests that outdated experiences somehow impact the performance of deep RL, which should not be the case for off-policy methods like DQN. Consequently, we re-examine the motivation for sampling uniformly over a replay memory, and find that it may be flawed when using function approximation. We show that -- despite conventional wisdom -- sampling from the uniform distribution does not yield uncorrelated training samples and therefore biases gradients during training. Our theory prescribes a special non-uniform distribution to cancel this effect, and we propose a stratified sampling scheme to efficiently implement it.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most active fields of AI research. Despite the interest demonstrated by the research community in reinforcement learning, the development methodology still lags behind, with a severe lack of standard APIs to foster the development of RL applications. OpenAI Gym is probably the most used environment to develop RL applications and simulations, but most of the abstractions proposed in such a framework are still assuming a semi-structured methodology. This is particularly relevant for agent-based models whose purpose is to analyse adaptive behaviour displayed by self-learning agents in the simulation. In order to bridge this gap, we present a workflow and tools for the decoupled development and maintenance of multi-purpose agent-based models and derived single-purpose reinforcement learning environments, enabling the researcher to swap out environments with ones representing different perspectives or different reward models, all while keeping the underlying domain model intact and separate. The Sim-Env Python library generates OpenAI-Gym-compatible reinforcement learning environments that use existing or purposely created domain models as their simulation back-ends. Its design emphasizes ease-of-use, modularity and code separation.",0

"Recently, various auxiliary tasks have been proposed to accelerate representation learning and improve sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing auxiliary tasks do not take the characteristics of RL problems into consideration and are unsupervised. By leveraging returns, the most important feedback signals in RL, we propose a novel auxiliary task that forces the learnt representations to discriminate state-action pairs with different returns. Our auxiliary loss is theoretically justified to learn representations that capture the structure of a new form of state-action abstraction, under which state-action pairs with similar return distributions are aggregated together. In low data regime, our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on complex tasks in Atari games and DeepMind Control suite, and achieves even better performance when combined with existing auxiliary tasks.",0

"Reinforcement learning agents have been mostly developed and evaluated under the assumption that they will operate in a fully autonomous manner -- they will take all actions. In this work, our goal is to develop algorithms that, by learning to switch control between machine and human agents, allow existing reinforcement learning agents to operate under different automation levels. To this end, we first formally define the problem of learning to switch control among agents in a team via a 2-layer Markov decision process. Then, we develop an online learning algorithm that uses upper confidence bounds on the agents' policies and the environment's transition probabilities to find a sequence of switching policies. We prove that the total regret of our algorithm with respect to the optimal switching policy is sublinear in the number of learning steps. Moreover, we also show that our algorithm can be used to find multiple sequences of switching policies across several independent teams of agents operating in similar environments, where it greatly benefits from maintaining shared confidence bounds for the environments' transition probabilities. Simulation experiments in obstacle avoidance in a semi-autonomous driving scenario illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that, by exploiting the specific structure of the problem, our proposed algorithm is superior to problem-agnostic algorithms.",0

"Agents trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms are capable of performing highly complex tasks including locomotion in continuous environments. We investigate transferring the learning acquired in one task to a set of previously unseen tasks. Generalization and overfitting in deep reinforcement learning are not commonly addressed in current transfer learning research. Conducting a comparative analysis without an intermediate regularization step results in underperforming benchmarks and inaccurate algorithm comparisons due to rudimentary assessments. In this study, we propose regularization techniques in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control through the application of sample elimination, early stopping and maximum entropy regularized adversarial learning. First, the importance of the inclusion of training iteration number to the hyperparameters in deep transfer reinforcement learning will be discussed. Because source task performance is not indicative of the generalization capacity of the algorithm, we start by acknowledging the training iteration number as a hyperparameter. In line with this, we introduce an additional step of resorting to earlier snapshots of policy parameters to prevent overfitting to the source task. Then, to generate robust policies, we discard the samples that lead to overfitting via a method we call strict clipping. Furthermore, we increase the generalization capacity in widely used transfer learning benchmarks by using maximum entropy regularization, different critic methods, and curriculum learning in an adversarial setup. Subsequently, we propose maximum entropy adversarial reinforcement learning to increase the domain randomization. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of these methods on simulated robots in target environments where the morphology of the robot, gravity, and tangential friction coefficient of the environment are altered.",0

"We consider the problem where $M$ agents interact with $M$ identical and independent environments with $S$ states and $A$ actions using reinforcement learning for $T$ rounds.

"Non-stationarity is one thorny issue in multi-agent reinforcement learning, which is caused by the policy changes of agents during the learning procedure. Current works to solve this problem have their own limitations in effectiveness and scalability, such as centralized critic and decentralized actor (CCDA), population-based self-play, modeling of others and etc. In this paper, we novelly introduce a $\delta$-stationarity measurement to explicitly model the stationarity of a policy sequence, which is theoretically proved to be proportional to the joint policy divergence. However, simple policy factorization like mean-field approximation will mislead to larger policy divergence, which can be considered as trust region decomposition dilemma. We model the joint policy as a general Markov random field and propose a trust region decomposition network based on message passing to estimate the joint policy divergence more accurately. The Multi-Agent Mirror descent policy algorithm with Trust region decomposition, called MAMT, is established with the purpose to satisfy $\delta$-stationarity. MAMT can adjust the trust region of the local policies adaptively in an end-to-end manner, thereby approximately constraining the divergence of joint policy to alleviate the non-stationary problem. Our method can bring noticeable and stable performance improvement compared with baselines in coordination tasks of different complexity.",0

"Advances in computing resources have resulted in the increasing complexity of cyber-physical systems (CPS). As the complexity of CPS evolved, the focus has shifted from traditional control methods to deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) methods for control of these systems. This is due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate models of complex CPS for traditional control. However, to securely deploy DRL in production, it is essential to examine the weaknesses of DRL-based controllers (policies) towards malicious attacks from all angles. In this work, we investigate targeted attacks in the action-space domain, also commonly known as actuation attacks in CPS literature, which perturbs the outputs of a controller. We show that a query-based black-box attack model that generates optimal perturbations with respect to an adversarial goal can be formulated as another reinforcement learning problem. Thus, such an adversarial policy can be trained using conventional DRL methods. Experimental results showed that adversarial policies that only observe the nominal policy's output generate stronger attacks than adversarial policies that observe the nominal policy's input and output. Further analysis reveals that nominal policies whose outputs are frequently at the boundaries of the action space are naturally more robust towards adversarial policies. Lastly, we propose the use of adversarial training with transfer learning to induce robust behaviors into the nominal policy, which decreases the rate of successful targeted attacks by 50%.",0

"Most compilers for machine learning (ML) frameworks need to solve many correlated optimization problems to generate efficient machine code. Current ML compilers rely on heuristics based algorithms to solve these optimization problems one at a time. However, this approach is not only hard to maintain but often leads to sub-optimal solutions especially for newer model architectures. Existing learning based approaches in the literature are sample inefficient, tackle a single optimization problem, and do not generalize to unseen graphs making them infeasible to be deployed in practice. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end, transferable deep reinforcement learning method for computational graph optimization (GO), based on a scalable sequential attention mechanism over an inductive graph neural network. GO generates decisions on the entire graph rather than on each individual node autoregressively, drastically speeding up the search compared to prior methods. Moreover, we propose recurrent attention layers to jointly optimize dependent graph optimization tasks and demonstrate 33%-60% speedup on three graph optimization tasks compared to TensorFlow default optimization. On a diverse set of representative graphs consisting of up to 80,000 nodes, including Inception-v3, Transformer-XL, and WaveNet, GO achieves on average 21% improvement over human experts and 18% improvement over the prior state of the art with 15x faster convergence, on a device placement task evaluated in real systems.",0

"Bandit and reinforcement learning (RL) problems can often be framed as optimization problems where the goal is to maximize average performance while having access only to stochastic estimates of the true gradient. Traditionally, stochastic optimization theory predicts that learning dynamics are governed by the curvature of the loss function and the noise of the gradient estimates. In this paper we demonstrate that this is not the case for bandit and RL problems. To allow our analysis to be interpreted in light of multi-step MDPs, we focus on techniques derived from stochastic optimization principles (e.g., natural policy gradient and EXP3) and we show that some standard assumptions from optimization theory are violated in these problems. We present theoretical results showing that, at least for bandit problems, curvature and noise are not sufficient to explain the learning dynamics and that seemingly innocuous choices like the baseline can determine whether an algorithm converges. These theoretical findings match our empirical evaluation, which we extend to multi-state MDPs.",0

"We show how to construct variance-aware confidence sets for linear bandits and linear mixture Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our method yields the following new regret bounds:   * For linear bandits, we obtain an $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d)\sqrt{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{K}\sigma_i^2})$ regret bound, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $K$ is the number of rounds, and $\sigma_i^2$ is the (unknown) variance of the reward at the $i$-th round. This is the first regret bound that only scales with the variance and the dimension, with no explicit polynomial dependency on $K$.   * For linear mixture MDP, we obtain an $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d, \log H)\sqrt{K})$ regret bound, where $d$ is the number of base models, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $H$ is the planning horizon. This is the first regret bound that only scales logarithmically with $H$ in the reinforcement learning with linear function approximation setting, thus exponentially improving existing results.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation has received increasing attention recently. However, existing work has focused on obtaining $\sqrt{T}$-type regret bound, where $T$ is the number of interactions with the MDP. In this paper, we show that logarithmic regret is attainable under two recently proposed linear MDP assumptions provided that there exists a positive sub-optimality gap for the optimal action-value function. More specifically, under the linear MDP assumption (Jin et al. 2019), the LSVI-UCB algorithm can achieve $\tilde{O}(d^{3}H^5/\text{gap}_{\text{min}}\cdot \log(T))$ regret; and under the linear mixture MDP assumption (Ayoub et al. 2020), the UCRL-VTR algorithm can achieve $\tilde{O}(d^{2}H^5/\text{gap}_{\text{min}}\cdot \log^3(T))$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of feature mapping, $H$ is the length of episode, $\text{gap}_{\text{min}}$ is the minimal sub-optimality gap, and $\tilde O$ hides all logarithmic terms except $\log(T)$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first logarithmic regret bounds for RL with linear function approximation. We also establish gap-dependent lower bounds for the two linear MDP models.",0

Specifically, the linear MDP assumption (Jin et al. 2019) can achieve $\tilde{O}(d^{3}H^5/\text{gap}_{\text{min}}\cdot \log(T))$ regret with the LSVI-UCB algorithm, while the linear mixture MDP assumption (Ayoub et al. 2020) can obtain $\tilde{O}(d^{2}H^5/\text{gap}_{\text{min}}\cdot \log^3(T))$ regret with the UCRL-VTR algorithm. Here, $d$ represents the dimension of feature mapping, $H$ is the length of episode, $\text{gap}_{\text{min}}$ is the minimal sub-optimality gap, and $\tilde O$ hides all logarithmic terms except $\log(T)$. These are the first logarithmic regret bounds for RL with linear function approximation. Additionally, gap-dependent lower bounds for the two linear MDP models are also established.",1
"We study the reinforcement learning problem for discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under the tabular setting. We propose a model-based algorithm named UCBVI-$\gamma$, which is based on the \emph{optimism in the face of uncertainty principle} and the Bernstein-type bonus. We show that UCBVI-$\gamma$ achieves an $\tilde{O}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$ regret, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $T$ is the number of steps. In addition, we construct a class of hard MDPs and show that for any algorithm, the expected regret is at least $\tilde{\Omega}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$. Our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors, which suggests that UCBVI-$\gamma$ is nearly minimax optimal for discounted MDPs.",0

"Latest insights from biology show that intelligence does not only emerge from the connections between the neurons, but that individual neurons shoulder more computational responsibility. Current Neural Network architecture design and search are biased on fixed activation functions. Using more advanced learnable activation functions provide Neural Networks with higher learning capacity. However, general guidance for building such networks is still missing. In this work, we first explain why rationals offer an optimal choice for activation functions. We then show that they are closed under residual connections, and inspired by recurrence for residual networks we derive a self-regularized version of Rationals: Recurrent Rationals. We demonstrate that (Recurrent) Rational Networks lead to high performance improvements on Image Classification and Deep Reinforcement Learning.",0

"One of the main challenges in real-world reinforcement learning is to learn successfully from limited training samples. We show that in certain settings, the available data can be dramatically increased through a form of multi-task learning, by exploiting an invariance property in the tasks. We provide a theoretical performance bound for the gain in sample efficiency under this setting. This motivates a new approach to multi-task learning, which involves the design of an appropriate neural network architecture and a prioritized task-sampling strategy. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two real-world sequential resource allocation tasks where this invariance property occurs: financial portfolio optimization and meta federated learning.",0

"We approach the task of network congestion control in datacenters using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Successful congestion control algorithms can dramatically improve latency and overall network throughput. Until today, no such learning-based algorithms have shown practical potential in this domain. Evidently, the most popular recent deployments rely on rule-based heuristics that are tested on a predetermined set of benchmarks. Consequently, these heuristics do not generalize well to newly-seen scenarios. Contrarily, we devise an RL-based algorithm with the aim of generalizing to different configurations of real-world datacenter networks. We overcome challenges such as partial-observability, non-stationarity, and multi-objectiveness. We further propose a policy gradient algorithm that leverages the analytical structure of the reward function to approximate its derivative and improve stability. We show that this scheme outperforms alternative popular RL approaches, and generalizes to scenarios that were not seen during training. Our experiments, conducted on a realistic simulator that emulates communication networks' behavior, exhibit improved performance concurrently on the multiple considered metrics compared to the popular algorithms deployed today in real datacenters. Our algorithm is being productized to replace heuristics in some of the largest datacenters in the world.",0

"We consider the decision-making framework of online convex optimization with a very large number of experts. This setting is ubiquitous in contextual and reinforcement learning problems, where the size of the policy class renders enumeration and search within the policy class infeasible.   Instead, we consider generalizing the methodology of online boosting. We define a weak learning algorithm as a mechanism that guarantees multiplicatively approximate regret against a base class of experts. In this access model, we give an efficient boosting algorithm that guarantees near-optimal regret against the convex hull of the base class.

"Campbell-Goodhart's law relates to the causal inference error whereby decision-making agents aim to influence variables which are correlated to their goal objective but do not reliably cause it. This is a well known error in Economics and Political Science but not widely labelled in Artificial Intelligence research. Through a simple example, we show how off-the-shelf deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are not necessarily immune to this cognitive error. The off-policy learning method is tricked, whilst the on-policy method is not. The practical implication is that naive application of RL to complex real life problems can result in the same types of policy errors that humans make. Great care should be taken around understanding the causal model that underpins a solution derived from Reinforcement Learning.",0

This is a commonly recognized error in Political Science and Economics, though it is not frequently referred to in Artificial Intelligence research. To illustrate, we demonstrate how readily available deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can fall prey to this cognitive fallacy using a straightforward example. The off-policy learning technique is deceived, whereas the on-policy technique is not. The practical outcome is that applying RL to intricate real-world issues without caution can lead to the same types of policy errors that humans commit. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the causal model supporting a solution derived from Reinforcement Learning.",1
"This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to represent strategic bidding behavior in freight transport markets. Using this algorithm, we investigate whether feasible market equilibriums arise without any central control or communication between agents. Studying behavior in such environments may serve as a stepping stone towards self-organizing logistics systems like the Physical Internet. We model an agent-based environment in which a shipper and a carrier actively learn bidding strategies using policy gradient methods, posing bid- and ask prices at the individual container level. Both agents aim to learn the best response given the expected behavior of the opposing agent. A neutral broker allocates jobs based on bid-ask spreads.   Our game-theoretical analysis and numerical experiments focus on behavioral insights. To evaluate system performance, we measure adherence to Nash equilibria, fairness of reward division and utilization of transport capacity. We observe good performance both in predictable, deterministic settings (~95% adherence to Nash equilibria) and highly stochastic environments (~85% adherence). Risk-seeking behavior may increase an agent's reward share, as long as the strategies are not overly aggressive. The results suggest a potential for full automation and decentralization of freight transport markets.",0

"Efficient exploration has presented a long-standing challenge in reinforcement learning, especially when rewards are sparse. A developmental system can overcome this difficulty by learning from both demonstrations and self-exploration. However, existing methods are not applicable to most real-world robotic controlling problems because they assume that environments follow Markov decision processes (MDP); thus, they do not extend to partially observable environments where historical observations are necessary for decision making. This paper builds on the idea of replaying demonstrations for memory-dependent continuous control, by proposing a novel algorithm, Recurrent Actor-Critic with Demonstration and Experience Replay (READER). Experiments involving several memory-crucial continuous control tasks reveal significantly reduce interactions with the environment using our method with a reasonably small number of demonstration samples. The algorithm also shows better sample efficiency and learning capabilities than a baseline reinforcement learning algorithm for memory-based control from demonstrations.",0

"Due to its perceptual limitations, an agent may have too little information about the state of the environment to act optimally. In such cases, it is important to keep track of the observation history to uncover hidden state. Recent deep reinforcement learning methods use recurrent neural networks (RNN) to memorize past observations. However, these models are expensive to train and have convergence difficulties, especially when dealing with high dimensional input spaces. In this paper, we propose influence-aware memory (IAM), a theoretically inspired memory architecture that tries to alleviate the training difficulties by restricting the input of the recurrent layers to those variables that influence the hidden state information. Moreover, as opposed to standard RNNs, in which every piece of information used for estimating Q values is inevitably fed back into the network for the next prediction, our model allows information to flow without being necessarily stored in the RNN's internal memory. Results indicate that, by letting the recurrent layers focus on a small fraction of the observation variables while processing the rest of the information with a feedforward neural network, we can outperform standard recurrent architectures both in training speed and policy performance. This approach also reduces runtime and obtains better scores than methods that stack multiple observations to remove partial observability.",0

"Finding an effective medical treatment often requires a search by trial and error. Making this search more efficient by minimizing the number of unnecessary trials could lower both costs and patient suffering. We formalize this problem as learning a policy for finding a near-optimal treatment in a minimum number of trials using a causal inference framework. We give a model-based dynamic programming algorithm which learns from observational data while being robust to unmeasured confounding. To reduce time complexity, we suggest a greedy algorithm which bounds the near-optimality constraint.

"Data augmentation technique from computer vision has been widely considered as a regularization method to improve data efficiency and generalization performance in vision-based reinforcement learning. We variate the timing of using augmentation, which is, in turn, critical depending on tasks to be solved in training and testing. According to our experiments on Open AI Procgen Benchmark, if the regularization imposed by augmentation is helpful only in testing, it is better to procrastinate the augmentation after training than to use it during training in terms of sample and computation complexity. We note that some of such augmentations can disturb the training process. Conversely, an augmentation providing regularization useful in training needs to be used during the whole training period to fully utilize its benefit in terms of not only generalization but also data efficiency. These phenomena suggest a useful timing control of data augmentation in reinforcement learning.",0

It should be noted that certain augmentations can hinder the training process. Conversely, if an augmentation is beneficial for training regularization, it should be applied throughout the entire training period to maximize its benefits for generalization and data efficiency.

"Safety is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in real-world tasks like autonomous driving. Chance constraints which guarantee the satisfaction of state constraints at a high probability are suitable to represent the requirements in real-world environment with uncertainty. Existing chance constrained RL methods like the penalty method and the Lagrangian method either exhibit periodic oscillations or cannot satisfy the constraints. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing a separated proportional-integral Lagrangian (SPIL) algorithm. Taking a control perspective, we first interpret the penalty method and the Lagrangian method as proportional feedback and integral feedback control, respectively. Then, a proportional-integral Lagrangian method is proposed to steady learning process while improving safety. To prevent integral overshooting and reduce conservatism, we introduce the integral separation technique inspired by PID control. Finally, an analytical gradient of the chance constraint is utilized for model-based policy optimization. The effectiveness of SPIL is demonstrated by a narrow car-following task. Experiments indicate that compared with previous methods, SPIL improves the performance while guaranteeing safety, with a steady learning process.",0

"Epistemic uncertainty is the part of out-of-sample prediction error due to the lack of knowledge of the learner. Whereas previous work was focusing on model variance, we propose a principled approach for directly estimating epistemic uncertainty by learning to predict generalization error and subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty, i.e., intrinsic unpredictability. This estimator of epistemic uncertainty includes the effect of model bias and can be applied in non-stationary learning environments arising in active learning or reinforcement learning. In addition to demonstrating these properties of Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP), we illustrate its advantage against existing methods for uncertainty estimation on downstream tasks including sequential model optimization and reinforcement learning. We also evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates from DEUP for probabilistic classification of images and for estimating uncertainty about synergistic drug combinations.",0

"Model-based algorithms, which learn a dynamics model from logged experience and perform some sort of pessimistic planning under the learned model, have emerged as a promising paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (offline RL). However, practical variants of such model-based algorithms rely on explicit uncertainty quantification for incorporating pessimism. Uncertainty estimation with complex models, such as deep neural networks, can be difficult and unreliable. We overcome this limitation by developing a new model-based offline RL algorithm, COMBO, that regularizes the value function on out-of-support state-action tuples generated via rollouts under the learned model. This results in a conservative estimate of the value function for out-of-support state-action tuples, without requiring explicit uncertainty estimation. We theoretically show that our method optimizes a lower bound on the true policy value, that this bound is tighter than that of prior methods, and our approach satisfies a policy improvement guarantee in the offline setting. Through experiments, we find that COMBO consistently performs as well or better as compared to prior offline model-free and model-based methods on widely studied offline RL benchmarks, including image-based tasks.",0

"Deep RL approaches build much of their success on the ability of the deep neural network to generate useful internal representations. Nevertheless, they suffer from a high sample-complexity and starting with a good input representation can have a significant impact on the performance. In this paper, we exploit the fact that the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) represents a graph, which enables us to incorporate the topological information for effective state representation learning.   Motivated by the recent success of node representations for several graph analytical tasks we specifically investigate the capability of node representation learning methods to effectively encode the topology of the underlying MDP in Deep RL. To this end we perform a comparative analysis of several models chosen from 4 different classes of representation learning algorithms for policy learning in grid-world navigation tasks, which are representative of a large class of RL problems.

"Monte-Carlo planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are essential to sequential decision making. The recent AlphaGo and AlphaZero algorithms have shown how to successfully combine these two paradigms in order to solve large scale sequential decision problems. These methodologies exploit a variant of the well-known UCT algorithm to trade off exploitation of good actions and exploration of unvisited states, but their empirical success comes at the cost of poor sample-efficiency and high computation time. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by considering convex regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which has been successfully used in RL to efficiently drive exploration. First, we introduce a unifying theory on the use of generic convex regularizers in MCTS, deriving the regret analysis and providing guarantees of exponential convergence rate. Second, we exploit our theoretical framework to introduce novel regularized backup operators for MCTS, based on the relative entropy of the policy update, and on the Tsallis entropy of the policy.

"Sequential decision making requires the use of Monte-Carlo planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The AlphaGo and AlphaZero algorithms have demonstrated the success of combining these two paradigms to solve large scale decision problems. However, the UCT algorithm used in these methodologies sacrifices sample-efficiency and computation time for empirical success. To overcome these limitations, we propose the use of convex regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which has been proven effective in RL for exploration. Our paper presents a theory on the use of generic convex regularizers in MCTS, establishing the regret analysis and exponential convergence rate guarantees.

"Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in developing high-level autonomous driving. However, for high-dimensional tasks, current RL methods suffer from low data efficiency and oscillation in the training process. This paper proposes an algorithm called Learn to drive with Virtual Memory (LVM) to overcome these problems. LVM compresses the high-dimensional information into compact latent states and learns a latent dynamic model to summarize the agent's experience. Various imagined latent trajectories are generated as virtual memory by the latent dynamic model. The policy is learned by propagating gradient through the learned latent model with the imagined latent trajectories and thus leads to high data efficiency. Furthermore, a double critic structure is designed to reduce the oscillation during the training process. The effectiveness of LVM is demonstrated by an image-input autonomous driving task, in which LVM outperforms the existing method in terms of data efficiency, learning stability, and control performance.",0

"Generative design refers to computational design methods that can automatically conduct design exploration under constraints defined by designers. Among many approaches, topology optimization-based generative designs aim to explore diverse topology designs, which cannot be represented by conventional parametric design approaches. Recently, data-driven topology optimization research has started to exploit artificial intelligence, such as deep learning or machine learning, to improve the capability of design exploration. This study proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based generative design process, with reward functions maximizing the diversity of topology designs. We formulate generative design as a sequential problem of finding optimal design parameter combinations in accordance with a given reference design. Proximal Policy Optimization is used as the learning framework, which is demonstrated in the case study of an automotive wheel design problem. To reduce the heavy computational burden of the wheel topology optimization process required by our RL formulation, we approximate the optimization process with neural networks. With efficient data preprocessing/augmentation and neural architecture, the neural networks achieve a generalized performance and symmetricity-reserving characteristics. We show that RL-based generative design produces a large number of diverse designs within a short inference time by exploiting GPU in a fully automated manner.

"Humans quickly solve tasks in novel systems with complex dynamics, without requiring much interaction. While deep reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved tremendous success in many complex tasks, these algorithms need a large number of samples to learn meaningful policies. In this paper, we present a task for navigating a marble to the center of a circular maze. While this system is very intuitive and easy for humans to solve, it can be very difficult and inefficient for standard reinforcement learning algorithms to learn meaningful policies. We present a model that learns to move a marble in the complex environment within minutes of interacting with the real system. Learning consists of initializing a physics engine with parameters estimated using data from the real system. The error in the physics engine is then corrected using Gaussian process regression, which is used to model the residual between real observations and physics engine simulations. The physics engine augmented with the residual model is then used to control the marble in the maze environment using a model-predictive feedback over a receding horizon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a hybrid model consisting of a full physics engine along with a statistical function approximator has been used to control a complex physical system in real-time using nonlinear model-predictive control (NMPC).",0

"The success of deep learning in the computer vision and natural language processing communities can be attributed to training of very deep neural networks with millions or billions of parameters which can then be trained with massive amounts of data. However, similar trend has largely eluded training of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where larger networks do not lead to performance improvement. Previous work has shown that this is mostly due to instability during training of deep RL agents when using larger networks. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand and address training of larger networks for deep RL. We first show that naively increasing network capacity does not improve performance. Then, we propose a novel method that consists of 1) wider networks with DenseNet connection, 2) decoupling representation learning from training of RL, 3) a distributed training method to mitigate overfitting problems. Using this three-fold technique, we show that we can train very large networks that result in significant performance gains. We present several ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and some intuitive understanding of the reasons for performance gain.

"Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is considered to be a promising approach to reduce the sample complexity that hinders model-free RL. However, the theoretical understanding of such methods has been rather limited. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework for designing and analyzing model-based RL algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We design a meta-algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of monotone improvement to a local maximum of the expected reward. The meta-algorithm iteratively builds a lower bound of the expected reward based on the estimated dynamical model and sample trajectories, and then maximizes the lower bound jointly over the policy and the model. The framework extends the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty principle to non-linear dynamical models in a way that requires \textit{no explicit} uncertainty quantification. Instantiating our framework with simplification gives a variant of model-based RL algorithms Stochastic Lower Bounds Optimization (SLBO).

"We introduce causal Markov Decision Processes (C-MDPs), a new formalism for sequential decision making which combines the standard MDP formulation with causal structures over state transition and reward functions. Many contemporary and emerging application areas such as digital healthcare and digital marketing can benefit from modeling with C-MDPs due to the causal mechanisms underlying the relationship between interventions and states/rewards. We propose the causal upper confidence bound value iteration (C-UCBVI) algorithm that exploits the causal structure in C-MDPs and improves the performance of standard reinforcement learning algorithms that do not take causal knowledge into account. We prove that C-UCBVI satisfies an $\tilde{O}(HS\sqrt{ZT})$ regret bound, where $T$ is the the total time steps, $H$ is the episodic horizon, and $S$ is the cardinality of the state space. Notably, our regret bound does not scale with the size of actions/interventions ($A$), but only scales with a causal graph dependent quantity $Z$ which can be exponentially smaller than $A$. By extending C-UCBVI to the factored MDP setting, we propose the causal factored UCBVI (CF-UCBVI) algorithm, which further reduces the regret exponentially in terms of $S$. Furthermore, we show that RL algorithms for linear MDP problems can also be incorporated in C-MDPs.

"In this paper, we consider a type of image quality assessment as a task-specific measurement, which can be used to select images that are more amenable to a given target task, such as image classification or segmentation. We propose to train simultaneously two neural networks for image selection and a target task using reinforcement learning. A controller network learns an image selection policy by maximising an accumulated reward based on the target task performance on the controller-selected validation set, whilst the target task predictor is optimised using the training set. The trained controller is therefore able to reject those images that lead to poor accuracy in the target task. In this work, we show that the controller-predicted image quality can be significantly different from the task-specific image quality labels that are manually defined by humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn effective image quality assessment without using a ``clean'' validation set, thereby avoiding the requirement for human labelling of images with respect to their amenability for the task. Using $6712$, labelled and segmented, clinical ultrasound images from $259$ patients, experimental results on holdout data show that the proposed image quality assessment achieved a mean classification accuracy of $0.94\pm0.01$ and a mean segmentation Dice of $0.89\pm0.02$, by discarding $5\%$ and $15\%$ of the acquired images, respectively. The significantly improved performance was observed for both tested tasks, compared with the respective $0.90\pm0.01$ and $0.82\pm0.02$ from networks without considering task amenability. This enables image quality feedback during real-time ultrasound acquisition among many other medical imaging applications.",0

"Electric Vehicle (EV) has become a preferable choice in the modern transportation system due to its environmental and energy sustainability. However, in many large cities, EV drivers often fail to find the proper spots for charging, because of the limited charging infrastructures and the spatiotemporally unbalanced charging demands. Indeed, the recent emergence of deep reinforcement learning provides great potential to improve the charging experience from various aspects over a long-term horizon. In this paper, we propose a framework, named Multi-Agent Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (Master), for intelligently recommending public accessible charging stations by jointly considering various long-term spatiotemporal factors. Specifically, by regarding each charging station as an individual agent, we formulate this problem as a multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning task. We first develop a multi-agent actor-critic framework with the centralized attentive critic to coordinate the recommendation between geo-distributed agents. Moreover, to quantify the influence of future potential charging competition, we introduce a delayed access strategy to exploit the knowledge of future charging competition during training. After that, to effectively optimize multiple learning objectives, we extend the centralized attentive critic to multi-critics and develop a dynamic gradient re-weighting strategy to adaptively guide the optimization direction. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Master achieves the best comprehensive performance compared with nine baseline approaches.",0

"Reinforcement learning with sparse rewards is challenging because an agent can rarely obtain non-zero rewards and hence, gradient-based optimization of parameterized policies can be incremental and slow. Recent work demonstrated that using a memory buffer of previous successful trajectories can result in more effective policies. However, existing methods may overly exploit past successful experiences, which can encourage the agent to adopt sub-optimal and myopic behaviors. In this work, instead of focusing on good experiences with limited diversity, we propose to learn a trajectory-conditioned policy to follow and expand diverse past trajectories from a memory buffer. Our method allows the agent to reach diverse regions in the state space and improve upon the past trajectories to reach new states. We empirically show that our approach significantly outperforms count-based exploration methods (parametric approach) and self-imitation learning (parametric approach with non-parametric memory) on various complex tasks with local optima. In particular, without using expert demonstrations or resetting to arbitrary states, we achieve the state-of-the-art scores under five billion number of frames, on challenging Atari games such as Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall.",0

"Training deep reinforcement learning agents on environments with multiple levels / scenes from the same task, has become essential for many applications aiming to achieve generalization and domain transfer from simulation to the real world. While such a strategy is helpful with generalization, the use of multiple scenes significantly increases the variance of samples collected for policy gradient computations. Current methods, effectively continue to view this collection of scenes as a single Markov decision process (MDP), and thus learn a scene-generic value function V(s). However, we argue that the sample variance for a multi-scene environment is best minimized by treating each scene as a distinct MDP, and then learning a joint value function V(s,M) dependent on both state s and MDP M. We further demonstrate that the true joint value function for a multi-scene environment, follows a multi-modal distribution which is not captured by traditional CNN / LSTM based critic networks. To this end, we propose a dynamic value estimation (DVE) technique, which approximates the true joint value function through a sparse attention mechanism over multiple value function hypothesis / modes.

"The issue of generalization in reinforcement learning is explored, taking into account the potential variations in visual observations, such as changes in background, contrast, and brightness. Throughout the training process, our agent is limited to just a few of the MDPs from the distribution, with performance evaluated on previously unseen test domains. To address this ""zero-shot RL"" challenge, we utilize a domain adversarial optimization procedure to ensure that the learned representations remain invariant across visual domains. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances generalization to new, unfamiliar domains.",1
"Due to recent empirical successes, the options framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning is gaining increasing popularity. Rather than learning from rewards which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we consider learning an options-type hierarchical policy from expert demonstrations. Such a problem is referred to as hierarchical imitation learning. Converting this problem to parameter inference in a latent variable model, we theoretically characterize the EM approach proposed by Daniel et al. (2016). The population level algorithm is analyzed as an intermediate step, which is nontrivial due to the samples being correlated. If the expert policy can be parameterized by a variant of the options framework, then under regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges with high probability to a norm ball around the true parameter. To our knowledge, this is the first performance guarantee for an hierarchical imitation learning algorithm that only observes primitive state-action pairs.",0

"The low rank MDP has emerged as an important model for studying representation learning and exploration in reinforcement learning. With a known representation, several model-free exploration strategies exist. In contrast, all algorithms for the unknown representation setting are model-based, thereby requiring the ability to model the full dynamics. In this work, we present the first model-free representation learning algorithms for low rank MDPs. The key algorithmic contribution is a new minimax representation learning objective, for which we provide variants with differing tradeoffs in their statistical and computational properties. We interleave this representation learning step with an exploration strategy to cover the state space in a reward-free manner. The resulting algorithms are provably sample efficient and can accommodate general function approximation to scale to complex environments.",0

"Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver's reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.",0
"The prevalence of mobile computing has allowed ride-hailing services to accumulate substantial amounts of data on the behavior of both drivers and passengers, which they can then use to optimize the allocation of supply and demand in real-time. Despite their ability to assign vehicles to requests, these service providers must contend with the uncertainty that arises from the self-interest of drivers who are free to drive when not on a job. To address this issue, we have developed an algorithm that formulates the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and derives an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework employs value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy and policy propagation to calculate the multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Additionally, we have created a method for learning a driver's reward function that can be applied to environments with vastly different dynamics from the original training data. Our approach was evaluated using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset, and was found to outperform several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy, even when faced with changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and a decrease in data quality.

"Temporal abstractions in the form of options have been shown to help reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn faster. However, despite prior work on this topic, the problem of discovering options through interaction with an environment remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel meta-gradient approach for discovering useful options in multi-task RL environments. Our approach is based on a manager-worker decomposition of the RL agent, in which a manager maximises rewards from the environment by learning a task-dependent policy over both a set of task-independent discovered-options and primitive actions. The option-reward and termination functions that define a subgoal for each option are parameterised as neural networks and trained via meta-gradients to maximise their usefulness. Empirical analysis on gridworld and DeepMind Lab tasks show that: (1) our approach can discover meaningful and diverse temporally-extended options in multi-task RL domains, (2) the discovered options are frequently used by the agent while learning to solve the training tasks, and (3) that the discovered options help a randomly initialised manager learn faster in completely new tasks.",0

"The principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty is one of the most widely used and successful ideas in multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning. However, existing optimistic algorithms (primarily UCB and its variants) are often unable to deal with large context spaces. Essentially all existing well performing algorithms for general contextual bandit problems rely on weighted action allocation schemes; and theoretical guarantees for optimism-based algorithms are only known for restricted formulations. In this paper we study general contextual bandits under the realizability condition, and propose a simple generic principle to design optimistic algorithms, dubbed ""Upper Counterfactual Confidence Bounds"" (UCCB). We show that these algorithms are provably optimal and efficient in the presence of large context spaces. Key components of UCCB include: 1) a systematic analysis of confidence bounds in policy space rather than in action space; and 2) the potential function perspective that is used to express the power of optimism in the contextual setting. We further show how the UCCB principle can be extended to infinite action spaces, by constructing confidence bounds via the newly introduced notion of ""counterfactual action divergence.""",0

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have led to recent successes in solving complex games, such as Atari or Starcraft, and to a huge impact in real-world applications, such as cybersecurity or autonomous driving. In the side of the drawbacks, recent works have shown how the performance of RL algorithms decreases under the influence of soft changes in the reward function. However, little work has been done about how sensitive these disturbances are depending on the aggressiveness of the attack and the learning exploration strategy. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap in the literature analyzing the effects of different attack strategies based on reward perturbations, and studying the effect in the learner depending on its exploration strategy. In order to explain all the behaviors, we choose a sub-class of MDPs: episodic, stochastic goal-only-rewards MDPs, and in particular, an intelligible grid domain as a benchmark. In this domain, we demonstrate that smoothly crafting adversarial rewards are able to mislead the learner, and that using low exploration probability values, the policy learned is more robust to corrupt rewards. Finally, in the proposed learning scenario, a counterintuitive result arises: attacking at each learning episode is the lowest cost attack strategy.",0

"A central capability of a long-lived reinforcement learning (RL) agent is to incrementally adapt its behavior as its environment changes, and to incrementally build upon previous experiences to facilitate future learning in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose LifeLong Incremental Reinforcement Learning (LLIRL), a new incremental algorithm for efficient lifelong adaptation to dynamic environments. We develop and maintain a library that contains an infinite mixture of parameterized environment models, which is equivalent to clustering environment parameters in a latent space. The prior distribution over the mixture is formulated as a Chinese restaurant process (CRP), which incrementally instantiates new environment models without any external information to signal environmental changes in advance. During lifelong learning, we employ the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with online Bayesian inference to update the mixture in a fully incremental manner. In EM, the E-step involves estimating the posterior expectation of environment-to-cluster assignments, while the M-step updates the environment parameters for future learning. This method allows for all environment models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for environmental changes and old models retrieved when previously seen environments are encountered again. Experiments demonstrate that LLIRL outperforms relevant existing methods, and enables effective incremental adaptation to various dynamic environments for lifelong learning.",0

"Consider the following instance of the Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning (OMRL) problem: given the complete training logs of $N$ conventional RL agents, trained on $N$ different tasks, design a meta-agent that can quickly maximize reward in a new, unseen task from the same task distribution. In particular, while each conventional RL agent explored and exploited its own different task, the meta-agent must identify regularities in the data that lead to effective exploration/exploitation in the unseen task. Here, we take a Bayesian RL (BRL) view, and seek to learn a Bayes-optimal policy from the offline data. Building on the recent VariBAD BRL approach, we develop an off-policy BRL method that learns to plan an exploration strategy based on an adaptive neural belief estimate. However, learning to infer such a belief from offline data brings a new identifiability issue we term MDP ambiguity. We characterize the problem, and suggest resolutions via data collection and modification procedures. Finally, we evaluate our framework on a diverse set of domains, including difficult sparse reward tasks, and demonstrate learning of effective exploration behavior that is qualitatively different from the exploration used by any RL agent in the data.",0

"Many control tasks exhibit similar dynamics that can be modeled as having common latent structure. Hidden-Parameter Markov Decision Processes (HiP-MDPs) explicitly model this structure to improve sample efficiency in multi-task settings. However, this setting makes strong assumptions on the observability of the state that limit its application in real-world scenarios with rich observation spaces. In this work, we leverage ideas of common structure from the HiP-MDP setting, and extend it to enable robust state abstractions inspired by Block MDPs. We derive instantiations of this new framework for both multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) and meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) settings. Further, we provide transfer and generalization bounds based on task and state similarity, along with sample complexity bounds that depend on the aggregate number of samples across tasks, rather than the number of tasks, a significant improvement over prior work that use the same environment assumptions. To further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we empirically compare and show improvement over multi-task and meta-reinforcement learning baselines.",0

"A pruning-based AutoML framework for run-time reconfigurability, namely RT3, is proposed in this work. This enables Transformer-based large Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to be efficiently executed on resource-constrained mobile devices and reconfigured (i.e., switching models for dynamic hardware conditions) at run-time. Such reconfigurability is the key to save energy for battery-powered mobile devices, which widely use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique for hardware reconfiguration to prolong battery life. In this work, we creatively explore a hybrid block-structured pruning (BP) and pattern pruning (PP) for Transformer-based models and first attempt to combine hardware and software reconfiguration to maximally save energy for battery-powered mobile devices. Specifically, RT3 integrates two-level optimizations: First, it utilizes an efficient BP as the first-step compression for resource-constrained mobile devices; then, RT3 heuristically generates a shrunken search space based on the first level optimization and searches multiple pattern sets with diverse sparsity for PP via reinforcement learning to support lightweight software reconfiguration, which corresponds to available frequency levels of DVFS (i.e., hardware reconfiguration). At run-time, RT3 can switch the lightweight pattern sets within 45ms to guarantee the required real-time constraint at different frequency levels. Results further show that RT3 can prolong battery life over 4x improvement with less than 1% accuracy loss for Transformer and 1.5% score decrease for DistilBERT.",0

"The actor-critic (AC) algorithm is a popular method to find an optimal policy in reinforcement learning. In the infinite horizon scenario, the finite-sample convergence rate for the AC and natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithms has been established recently, but under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling and single-sample update at each iteration. In contrast, this paper characterizes the convergence rate and sample complexity of AC and NAC under Markovian sampling, with mini-batch data for each iteration, and with actor having general policy class approximation. We show that the overall sample complexity for a mini-batch AC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary point improves the best known sample complexity of AC by an order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log(1/\epsilon))$, and the overall sample complexity for a mini-batch NAC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate globally optimal point improves the existing sample complexity of NAC by an order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}/\log(1/\epsilon))$.

"Many reinforcement learning algorithms can be seen as versions of approximate policy iteration (API). While standard API often performs poorly, it has been shown that learning can be stabilized by regularizing each policy update by the KL-divergence to the previous policy. Popular practical algorithms such as TRPO, MPO, and VMPO replace regularization by a constraint on KL-divergence of consecutive policies, arguing that this is easier to implement and tune. In this work, we study this implementation choice in more detail. We compare the use of KL divergence as a constraint vs. as a regularizer, and point out several optimization issues with the widely-used constrained approach. We show that the constrained algorithm is not guaranteed to converge even on simple problem instances where the constrained problem can be solved exactly, and in fact incurs linear expected regret. With approximate implementation using softmax policies, we show that regularization can improve the optimization landscape of the original objective. We demonstrate these issues empirically on several bandit and RL environments.",0

"In audio-visual navigation, an agent intelligently travels through a complex, unmapped 3D environment using both sights and sounds to find a sound source (e.g., a phone ringing in another room).

In this work, we present adaptive approximate policy iteration (AAPI), a learning scheme which enjoys a $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound for undiscounted, continuing learning in uniformly ergodic MDPs. This is an improvement over the best existing bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ for the average-reward case with function approximation. Our algorithm and analysis rely on online learning techniques, where value functions are treated as losses. The main technical novelty is the use of a data-dependent adaptive learning rate coupled with a so-called optimistic prediction of upcoming losses. In addition to theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach empirically on several environments.",0

"Model-based meta-reinforcement learning (RL) methods have recently shown to be a promising approach to improving the sample efficiency of RL in multi-task settings. However, the theoretical understanding of those methods is yet to be established, and there is currently no theoretical guarantee of their performance in a real-world environment. In this paper, we analyze the performance guarantee of model-based meta-RL methods by extending the theorems proposed by Janner et al. (2019).

"Differential games, in particular two-player sequential zero-sum games (a.k.a. minimax optimization), have been an important modeling tool in applied science and received renewed interest in machine learning due to many recent applications, such as adversarial training, generative models and reinforcement learning. However, existing theory mostly focuses on convex-concave functions with few exceptions. In this work, we propose two novel Newton-type algorithms for nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization. We prove their local convergence at strict local minimax points, which are surrogates of global solutions. We argue that our Newton-type algorithms nicely complement existing ones in that (a) they converge faster to strict local minimax points; (b) they are much more effective when the problem is ill-conditioned; (c) their computational complexity remains similar. We verify the effectiveness of our Newton-type algorithms through experiments on training GANs which are intrinsically nonconvex and ill-conditioned.",0

"In this work, we address risk-averse Bayesadaptive reinforcement learning. We pose the problem of optimising the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the total return in Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). We show that a policy optimising CVaR in this setting is risk-averse to both the parametric uncertainty due to the prior distribution over MDPs, and the internal uncertainty due to the inherent stochasticity of MDPs. We reformulate the problem as a two-player stochastic game and propose an approximate algorithm based on Monte Carlo tree search and Bayesian optimisation.

"We study the global convergence of policy optimization for finding the Nash equilibria (NE) in zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games. To this end, we first investigate the landscape of LQ games, viewing it as a nonconvex-nonconcave saddle-point problem in the policy space. Specifically, we show that despite its nonconvexity and nonconcavity, zero-sum LQ games have the property that the stationary point of the objective function with respect to the linear feedback control policies constitutes the NE of the game. Building upon this, we develop three projected nested-gradient methods that are guaranteed to converge to the NE of the game. Moreover, we show that all of these algorithms enjoy both globally sublinear and locally linear convergence rates. Simulation results are also provided to illustrate the satisfactory convergence properties of the algorithms.

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are powerful tools for solving visuomotor decision tasks. However, the trained models are often difficult to interpret, because they are represented as end-to-end deep neural networks. In this paper, we shed light on the inner workings of such trained models by analyzing the pixels that they attend to during task execution, and comparing them with the pixels attended to by humans executing the same tasks. To this end, we investigate the following two questions that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously studied. 1) How similar are the visual features learned by RL agents and humans when performing the same task? and, 2) How do similarities and differences in these learned features explain RL agents' performance on these tasks? Specifically, we compare the saliency maps of RL agents against visual attention models of human experts when learning to play Atari games.

"Reinforcement learning is about learning agent models that make the best sequential decisions in unknown environments. In an unknown environment, the agent needs to explore the environment while exploiting the collected information, which usually forms a sophisticated problem to solve. Derivative-free optimization, meanwhile, is capable of solving sophisticated problems. It commonly uses a sampling-and-updating framework to iteratively improve the solution, where exploration and exploitation are also needed to be well balanced. Therefore, derivative-free optimization deals with a similar core issue as reinforcement learning, and has been introduced in reinforcement learning approaches, under the names of learning classifier systems and neuroevolution/evolutionary reinforcement learning. Although such methods have been developed for decades, recently, derivative-free reinforcement learning exhibits attracting increasing attention. However, recent survey on this topic is still lacking. In this article, we summarize methods of derivative-free reinforcement learning to date, and organize the methods in aspects including parameter updating, model selection, exploration, and parallel/distributed methods. Moreover, we discuss some current limitations and possible future directions, hoping that this article could bring more attentions to this topic and serve as a catalyst for developing novel and efficient approaches.",0

"Using a model of the environment, reinforcement learning agents can plan their future moves and achieve superhuman performance in board games like Chess, Shogi, and Go, while remaining relatively sample-efficient. As demonstrated by the MuZero Algorithm, the environment model can even be learned dynamically, generalizing the agent to many more tasks while at the same time achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, MuZero uses internal state representations derived from real environment states for its predictions. In this paper, we bind the model's predicted internal state representation to the environment state via two additional terms: a reconstruction model loss and a simpler consistency loss, both of which work independently and unsupervised, acting as constraints to stabilize the learning process. Our experiments show that this new integration of reconstruction model loss and simpler consistency loss provide a significant performance increase in OpenAI Gym environments. Our modifications also enable self-supervised pretraining for MuZero, so the algorithm can learn about environment dynamics before a goal is made available.",0

"We investigate the hardness of online reinforcement learning in fixed horizon, sparse linear Markov decision process (MDP), with a special focus on the high-dimensional regime where the ambient dimension is larger than the number of episodes. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we provide a lower bound showing that linear regret is generally unavoidable in this case, even if there exists a policy that collects well-conditioned data. The lower bound construction uses an MDP with a fixed number of states while the number of actions scales with the ambient dimension. Note that when the horizon is fixed to one, the case of linear stochastic bandits, the linear regret can be avoided. Second, we show that if the learner has oracle access to a policy that collects well-conditioned data then a variant of Lasso fitted Q-iteration enjoys a nearly dimension-free regret of $\tilde{O}( s^{2/3} N^{2/3})$ where $N$ is the number of episodes and $s$ is the sparsity level. This shows that in the large-action setting, the difficulty of learning can be attributed to the difficulty of finding a good exploratory policy.",0

"The human visual system contains a hierarchical sequence of modules that take part in visual perception at superordinate, basic, and subordinate categorization levels. During the last decades, various computational models have been proposed to mimic the hierarchical feed-forward processing of visual cortex, but many critical characteristics of the visual system, such actual neural processing and learning mechanisms, are ignored. Pursuing the line of biological inspiration, we propose a computational model for object recognition in different categorization levels, in which a spiking neural network equipped with the reinforcement learning rule is used as a module at each categorization level. Each module solves the object recognition problem at each categorization level, solely based on the earliest spike of class-specific neurons at its last layer, without using any external classifier. According to the required information at each categorization level, the relevant band-pass filtered images are utilized. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated by various appraisal criteria with three benchmark datasets and significant improvement in recognition accuracy of our proposed model is achieved in all experiments.",0

"Training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in high-stakes applications might be too prohibitive due to the risk associated to exploration. Thus, the agent can only use data previously collected by safe policies. While previous work considers optimizing the average performance using offline data, we focus on optimizing a risk-averse criteria, namely the CVaR. In particular, we present the Offline Risk-Averse Actor-Critic (O-RAAC), a model-free RL algorithm that is able to learn risk-averse policies in a fully offline setting. We show that O-RAAC learns policies with higher CVaR than risk-neutral approaches in different robot control tasks. Furthermore, considering risk-averse criteria guarantees distributional robustness of the average performance with respect to particular distribution shifts. We demonstrate empirically that in the presence of natural distribution-shifts, O-RAAC learns policies with good average performance.",0

"We propose a novel framework for value function factorization in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) using graph neural networks (GNNs). In particular, we consider the team of agents as the set of nodes of a complete directed graph, whose edge weights are governed by an attention mechanism. Building upon this underlying graph, we introduce a mixing GNN module, which is responsible for i) factorizing the team state-action value function into individual per-agent observation-action value functions, and ii) explicit credit assignment to each agent in terms of fractions of the global team reward. Our approach, which we call GraphMIX, follows the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, enabling the agents to make their decisions independently once training is completed. We show the superiority of GraphMIX as compared to the state-of-the-art on several scenarios in the StarCraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC) benchmark. We further demonstrate how GraphMIX can be used in conjunction with a recent hierarchical MARL architecture to both improve the agents' performance and enable fine-tuning them on mismatched test scenarios with higher numbers of agents and/or actions.",0

"The stringent requirements of mobile edge computing (MEC) applications and functions fathom the high capacity and dense deployment of MEC hosts to the upcoming wireless networks. However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can significantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a base station (BS) unit can act as a self-powered BS. In this paper, an effective energy dispatch mechanism for self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied. First, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while fulfilling the energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution is proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning (MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy consumption and generation while each BS transfers time-varying features to a meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy dispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with its own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy dispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally, the proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic, asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed MAMRL model can reduce up to 11% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4% the energy cost (with 95.8% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline methods.",0

"Value-based methods of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially the value decomposition methods, have been demonstrated on a range of challenging cooperative tasks. However, current methods pay little attention to the interaction between agents, which is essential to teamwork in games or real life. This limits the efficiency of value-based MARL algorithms in the two aspects: collaborative exploration and value function estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative MARL algorithm named as interactive actor-critic~(IAC), which models the interaction of agents from the perspectives of policy and value function. On the policy side, a multi-agent joint stochastic policy is introduced by adopting a collaborative exploration module, which is trained by maximizing the entropy-regularized expected return. On the value side, we use the shared attention mechanism to estimate the value function of each agent, which takes the impact of the teammates into consideration. At the implementation level, we extend the value decomposition methods to continuous control tasks and evaluate IAC on benchmark tasks including classic control and multi-agent particle environments.

The existing DSN scheduling process operates on a rolling weekly basis and is time-consuming; for a given week, generation of the final baseline schedule of spacecraft tracking passes takes roughly 5 months from the initial requirements submission deadline, with several weeks of peer-to-peer negotiations in between. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to generate candidate DSN schedules from mission requests and spacecraft ephemeris data with demonstrated capability to address real-world operational constraints. A deep RL agent is developed that takes mission requests for a given week as input, and interacts with a DSN scheduling environment to allocate tracks such that its reward signal is maximized. A comparison is made between an agent trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and its random, untrained counterpart. The results represent a proof-of-concept that, given a well-shaped reward signal, a deep RL agent can learn the complex heuristics used by experts to schedule the DSN. A trained agent can potentially be used to generate candidate schedules to bootstrap the scheduling process and thus reduce the turnaround cycle for DSN scheduling.",0

"In recent years, reinforcement learning has seen interest because of deep Q-Learning, where the model is a convolutional neural network. Deep Q-Learning has shown promising results in games such as Atari and AlphaGo. Instead of learning the entire Q-table, it learns an estimate of the Q function that determines a state's policy action. We use Q-Learning and deep Q-learning, to learn control policies of four constraint satisfaction games (15-Puzzle, Minesweeper, 2048, and Sudoku). 15-Puzzle is a sliding permutation puzzle and provides a challenge in addressing its large state space. Minesweeper and Sudoku involve partially observable states and guessing. 2048 is also a sliding puzzle but allows for easier state representation (compared to 15-Puzzle) and uses interesting reward shaping to solve the game. These games offer unique insights into the potential and limits of reinforcement learning. The Q agent is trained with no rules of the game, with only the reward corresponding to each state's action. Our unique contribution is in choosing the reward structure, state representation, and formulation of the deep neural network. For low shuffle, 15-Puzzle, achieves a 100% win rate, the medium and high shuffle achieve about 43% and 22% win rates respectively. On a standard 16x16 Minesweeper board, both low and high-density boards achieve close to 45% win rate, whereas medium density boards have a low win rate of 15%. For 2048, the 1024 win rate was achieved with significant ease (100%) with high win rates for 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384 as 40%, 0.05%, 0.01% and 0.004% , respectively. The easy Sudoku games had a win rate of 7%, while medium and hard games had 2.1% and 1.2% win rates, respectively. This paper explores the environment complexity and behavior of a subset of constraint games using reward structures which can get us closer to understanding how humans learn.",0

"Reinforcement learning has enabled agents to solve challenging tasks in unknown environments. However, manually crafting reward functions can be time consuming, expensive, and error prone to human error. Competing objectives have been proposed for agents to learn without external supervision, but it has been unclear how well they reflect task rewards or human behavior. To accelerate the development of intrinsic objectives, we retrospectively compute potential objectives on pre-collected datasets of agent behavior, rather than optimizing them online, and compare them by analyzing their correlations. We study input entropy, information gain, and empowerment across seven agents, three Atari games, and the 3D game Minecraft. We find that all three intrinsic objectives correlate more strongly with a human behavior similarity metric than with task reward. Moreover, input entropy and information gain correlate more strongly with human similarity than task reward does, suggesting the use of intrinsic objectives for designing agents that behave similarly to human players.",0

"In this paper, we investigate the problem of scheduling and resource allocation over a time varying set of clients with heterogeneous demands.In this context, a service provider has to schedule traffic destined to users with different classes of requirements and to allocate bandwidth resources over time as a means to efficiently satisfy service demands within a limited time horizon. This is a highly intricate problem, in particular in wireless communication systems, and solutions may involve tools stemming from diverse fields, including combinatorics and constrained optimization. Although recent work has successfully proposed solutions based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), the challenging setting of heterogeneous user traffic and demands has not been addressed. We propose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm that combines state-of-the-art techniques, namely Distributional RL and Deep Sets, to train a model for heterogeneous traffic scheduling. We test on diverse scenarios with different time dependence dynamics, users' requirements, and resources available, demonstrating consistent results using both synthetic and real data. We evaluate the algorithm on a wireless communication setting using both synthetic and real data and show significant gains in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) defined by the classes, against state-of-the-art conventional algorithms from combinatorics, optimization and scheduling metric(e.g. Knapsack, Integer Linear Programming, Frank-Wolfe, Exponential Rule).",0

"How much credit (or blame) should an action taken in a state get for a future reward? This is the fundamental temporal credit assignment problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). One of the earliest and still most widely used heuristics is to assign this credit based on a scalar coefficient $\lambda$ (treated as a hyperparameter) raised to the power of the time interval between the state-action and the reward. In this empirical paper, we explore heuristics based on more general pairwise weightings that are functions of the state in which the action was taken, the state at the time of the reward, as well as the time interval between the two. Of course it isn't clear what these pairwise weight functions should be, and because they are too complex to be treated as hyperparameters we develop a metagradient procedure for learning these weight functions during the usual RL training of a policy. Our empirical work shows that it is often possible to learn these pairwise weight functions during learning of the policy to achieve better performance than competing approaches.",0
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces the challenge of determining the appropriate credit or blame for a state's action in relation to a future reward. This is known as the temporal credit assignment problem. The traditional heuristic involves assigning a scalar coefficient, $\lambda$, raised to the power of the time interval between the state-action and reward. However, this paper explores alternative heuristics based on pairwise weightings that consider the state of the action and reward, as well as the time interval. Developing effective weight functions is complex and cannot be treated as hyperparameters. Therefore, a metagradient procedure is proposed to learn these functions during policy training. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach can lead to superior performance compared to other approaches.",1
"In this work, we consider the regret minimization problem for reinforcement learning in latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDP). In an LMDP, an MDP is randomly drawn from a set of $M$ possible MDPs at the beginning of the interaction, but the identity of the chosen MDP is not revealed to the agent. We first show that a general instance of LMDPs requires at least $\Omega((SA)^M)$ episodes to even approximate the optimal policy. Then, we consider sufficient assumptions under which learning good policies requires polynomial number of episodes. We show that the key link is a notion of separation between the MDP system dynamics. With sufficient separation, we provide an efficient algorithm with local guarantee, {\it i.e.,} providing a sublinear regret guarantee when we are given a good initialization. Finally, if we are given standard statistical sufficiency assumptions common in the Predictive State Representation (PSR) literature (e.g., Boots et al.) and a reachability assumption, we show that the need for initialization can be removed.",0
"The focus of our research is on minimizing regret in reinforcement learning within latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDP). In an LMDP, one of M possible MDPs is randomly selected for interaction without disclosing its identity to the agent. Our study reveals that an LMDP instance necessitates a minimum of $\Omega((SA)^M)$ episodes to obtain an approximate optimal policy. However, we establish that with satisfactory assumptions, learning effective policies can be accomplished within a polynomial number of episodes. The key factor is the separation between the MDP system dynamics. We present an efficient algorithm that provides a sublinear regret guarantee with a good initialization. Furthermore, if standard statistical sufficiency assumptions as described in the Predictive State Representation literature are met, and a reachability assumption is added, the necessity for initialization can be eliminated.",1
"Sampled environment transitions are a critical input to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Current DRL benchmarks often allow for the cheap and easy generation of large amounts of samples such that perceived progress in DRL does not necessarily correspond to improved sample efficiency. As simulating real world processes is often prohibitively hard and collecting real world experience is costly, sample efficiency is an important indicator for economically relevant applications of DRL. We investigate progress in sample efficiency on Atari games and continuous control tasks by comparing the number of samples that a variety of algorithms need to reach a given performance level according to training curves in the corresponding publications. We find exponential progress in sample efficiency with estimated doubling times of around 10 to 18 months on Atari, 5 to 24 months on state-based continuous control and of around 4 to 9 months on pixel-based continuous control depending on the specific task and performance level.",0

"When solving a complex task, humans will spontaneously form teams and to complete different parts of the whole task, respectively. Meanwhile, the cooperation between teammates will improve efficiency. However, for current cooperative MARL methods, the cooperation team is constructed through either heuristics or end-to-end blackbox optimization. In order to improve the efficiency of cooperation and exploration, we propose a structured diversification emergence MARL framework named {\sc{Rochico}} based on reinforced organization control and hierarchical consensus learning. {\sc{Rochico}} first learns an adaptive grouping policy through the organization control module, which is established by independent multi-agent reinforcement learning. Further, the hierarchical consensus module based on the hierarchical intentions with consensus constraint is introduced after team formation. Simultaneously, utilizing the hierarchical consensus module and a self-supervised intrinsic reward enhanced decision module, the proposed cooperative MARL algorithm {\sc{Rochico}} can output the final diversified multi-agent cooperative policy. All three modules are organically combined to promote the structured diversification emergence. Comparative experiments on four large-scale cooperation tasks show that {\sc{Rochico}} is significantly better than the current SOTA algorithms in terms of exploration efficiency and cooperation strength.",0

"Bootstrapping provides a flexible and effective approach for assessing the quality of batch reinforcement learning, yet its theoretical property is less understood. In this paper, we study the use of bootstrapping in off-policy evaluation (OPE), and in particular, we focus on the fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) that is known to be minimax-optimal in the tabular and linear-model cases. We propose a bootstrapping FQE method for inferring the distribution of the policy evaluation error and show that this method is asymptotically efficient and distributionally consistent for off-policy statistical inference. To overcome the computation limit of bootstrapping, we further adapt a subsampling procedure that improves the runtime by an order of magnitude. We numerically evaluate the bootrapping method in classical RL environments for confidence interval estimation, estimating the variance of off-policy evaluator, and estimating the correlation between multiple off-policy evaluators.",0

"Two-dimensional nanomaterials, such as graphene, have been extensively studied because of their outstanding physical properties. Structure and geometry optimization of nanopores on such materials is beneficial for their performances in real-world engineering applications, like water desalination. However, the optimization process often involves very large number of experiments or simulations which are expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a graphene nanopore optimization framework via the combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for efficient water desalination. The DRL agent controls the growth of nanopore by determining the atom to be removed at each timestep, while the CNN predicts the performance of nanoporus graphene for water desalination: the water flux and ion rejection at a certain external pressure. With the synchronous feedback from CNN-accelerated desalination performance prediction, our DRL agent can optimize the nanoporous graphene efficiently in an online manner. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on promising DRL-designed graphene nanopores show that they have higher water flux while maintaining rival ion rejection rate compared to the normal circular nanopores. Semi-oval shape with rough edges geometry of DRL-designed pores is found to be the key factor for their high water desalination performance. Ultimately, this study shows that DRL can be a powerful tool for material design.",0

"Active inference may be defined as Bayesian modeling of a brain with a biologically plausible model of the agent. Its primary idea relies on the free energy principle and the prior preference of the agent. An agent will choose an action that leads to its prior preference for a future observation. In this paper, we claim that active inference can be interpreted using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and find a theoretical connection between them. We extend the concept of expected free energy (EFE), which is a core quantity in active inference, and claim that EFE can be treated as a negative value function. Motivated by the concept of prior preference and a theoretical connection, we propose a simple but novel method for learning a prior preference from experts. This illustrates that the problem with inverse RL can be approached with a new perspective of active inference. Experimental results of prior preference learning show the possibility of active inference with EFE-based rewards and its application to an inverse RL problem.",0

"Intelligent agents can cope with sensory-rich environments by learning task-agnostic state abstractions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to approximate causal states, which are the coarsest partition of the joint history of actions and observations in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). Our method learns approximate causal state representations from RNNs trained to predict subsequent observations given the history. We demonstrate that these learned state representations are useful for learning policies efficiently in reinforcement learning problems with rich observation spaces. We connect causal states with causal feature sets from the causal inference literature, and also provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the continuous version of this causal state representation under Lipschitz assumptions by proving equivalence to bisimulation, a relation between behaviorally equivalent systems. This allows for lower bounds on the optimal value function of the learned representation, which is tight given certain assumptions. Finally, we empirically evaluate causal state representations using multiple partially observable tasks and compare with prior methods.",0

"Centralized Training for Decentralized Execution, where agents are trained offline using centralized information but execute in a decentralized manner online, has gained popularity in the multi-agent reinforcement learning community. In particular, actor-critic methods with a centralized critic and decentralized actors are a common instance of this idea. However, the implications of using a centralized critic in this context are not fully discussed and understood even though it is the standard choice of many algorithms. We therefore formally analyze centralized and decentralized critic approaches, providing a deeper understanding of the implications of critic choice. Because our theory makes unrealistic assumptions, we also empirically compare the centralized and decentralized critic methods over a wide set of environments to validate our theories and to provide practical advice. We show that there exist misconceptions regarding centralized critics in the current literature and show that the centralized critic design is not strictly beneficial, but rather both centralized and decentralized critics have different pros and cons that should be taken into account by algorithm designers.",0

"Exploration in environments with sparse rewards is difficult for artificial agents. Curiosity driven learning -- using feed-forward prediction errors as intrinsic rewards -- has achieved some success in these scenarios, but fails when faced with action-dependent noise sources. We present aleatoric mapping agents (AMAs), a neuroscience inspired solution modeled on the cholinergic system of the mammalian brain. AMAs aim to explicitly ascertain which dynamics of the environment are unpredictable, regardless of whether those dynamics are induced by the actions of the agent. This is achieved by generating separate forward predictions for the mean and variance of future states and reducing intrinsic rewards for those transitions with high aleatoric variance. We show AMAs are able to effectively circumvent action-dependent stochastic traps that immobilise conventional curiosity driven agents.

"Despite definite success in deep reinforcement learning problems, actor-critic algorithms are still confronted with sample inefficiency in complex environments, particularly in tasks where efficient exploration is a bottleneck. These methods consider a policy (the actor) and a value function (the critic) whose respective losses are built using different motivations and approaches. This paper introduces a third protagonist: the adversary. While the adversary mimics the actor by minimizing the KL-divergence between their respective action distributions, the actor, in addition to learning to solve the task, tries to differentiate itself from the adversary predictions. This novel objective stimulates the actor to follow strategies that could not have been correctly predicted from previous trajectories, making its behavior innovative in tasks where the reward is extremely rare. Our experimental analysis shows that the resulting Adversarially Guided Actor-Critic (AGAC) algorithm leads to more exhaustive exploration. Notably, AGAC outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on a set of various hard-exploration and procedurally-generated tasks.",0

"This work explores learning agent-agnostic synthetic environments (SEs) for Reinforcement Learning. SEs act as a proxy for target environments and allow agents to be trained more efficiently than when directly trained on the target environment. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem and represent an SE as a neural network. By using Natural Evolution Strategies and a population of SE parameter vectors, we train agents in the inner loop on evolving SEs while in the outer loop we use the performance on the target task as a score for meta-updating the SE population. We show empirically that our method is capable of learning SEs for two discrete-action-space tasks (CartPole-v0 and Acrobot-v1) that allow us to train agents more robustly and with up to 60% fewer steps. Not only do we show in experiments with 4000 evaluations that the SEs are robust against hyperparameter changes such as the learning rate, batch sizes and network sizes, we also show that SEs trained with DDQN agents transfer in limited ways to a discrete-action-space version of TD3 and very well to Dueling DDQN.",0

"Although reinforcement learning has been successfully applied in many domains in recent years, we still lack agents that can systematically generalize. While relational inductive biases that fit a task can improve generalization of RL agents, these biases are commonly hard-coded directly in the agent's neural architecture. In this work, we show that we can incorporate relational inductive biases, encoded in the form of relational graphs, into agents. Based on this insight, we propose Grid-to-Graph (GTG), a mapping from grid structures to relational graphs that carry useful spatial relational inductive biases when processed through a Relational Graph Convolution Network (R-GCN). We show that, with GTG, R-GCNs generalize better both in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution compared to baselines based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Neural Logic Machines on challenging procedurally generated environments and MinAtar.

"The question of how to determine which states and actions are responsible for a certain outcome is known as the credit assignment problem and remains a central research question in reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence. Eligibility traces enable efficient credit assignment to the recent sequence of states and actions experienced by the agent, but not to counterfactual sequences that could also have led to the current state. In this work, we introduce expected eligibility traces. Expected traces allow, with a single update, to update states and actions that could have preceded the current state, even if they did not do so on this occasion. We discuss when expected traces provide benefits over classic (instantaneous) traces in temporal-difference learning, and show that sometimes substantial improvements can be attained. We provide a way to smoothly interpolate between instantaneous and expected traces by a mechanism similar to bootstrapping, which ensures that the resulting algorithm is a strict generalisation of TD($\lambda$). Finally, we discuss possible extensions and connections to related ideas, such as successor features.",0
"The problem of determining which actions and states are responsible for a certain outcome is referred to as the credit assignment problem, which is a key research question in artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning. Although eligibility traces are useful in assigning credit to the immediate sequence of states and actions encountered by the agent, they cannot be used to assign credit to hypothetical sequences that could have led to the current state. Our study introduces expected eligibility traces, which enable updating of states and actions that could have preceded the current state, even if they did not do so on the current occasion. We explore the benefits of using expected traces over instantaneous traces in temporal-difference learning, and demonstrate that significant improvements can sometimes be achieved. We also propose a technique for smoothly transitioning between instantaneous and expected traces, using a bootstrapping mechanism that guarantees the resulting algorithm is a strict generalization of TD($\lambda$). Finally, we examine potential extensions and connections to related concepts, such as successor features.",1
"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims at learning a good policy from a batch of collected data, without extra interactions with the environment during training. However, current offline RL benchmarks commonly have a large reality gap, because they involve large datasets collected by highly exploratory policies, and the trained policy is directly evaluated in the environment. In real-world situations, running a highly exploratory policy is prohibited to ensure system safety, the data is commonly very limited, and a trained policy should be well validated before deployment. In this paper, we present a near real-world offline RL benchmark, named NeoRL, which contains datasets from various domains with controlled sizes, and extra test datasets for policy validation. We evaluate existing offline RL algorithms on NeoRL and argue that the performance of a policy should also be compared with the deterministic version of the behavior policy, instead of the dataset reward. The empirical results demonstrate that the tested offline RL algorithms become less competitive to the deterministic policy on many datasets, and the offline policy evaluation hardly helps. The NeoRL suit can be found at http://polixir.ai/research/neorl. We hope this work will shed some light on future research and draw more attention when deploying RL in real-world systems.",0
"The objective of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a proficient policy by using a set of collected data without further interactions with the environment during training. Nonetheless, current offline RL benchmarks possess a substantial reality gap as they make use of large datasets gathered by highly exploratory policies, and the trained policy is assessed directly in the environment. In real-life scenarios, the use of a highly exploratory policy is not permissible for system safety, and the data available is usually limited. Furthermore, a trained policy must be appropriately validated before deployment. In this study, we introduce NeoRL, which is a nearly real-world offline RL benchmark. It encompasses datasets from different domains with controlled sizes, and additional test datasets for policy validation. We assess existing offline RL algorithms on NeoRL and argue that the performance of a policy should be evaluated against the deterministic version of the behavior policy, instead of the dataset reward.

"Every living organism struggles against disruptive environmental forces to carve out and maintain an orderly niche. We propose that such a struggle to achieve and preserve order might offer a principle for the emergence of useful behaviors in artificial agents. We formalize this idea into an unsupervised reinforcement learning method called surprise minimizing reinforcement learning (SMiRL). SMiRL alternates between learning a density model to evaluate the surprise of a stimulus, and improving the policy to seek more predictable stimuli. The policy seeks out stable and repeatable situations that counteract the environment's prevailing sources of entropy. This might include avoiding other hostile agents, or finding a stable, balanced pose for a bipedal robot in the face of disturbance forces. We demonstrate that our surprise minimizing agents can successfully play Tetris, Doom, control a humanoid to avoid falls, and navigate to escape enemies in a maze without any task-specific reward supervision. We further show that SMiRL can be used together with standard task rewards to accelerate reward-driven learning.",0

"We consider convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble learning with the objective function inspired by least action principle; it includes resource consumption component. We teach an agent to perceive images through the set of pre-trained classifiers and want the resulting dynamically configured system to unfold the computational graph with the trajectory that refers to the minimal number of operations and maximal expected accuracy. The proposed agent's architecture implicitly approximates the required classifier selection function with the help of reinforcement learning.

"In recent years, $Q$-learning has become indispensable for model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However, it suffers from well-known problems such as under- and overestimation bias of the value, which may adversely affect the policy learning. To resolve this issue, we propose a MFRL framework that is augmented with the components of model-based RL. Specifically, we propose to estimate not only the $Q$-values but also both the transition and the reward with a shared network. We further utilize the estimated reward from the model estimators for $Q$-learning, which promotes interaction between the estimators. We show that the proposed scheme, called Model-augmented $Q$-learning (MQL), obtains a policy-invariant solution which is identical to the solution obtained by learning with true reward. Finally, we also provide a trick to prioritize past experiences in the replay buffer by utilizing model-estimation errors. We experimentally validate MQL built upon state-of-the-art off-policy MFRL methods, and show that MQL largely improves their performance and convergence. The proposed scheme is simple to implement and does not require additional training cost.",0

"Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning have been largely limited in training one model from scratch for every new task. The limitation is due to the restricted model architecture related to fixed input and output dimensions. This hinders the experience accumulation and transfer of the learned agent over tasks with diverse levels of difficulty (e.g. 3 vs 3 or 5 vs 6 multi-agent games). In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore a universal multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline, designing one single architecture to fit tasks with the requirement of different observation and action configurations. Unlike previous RNN-based models, we utilize a transformer-based model to generate a flexible policy by decoupling the policy distribution from the intertwined input observation with an importance weight measured by the merits of the self-attention mechanism. Compared to a standard transformer block, the proposed model, named as Universal Policy Decoupling Transformer (UPDeT), further relaxes the action restriction and makes the multi-agent task's decision process more explainable. UPDeT is general enough to be plugged into any multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline and equip them with strong generalization abilities that enables the handling of multiple tasks at a time. Extensive experiments on large-scale SMAC multi-agent competitive games demonstrate that the proposed UPDeT-based multi-agent reinforcement learning achieves significant results relative to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating advantageous transfer capability in terms of both performance and training speed (10 times faster).",0

"Thompson sampling is a well-known approach for balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning. It requires the posterior distribution of value-action functions to be maintained; this is generally intractable for tasks that have a high dimensional state-action space. We derive a variational Thompson sampling approximation for DQNs which uses a deep network whose parameters are perturbed by a learned variational noise distribution. We interpret the successful NoisyNets method \cite{fortunato2018noisy} as an approximation to the variational Thompson sampling method that we derive. Further, we propose State Aware Noisy Exploration (SANE) which seeks to improve on NoisyNets by allowing a non-uniform perturbation, where the amount of parameter perturbation is conditioned on the state of the agent. This is done with the help of an auxiliary perturbation module, whose output is state dependent and is learnt end to end with gradient descent. We hypothesize that such state-aware noisy exploration is particularly useful in problems where exploration in certain \textit{high risk} states may result in the agent failing badly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the state-aware exploration method in the off-policy setting by augmenting DQNs with the auxiliary perturbation module.",0

"In the practice of sequential decision making, agents are often designed to sense state at regular intervals of $d$ time steps, $d > 1$, ignoring state information in between sensing steps. While it is clear that this practice can reduce sensing and compute costs, recent results indicate a further benefit. On many Atari console games, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms deliver substantially better policies when run with $d > 1$ -- in fact with $d$ even as high as $180$. In this paper, we investigate the role of the parameter $d$ in RL; $d$ is called the ""frame-skip"" parameter, since states in the Atari domain are images. For evaluating a fixed policy, we observe that under standard conditions, frame-skipping does not affect asymptotic consistency. Depending on other parameters, it can possibly even benefit learning. To use $d > 1$ in the control setting, one must first specify which $d$-step open-loop action sequences can be executed in between sensing steps. We focus on ""action-repetition"", the common restriction of this choice to $d$-length sequences of the same action. We define a task-dependent quantity called the ""price of inertia"", in terms of which we upper-bound the loss incurred by action-repetition. We show that this loss may be offset by the gain brought to learning by a smaller task horizon. Our analysis is supported by experiments on different tasks and learning algorithms.",0

"Model-based algorithms -- algorithms that explore the environment through building and utilizing an estimated model -- are widely used in reinforcement learning practice and theoretically shown to achieve optimal sample efficiency for single-agent reinforcement learning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, for multi-agent reinforcement learning in Markov games, the current best known sample complexity for model-based algorithms is rather suboptimal and compares unfavorably against recent model-free approaches. In this paper, we present a sharp analysis of model-based self-play algorithms for multi-agent Markov games. We design an algorithm -- Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (Nash-VI) for two-player zero-sum Markov games that is able to output an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash policy in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^3SAB/\epsilon^2)$ episodes of game playing, where $S$ is the number of states, $A,B$ are the number of actions for the two players respectively, and $H$ is the horizon length. This significantly improves over the best known model-based guarantee of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^4S^2AB/\epsilon^2)$, and is the first that matches the information-theoretic lower bound $\Omega(H^3S(A+B)/\epsilon^2)$ except for a $\min\{A,B\}$ factor. In addition, our guarantee compares favorably against the best known model-free algorithm if $\min \{A,B\}=o(H^3)$, and outputs a single Markov policy while existing sample-efficient model-free algorithms output a nested mixture of Markov policies that is in general non-Markov and rather inconvenient to store and execute. We further adapt our analysis to designing a provably efficient task-agnostic algorithm for zero-sum Markov games, and designing the first line of provably sample-efficient algorithms for multi-player general-sum Markov games.",0

"Using the policy gradient algorithm, we train a single-hidden-layer neural network to balance a physically accurate simulation of a single inverted pendulum. The trained weights and biases can then be transferred to a physical agent, where they are robust enough to to balance a real inverted pendulum. This hybrid approach of training a simulation allows thousands of trial runs to be completed orders of magnitude faster than would be possible in the real world, resulting in greatly reduced training time and more iterations, producing a more robust model. When compared with existing reinforcement learning methods, the resulting control is smoother, learned faster, and able to withstand forced disturbances.",0
"By employing the policy gradient algorithm, we educate a neural network with a single hidden layer to stabilize a precise simulation of a sole inverted pendulum. Once the weights and biases have been trained, they can be conveniently transferred to an actual agent, rendering them sufficiently robust to stabilize a factual inverted pendulum. This method of simulating and educating allows for the completion of thousands of trial runs much faster than what is achievable in reality, thus reducing training time significantly and enhancing iterations, leading to a more resilient model. When compared with current reinforcement learning methods, the outcome of the control is more fluent, learned at a quicker pace, and has the capability to endure forced disturbances.",1
"We study online learning in unknown Markov games, a problem that arises in episodic multi-agent reinforcement learning where the actions of the opponents are unobservable. We show that in this challenging setting, achieving sublinear regret against the best response in hindsight is statistically hard. We then consider a weaker notion of regret by competing with the \emph{minimax value} of the game, and present an algorithm that achieves a sublinear $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{2/3})$ regret after $K$ episodes. This is the first sublinear regret bound (to our knowledge) for online learning in unknown Markov games. Importantly, our regret bound is independent of the size of the opponents' action spaces. As a result, even when the opponents' actions are fully observable, our regret bound improves upon existing analysis (e.g., (Xie et al., 2020)) by an exponential factor in the number of opponents.",0

"The offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting (also known as full batch RL), where a policy is learned from a static dataset, is compelling as progress enables RL methods to take advantage of large, previously-collected datasets, much like how the rise of large datasets has fueled results in supervised learning.

"Experience replay enables off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) agents to utilize past experiences to maximize the cumulative reward. Prioritized experience replay that weighs experiences by the magnitude of their temporal-difference error ($|\text{TD}|$) significantly improves the learning efficiency. But how $|\text{TD}|$ is related to the importance of experience is not well understood. We address this problem from an economic perspective, by linking $|\text{TD}|$ to value of experience, which is defined as the value added to the cumulative reward by accessing the experience. We theoretically show the value metrics of experience are upper-bounded by $|\text{TD}|$ for Q-learning. Furthermore, we successfully extend our theoretical framework to maximum-entropy RL by deriving the lower and upper bounds of these value metrics for soft Q-learning, which turn out to be the product of $|\text{TD}|$ and ""on-policyness"" of the experiences. Our framework links two important quantities in RL: $|\text{TD}|$ and value of experience. We empirically show that the bounds hold in practice, and experience replay using the upper bound as priority improves maximum-entropy RL in Atari games.",0

"Model compression is an essential technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on power and memory-constrained resources. However, existing model-compression methods often rely on human expertise and focus on parameters' local importance, ignoring the rich topology information within DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage graph embedding technique based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify the DNNs' topology and use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a suitable compression policy.

Our results extend Blackwell's approachability theorem (Blackwell, 1956) to tabular RL, where strategic exploration becomes essential. The algorithms presented are adaptive; their guarantees hold even without Blackwell's approachability condition. If the opponents use fixed policies, we give an improved rate of approaching the target set while also tackling the more ambitious goal of simultaneously minimizing a scalar cost function. We discuss our analysis for this special case by relating our results to previous works on constrained RL. To our knowledge, this work provides the first provably efficient algorithms for vector-valued Markov games and our theoretical guarantees are near-optimal.",0

"In this paper, we study the problem of deceptive reinforcement learning to preserve the privacy of a reward function. Reinforcement learning is the problem of finding a behaviour policy based on rewards received from exploratory behaviour. A key ingredient in reinforcement learning is a reward function, which determines how much reward (negative or positive) is given and when. However, in some situations, we may want to keep a reward function private; that is, to make it difficult for an observer to determine the reward function used. We define the problem of privacy-preserving reinforcement learning, and present two models for solving it. These models are based on dissimulation -- a form of deception that `hides the truth'. We evaluate our models both computationally and via human behavioural experiments. Results show that the resulting policies are indeed deceptive, and that participants can determine the true reward function less reliably than that of an honest agent.",0

Unfortunately, methods based on intrinsic rewards often fall short in procedurally-generated environments, where a different environment is generated in each episode so that the agent is not likely to visit the same state more than once. Motivated by how humans distinguish good exploration behaviors by looking into the entire episode, we introduce RAPID, a simple yet effective episode-level exploration method for procedurally-generated environments. RAPID regards each episode as a whole and gives an episodic exploration score from both per-episode and long-term views. Those highly scored episodes are treated as good exploration behaviors and are stored in a small ranking buffer. The agent then imitates the episodes in the buffer to reproduce the past good exploration behaviors. We demonstrate our method on several procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments, a first-person-view 3D Maze navigation task from MiniWorld, and several sparse MuJoCo tasks. The results show that RAPID significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art intrinsic reward strategies in terms of sample efficiency and final performance.

"Model-free reinforcement learning faces a persistent challenge of exploration under sparse reward. To tackle this issue, current methods utilize intrinsic rewards to incentivize exploration in new or uncertain environments. However, intrinsic reward-based methods are often insufficient in procedurally-generated environments, where each episode features a unique environment, making it unlikely for the agent to revisit the same state. Inspired by how humans evaluate exploration behaviors based on the entire episode, we propose RAPID - a simple yet effective episode-level exploration method for procedurally-generated environments. RAPID considers each episode as a whole and provides an episodic exploration score from both per-episode and long-term perspectives.

"This paper is a study of reinforcement learning (RL) as an optimal-control strategy for control of nonlinear valves. It is evaluated against the PID (proportional-integral-derivative) strategy, using a unified framework. RL is an autonomous learning mechanism that learns by interacting with its environment. It is gaining increasing attention in the world of control systems as a means of building optimal-controllers for challenging dynamic and nonlinear processes. Published RL research often uses open-source tools (Python and OpenAI Gym environments). We use MATLAB's recently launched (R2019a) Reinforcement Learning Toolbox to develop the valve controller; trained using the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy-Gradient) algorithm and Simulink to simulate the nonlinear valve and create the experimental test-bench for evaluation. Simulink allows industrial engineers to quickly adapt and experiment with other systems of their choice. Results indicate that the RL controller is extremely good at tracking the signal with speed and produces a lower error with respect to the reference signal. The PID, however, is better at disturbance rejection and hence provides a longer life for the valves. Successful machine learning involves tuning many hyperparameters requiring significant investment of time and efforts. We introduce ""Graded Learning"" as a simplified, application oriented adaptation of the more formal and algorithmic ""Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning"". It is shown via experiments that it helps converge the learning task of complex non-linear real world systems. Finally, experiential learnings gained from this research are corroborated against published research.",0

"We introduce the first end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework for active high frequency trading. We train DRL agents to trade one unit of Intel Corporation stock by employing the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. The training is performed on three contiguous months of high frequency Limit Order Book data, of which the last month constitutes the validation data. In order to maximise the signal to noise ratio in the training data, we compose the latter by only selecting training samples with largest price changes. The test is then carried out on the following month of data. Hyperparameters are tuned using the Sequential Model Based Optimization technique. We consider three different state characterizations, which differ in their LOB-based meta-features. Analysing the agents' performances on test data, we argue that the agents are able to create a dynamic representation of the underlying environment. They identify occasional regularities present in the data and exploit them to create long-term profitable trading strategies. Indeed, agents learn trading strategies able to produce stable positive returns in spite of the highly stochastic and non-stationary environment.",0

"A wide range of reinforcement learning (RL) problems - including robustness, transfer learning, unsupervised RL, and emergent complexity - require specifying a distribution of tasks or environments in which a policy will be trained. However, creating a useful distribution of environments is error prone, and takes a significant amount of developer time and effort. We propose Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) as an alternative paradigm, where developers provide environments with unknown parameters, and these parameters are used to automatically produce a distribution over valid, solvable environments. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments suffer from common failure modes: domain randomization cannot generate structure or adapt the difficulty of the environment to the agent's learning progress, and minimax adversarial training leads to worst-case environments that are often unsolvable. To generate structured, solvable environments for our protagonist agent, we introduce a second, antagonist agent that is allied with the environment-generating adversary. The adversary is motivated to generate environments which maximize regret, defined as the difference between the protagonist and antagonist agent's return. We call our technique Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design (PAIRED). Our experiments demonstrate that PAIRED produces a natural curriculum of increasingly complex environments, and PAIRED agents achieve higher zero-shot transfer performance when tested in highly novel environments.",0

"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordination to efficiently solve certain tasks. Fully centralized control is often infeasible in such domains due to the size of joint action spaces. Coordination graph based formalization allows reasoning about the joint action based on the structure of interactions. However, they often require domain expertise in their design. This paper introduces the deep implicit coordination graph (DICG) architecture for such scenarios. DICG consists of a module for inferring the dynamic coordination graph structure which is then used by a graph neural network based module to learn to implicitly reason about the joint actions or values. DICG allows learning the tradeoff between full centralization and decentralization via standard actor-critic methods to significantly improve coordination for domains with large number of agents. We apply DICG to both centralized-training-centralized-execution and centralized-training-decentralized-execution regimes. We demonstrate that DICG solves the relative overgeneralization pathology in predatory-prey tasks as well as outperforms various MARL baselines on the challenging StarCraft II Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) and traffic junction environments.",0

"In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the problem of learning to act is particularly difficult because the policies of co-players may be heavily conditioned on information only observed by them. On the other hand, humans readily form beliefs about the knowledge possessed by their peers and leverage beliefs to inform decision-making. Such abilities underlie individual success in a wide range of Markov games, from bluffing in Poker to conditional cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, to convention-building in Bridge. Classical methods are usually not applicable to complex domains due to the intractable nature of hierarchical beliefs (i.e. beliefs of other agents' beliefs). We propose a scalable method to approximate these belief structures using recursive deep generative models, and to use the belief models to obtain representations useful to acting in complex tasks. Our agents trained with belief models outperform model-free baselines with equivalent representational capacity using common training paradigms. We also show that higher-order belief models outperform agents with lower-order models.",0

"The intertwined processes of learning and evolution in complex environmental niches have resulted in a remarkable diversity of morphological forms. Moreover, many aspects of animal intelligence are deeply embodied in these evolved morphologies. However, the principles governing relations between environmental complexity, evolved morphology, and the learnability of intelligent control, remain elusive, partially due to the substantial challenge of performing large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning. We introduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a novel computational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments using only low level egocentric sensory information. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate several relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence and the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, evolution rapidly selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of their descendants. In agents that learn and evolve in complex environments, this result constitutes the first demonstration of a long-conjectured morphological Baldwin effect. Third, our experiments suggest a mechanistic basis for both the Baldwin effect and the emergence of morphological intelligence through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically stable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.",0

"Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically geared towards optimizing the expected return of an agent. However, in many practical applications, low variance in the return is desired to ensure the reliability of an algorithm. In this paper, we propose on-policy and off-policy actor-critic algorithms that optimize a performance criterion involving both mean and variance in the return. Previous work uses the second moment of return to estimate the variance indirectly. Instead, we use a much simpler recently proposed direct variance estimator which updates the estimates incrementally using temporal difference methods. Using the variance-penalized criterion, we guarantee the convergence of our algorithm to locally optimal policies for finite state action Markov decision processes. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in tabular and continuous MuJoCo domains. Our approach not only performs on par with actor-critic and prior variance-penalization baselines in terms of expected return, but also generates trajectories which have lower variance in the return.",0

"In online learning an algorithm plays against an environment with losses possibly picked by an adversary at each round. The generality of this framework includes problems that are not adversarial, for example offline optimization, or saddle point problems (i.e. min max optimization). However, online algorithms are typically not designed to leverage additional structure present in non-adversarial problems. Recently, slight modifications to well-known online algorithms such as optimism and adaptive step sizes have been used in several domains to accelerate online learning -- recovering optimal rates in offline smooth optimization, and accelerating convergence to saddle points or social welfare in smooth games. In this work we introduce optimism and adaptive stepsizes to Lagrangian hedging, a class of online algorithms that includes regret-matching, and hedge (i.e. multiplicative weights). Our results include: a general general regret bound; a path length regret bound for a fixed smooth loss, applicable to an optimistic variant of regret-matching and regret-matching+; optimistic regret bounds for $\Phi$ regret, a framework that includes external, internal, and swap regret; and optimistic bounds for a family of algorithms that includes regret-matching+ as a special case.",0

"We consider the problem of offline reinforcement learning (RL) -- a well-motivated setting of RL that aims at policy optimization using only historical data. Despite its wide applicability, theoretical understandings of offline RL, such as its optimal sample complexity, remain largely open even in basic settings such as \emph{tabular} Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).   In this paper, we propose Off-Policy Double Variance Reduction (OPDVR), a new variance reduction based algorithm for offline RL. Our main result shows that OPDVR provably identifies an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with $\widetilde{O}(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ episodes of offline data in the finite-horizon stationary transition setting, where $H$ is the horizon length and $d_m$ is the minimal marginal state-action distribution induced by the behavior policy. This improves over the best known upper bound by a factor of $H$. Moreover, we establish an information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ which certifies that OPDVR is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Lastly, we show that OPDVR also achieves rate-optimal sample complexity under alternative settings such as the finite-horizon MDPs with non-stationary transitions and the infinite horizon MDPs with discounted rewards.",0

"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly used in a wide range of safety-critical applications, which require guaranteed safety (e.g., no unsafe states are ever visited) during the learning process.Unfortunately, current MARL methods do not have safety guarantees. Therefore, we present two shielding approaches for safe MARL. In centralized shielding, we synthesize a single shield to monitor all agents' joint actions and correct any unsafe action if necessary. In factored shielding, we synthesize multiple shields based on a factorization of the joint state space observed by all agents; the set of shields monitors agents concurrently and each shield is only responsible for a subset of agents at each step.Experimental results show that both approaches can guarantee the safety of agents during learning without compromising the quality of learned policies; moreover, factored shielding is more scalable in the number of agents than centralized shielding.",0

"This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning based medium access framework for wireless networks. The access problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and solved using reinforcement learning with every network node acting as a distributed learning agent. The solution components are developed step by step, starting from a single-node access scenario in which a node agent incrementally learns to control MAC layer packet loads for reining in self-collisions. The strategy is then scaled up for multi-node fully-connected scenarios by using more elaborate reward structures. It also demonstrates preliminary feasibility for more general partially connected topologies. It is shown that by learning to adjust MAC layer transmission probabilities, the protocol is not only able to attain theoretical maximum throughput at an optimal load, but unlike classical approaches, it can also retain that maximum throughput at higher loading conditions. Additionally, the mechanism is agnostic to heterogeneous loading while preserving that feature. It is also shown that access priorities of the protocol across nodes can be parametrically adjusted. Finally, it is also shown that the online learning feature of reinforcement learning is able to make the protocol adapt to time-varying loading conditions.",0
"In this article, a framework for medium access in wireless networks is proposed, which is based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The access issue is presented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and is resolved through reinforcement learning, with every node in the network working as a distributed learning agent. The solution is developed in stages, starting with a single-node access scenario where the agent learns to control MAC layer packet loads to prevent self-collisions. The approach is then extended to multi-node fully-connected scenarios, using more complex reward structures, and partial connectivity scenarios are also explored. The protocol is able to achieve maximum theoretical throughput by adjusting MAC layer transmission probabilities, and this throughput is maintained even at higher loading conditions. The protocol is insensitive to heterogeneous loading and enables access priorities to be adjusted parametrically. Furthermore, the protocol adapts to time-varying loading conditions through online learning.",1
"In most practical applications of reinforcement learning, it is untenable to maintain direct estimates for individual states; in continuous-state systems, it is impossible. Instead, researchers often leverage state similarity (whether explicitly or implicitly) to build models that can generalize well from a limited set of samples. The notion of state similarity used, and the neighbourhoods and topologies they induce, is thus of crucial importance, as it will directly affect the performance of the algorithms. Indeed, a number of recent works introduce algorithms assuming the existence of ""well-behaved"" neighbourhoods, but leave the full specification of such topologies for future work. In this paper we introduce a unified formalism for defining these topologies through the lens of metrics. We establish a hierarchy amongst these metrics and demonstrate their theoretical implications on the Markov Decision Process specifying the reinforcement learning problem. We complement our theoretical results with empirical evaluations showcasing the differences between the metrics considered.",0

"In many risk-aware and multi-objective reinforcement learning settings, the utility of the user is derived from the single execution of a policy. In these settings, making decisions based on the average future returns is not suitable. For example, in a medical setting a patient may only have one opportunity to treat their illness. When making a decision, just the expected return -- known in reinforcement learning as the value -- cannot account for the potential range of adverse or positive outcomes a decision may have. Our key insight is that we should use the distribution over expected future returns differently to represent the critical information that the agent requires at decision time. In this paper, we propose Distributional Monte Carlo Tree Search, an algorithm that learns a posterior distribution over the utility of the different possible returns attainable from individual policy executions, resulting in good policies for both risk-aware and multi-objective settings. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in multi-objective reinforcement learning for the expected utility of the returns.",0

"In this paper, we consider solving discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under the constraint that the resulting policy is stabilizing. In practice MDPs are solved based on some form of policy approximation. We will leverage recent results proposing to use Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a structured policy in the context of Reinforcement Learning to make it possible to introduce stability requirements directly inside the MPC-based policy. This will restrict the solution of the MDP to stabilizing policies by construction. The stability theory for MPC is most mature for the undiscounted MPC case. Hence, we will first show in this paper that stable discounted MDPs can be reformulated as undiscounted ones. This observation will entail that the MPC-based policy with stability requirements will produce the optimal policy for the discounted MDP if it is stable, and the best stabilizing policy otherwise.",0
"The objective of this study is to address the solution of discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while ensuring that the resultant policy is stabilizing.

This will ensure that the solution of the MDP is restricted to stabilizing policies. However, the stability theory for MPC is most developed for the undiscounted MPC scenario. Therefore, we will initially demonstrate that stable discounted MDPs can be transformed into undiscounted ones. This observation will imply that the MPC-based policy with stability requirements will yield the optimal policy for the discounted MDP if it is stable, and the best stabilizing policy if it is not stable.",1
"The area of Smart Power Grids needs to constantly improve its efficiency and resilience, to pro-vide high quality electrical power, in a resistant grid, managing faults and avoiding failures. Achieving this requires high component reliability, adequate maintenance, and a studied failure occurrence. Correct system operation involves those activities, and novel methodologies to detect, classify, and isolate faults and failures, model and simulate processes with predictive algorithms and analytics (using data analysis and asset condition to plan and perform activities). We show-case the application of a complex-adaptive, self-organizing modeling method, Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN), as a way towards the understanding of the dynamics of smart grid devices, and to model and characterize their behavior. This work demonstrates that PBNs are is equivalent to the standard Reinforcement Learning Cycle, in which the agent/model has an inter-action with its environment and receives feedback from it in the form of a reward signal. Differ-ent reward structures were created in order to characterize preferred behavior. This information can be used to guide the PBN to avoid fault conditions and failures.",0

"We study the regret of reinforcement learning from offline data generated by a fixed behavior policy in an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process (MDP). While existing analyses of common approaches, such as fitted $Q$-iteration (FQI), suggest a $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ convergence for regret, empirical behavior exhibits much faster convergence. In this paper, we present a finer regret analysis that exactly characterizes this phenomenon by providing fast rates for the regret convergence. First, we show that given any estimate for the optimal quality function $Q^*$, the regret of the policy it defines converges at a rate given by the exponentiation of the $Q^*$-estimate's pointwise convergence rate, thus speeding it up. The level of exponentiation depends on the level of noise in the decision-making problem, rather than the estimation problem. We establish such noise levels for linear and tabular MDPs as examples. Second, we provide new analyses of FQI and Bellman residual minimization to establish the correct pointwise convergence guarantees. As specific cases, our results imply $O(1/n)$ regret rates in linear cases and $\exp(-\Omega(n))$ regret rates in tabular cases.",0

This paper presents our discovery that an abstract forward model (Thought-game (TG)) combined with transfer learning is an effective way. We take StarCraft II as the study environment. With the help of a designed TG, the agent can learn a 99\% win-rate on a 64$\times$64 map against the Level-7 built-in AI, using only 1.08 hours in a single commercial machine. We also show that the TG method is not as restrictive as it was thought to be. It can work with roughly designed TGs, and can also be useful when the environment changes. Comparing with previous model-based RL, we show TG is more effective. We also present a TG hypothesis that gives the influence of fidelity levels of TG. For real games that have unequal state and action spaces, we proposed a novel XfrNet of which usefulness is validated while achieving a 90\% win-rate against the cheating Level-10 AI. We argue the TG method might shed light on further studies of efficient RL with human knowledge.",0

"This paper studies the exponential stability of random matrix products driven by a general (possibly unbounded) state space Markov chain. It is a cornerstone in the analysis of stochastic algorithms in machine learning (e.g. for parameter tracking in online learning or reinforcement learning). The existing results impose strong conditions such as uniform boundedness of the matrix-valued functions and uniform ergodicity of the Markov chains. Our main contribution is an exponential stability result for the $p$-th moment of random matrix product, provided that (i) the underlying Markov chain satisfies a super-Lyapunov drift condition, (ii) the growth of the matrix-valued functions is controlled by an appropriately defined function (related to the drift condition). Using this result, we give finite-time $p$-th moment bounds for constant and decreasing stepsize linear stochastic approximation schemes with Markovian noise on general state space. We illustrate these findings for linear value-function estimation in reinforcement learning. We provide finite-time $p$-th moment bound for various members of temporal difference (TD) family of algorithms.",0

"Reinforcement learning typically assumes that the agent observes feedback from the environment immediately, but in many real-world applications (like recommendation systems) the feedback is observed in delay. Thus, we consider online learning in episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown transitions, adversarially changing costs and unrestricted delayed feedback. That is, the costs and trajectory of episode $k$ are only available at the end of episode $k + d^k$, where the delays $d^k$ are neither identical nor bounded, and are chosen by an adversary. We present novel algorithms based on policy optimization that achieve near-optimal high-probability regret of $\widetilde O ( \sqrt{K} + \sqrt{D} )$ under full-information feedback, where $K$ is the number of episodes and $D = \sum_{k} d^k$ is the total delay. Under bandit feedback, we prove similar $\widetilde O ( \sqrt{K} + \sqrt{D} )$ regret assuming that the costs are stochastic, and $\widetilde O ( K^{2/3} + D^{2/3} )$ regret in the general case. To our knowledge, we are the first to consider the important setting of delayed feedback in adversarial MDPs.",0

"We study provably-efficient reinforcement learning in non-episodic factored Markov decision processes (FMDPs). All previous regret minimization algorithms in this setting made the strong assumption that the factored structure of the FMDP is known to the learner in advance. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm that learns the structure of the FMDP while minimizing the regret. Our algorithm is based on the optimism in face of uncertainty principle, combined with a simple statistical method for structure learning, and can be implemented efficiently given oracle-access to an FMDP planner. In addition, we give a variant of our algorithm that remains efficient even when the oracle is limited to non-factored actions, which is the case with almost all existing approximate planners.

"Multi-goal reaching is an important problem in reinforcement learning needed to achieve algorithmic generalization. Despite recent advances in this field, current algorithms suffer from three major challenges: high sample complexity, learning only a single way of reaching the goals, and difficulties in solving complex motion planning tasks. In order to address these limitations, we introduce the concept of cumulative accessibility functions, which measure the reachability of a goal from a given state within a specified horizon. We show that these functions obey a recurrence relation, which enables learning from offline interactions. We also prove that optimal cumulative accessibility functions are monotonic in the planning horizon. Additionally, our method can trade off speed and reliability in goal-reaching by suggesting multiple paths to a single goal depending on the provided horizon. We evaluate our approach on a set of multi-goal discrete and continuous control tasks. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art goal-reaching algorithms in success rate, sample complexity, and path optimality.

"Deep Neural Network-based systems are now the state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst-case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios and a classic control task. This work extends one of our prior works with new performance guarantees, extensions to other RL algorithms, expanded results aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial behavior, comparisons with a more computationally expensive method, and visualizations that provide intuition about the robustness algorithm.",0
"Although Deep Neural Network-based systems are currently the leading approach for many robotics tasks, their application in safety-critical domains presents serious risks in the absence of formal guarantees on network robustness.

"Actor-critic style two-time-scale algorithms are very popular in reinforcement learning, and have seen great empirical success. However, their performance is not completely understood theoretically. In this paper, we characterize the global convergence of an online natural actor-critic algorithm in the tabular setting using a single trajectory. Our analysis applies to very general settings, as we only assume that the underlying Markov chain is ergodic under all policies (the so-called Recurrence assumption). We employ $\epsilon$-greedy sampling in order to ensure enough exploration.   For a fixed exploration parameter $\epsilon$, we show that the natural actor critic algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon T^{1/4}}+\epsilon)$ close to the global optimum after $T$ iterations of the algorithm.   By carefully diminishing the exploration parameter $\epsilon$ as the iterations proceed, we also show convergence to the global optimum at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/6})$.",0

"Transformers have been successfully applied to sequential, auto-regressive tasks despite being feedforward networks. Unlike recurrent neural networks, Transformers use attention to capture temporal relations while processing input tokens in parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input. The representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already available. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers.",0

"Novel Object Captioning is a zero-shot Image Captioning task requiring describing objects not seen in the training captions, but for which information is available from external object detectors. The key challenge is to select and describe all salient detected novel objects in the input images. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and propose the ECOL-R model (Encouraging Copying of Object Labels with Reinforced Learning), a copy-augmented transformer model that is encouraged to accurately describe the novel object labels. This is achieved via a specialised reward function in the SCST reinforcement learning framework (Rennie et al., 2017) that encourages novel object mentions while maintaining the caption quality. We further restrict the SCST training to the images where detected objects are mentioned in reference captions to train the ECOL-R model. We additionally improve our copy mechanism via Abstract Labels, which transfer knowledge from known to novel object types, and a Morphological Selector, which determines the appropriate inflected forms of novel object labels. The resulting model sets new state-of-the-art on the nocaps (Agrawal et al., 2019) and held-out COCO (Hendricks et al., 2016) benchmarks.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in sequential decision-making problems but suffers from a long training time to obtain such good performance. Many parallel and distributed DRL training approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, but it is difficult to utilize them on resource-limited devices. In order to accelerate DRL in real-world edge devices, memory bandwidth bottlenecks due to large weight transactions have to be resolved. However, previous iterative pruning not only shows a low compression ratio at the beginning of training but also makes DRL training unstable. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel weight compression method for DRL training acceleration, named group-sparse training (GST). GST selectively utilizes block-circulant compression to maintain a high weight compression ratio during all iterations of DRL training and dynamically adapt target sparsity through reward-aware pruning for stable training. Thanks to the features, GST achieves a 25 \%p $\sim$ 41.5 \%p higher average compression ratio than the iterative pruning method without reward drop in Mujoco Halfcheetah-v2 and Mujoco humanoid-v2 environment with TD3 training.",0

"With the decreasing cost of data collection, the space of variables or features that can be used to characterize a particular predictor of interest continues to grow exponentially. Therefore, identifying the most characterizing features that minimizes the variance without jeopardizing the bias of our models is critical to successfully training a machine learning model. In addition, identifying such features is critical for interpretability, prediction accuracy and optimal computation cost. While statistical methods such as subset selection, shrinkage, dimensionality reduction have been applied in selecting the best set of features, some other approaches in literature have approached feature selection task as a search problem where each state in the search space is a possible feature subset. In this paper, we solved the feature selection problem using Reinforcement Learning. Formulating the state space as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we used Temporal Difference (TD) algorithm to select the best subset of features. Each state was evaluated using a robust and low cost classifier algorithm which could handle any non-linearities in the dataset.",0

"We present a novel Neural Embedding Spatio-Temporal (NEST) point process model for spatio-temporal discrete event data and develop an efficient imitation learning (a type of reinforcement learning) based approach for model fitting. Despite the rapid development of one-dimensional temporal point processes for discrete event data, the study of spatial-temporal aspects of such data is relatively scarce. Our model captures complex spatio-temporal dependence between discrete events by carefully design a mixture of heterogeneous Gaussian diffusion kernels, whose parameters are parameterized by neural networks. This new kernel is the key that our model can capture intricate spatial dependence patterns and yet still lead to interpretable results as we examine maps of Gaussian diffusion kernel parameters. The imitation learning model fitting for the NEST is more robust than the maximum likelihood estimate. It directly measures the divergence between the empirical distributions between the training data and the model-generated data. Moreover, our imitation learning-based approach enjoys computational efficiency due to the explicit characterization of the reward function related to the likelihood function; furthermore, the likelihood function under our model enjoys tractable expression due to Gaussian kernel parameterization. Experiments based on real data show our method's good performance relative to the state-of-the-art and the good interpretability of NEST's result.",0

"This paper proposes a \emph{fully asynchronous} scheme for the policy evaluation problem of distributed reinforcement learning (DisRL) over directed peer-to-peer networks. Without waiting for any other node of the network, each node can locally update its value function at any time by using (possibly delayed) information from its neighbors. This is in sharp contrast to the gossip-based scheme where a pair of nodes concurrently update. Though the fully asynchronous setting involves a difficult multi-timescale decision problem, we design a novel stochastic average gradient (SAG) based distributed algorithm and develop a push-pull augmented graph approach to prove its exact convergence at a linear rate of $\mathcal{O}(c^k)$ where $c\in(0,1)$ and $k$ increases by one no matter on which node updates. Finally, numerical experiments validate that our method speeds up linearly with respect to the number of nodes, and is robust to straggler nodes.",0

"In safety-critical applications, autonomous agents may need to learn in an environment where mistakes can be very costly. In such settings, the agent needs to behave safely not only after but also while learning. To achieve this, existing safe reinforcement learning methods make an agent rely on priors that let it avoid dangerous situations during exploration with high probability, but both the probabilistic guarantees and the smoothness assumptions inherent in the priors are not viable in many scenarios of interest such as autonomous driving. This paper presents an alternative approach inspired by human teaching, where an agent learns under the supervision of an automatic instructor that saves the agent from violating constraints during learning. In this model, we introduce the monitor that neither needs to know how to do well at the task the agent is learning nor needs to know how the environment works. Instead, it has a library of reset controllers that it activates when the agent starts behaving dangerously, preventing it from doing damage. Crucially, the choices of which reset controller to apply in which situation affect the speed of agent learning. Based on observing agents' progress, the teacher itself learns a policy for choosing the reset controllers, a curriculum, to optimize the agent's final policy reward. Our experiments use this framework in two environments to induce curricula for safe and efficient learning.",0

"We study the robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) with adversarially perturbed state observations, which aligns with the setting of many adversarial attacks to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and is also important for rolling out real-world RL agent under unpredictable sensing noise. With a fixed agent policy, we demonstrate that an optimal adversary to perturb state observations can be found, which is guaranteed to obtain the worst case agent reward. For DRL settings, this leads to a novel empirical adversarial attack to RL agents via a learned adversary that is much stronger than previous ones. To enhance the robustness of an agent, we propose a framework of alternating training with learned adversaries (ATLA), which trains an adversary online together with the agent using policy gradient following the optimal adversarial attack framework. Additionally, inspired by the analysis of state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), we show that past states and actions (history) can be useful for learning a robust agent, and we empirically find a LSTM based policy can be more robust under adversaries. Empirical evaluations on a few continuous control environments show that ATLA achieves state-of-the-art performance under strong adversaries.

Through our work, we demonstrate that an optimal adversary can be identified for perturbing state observations, which guarantees the worst case agent reward with a fixed policy. This enables a novel empirical adversarial attack on RL agents in DRL settings, which outperforms previous methods. To improve agent robustness, we propose a new framework called alternating training with learned adversaries (ATLA), which trains an adversary alongside the agent using policy gradient following the optimal adversarial attack framework.

"A common vision from science fiction is that robots will one day inhabit our physical spaces, sense the world as we do, assist our physical labours, and communicate with us through natural language. Here we study how to design artificial agents that can interact naturally with humans using the simplification of a virtual environment. This setting nevertheless integrates a number of the central challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) research: complex visual perception and goal-directed physical control, grounded language comprehension and production, and multi-agent social interaction. To build agents that can robustly interact with humans, we would ideally train them while they interact with humans. However, this is presently impractical. Therefore, we approximate the role of the human with another learned agent, and use ideas from inverse reinforcement learning to reduce the disparities between human-human and agent-agent interactive behaviour. Rigorously evaluating our agents poses a great challenge, so we develop a variety of behavioural tests, including evaluation by humans who watch videos of agents or interact directly with them. These evaluations convincingly demonstrate that interactive training and auxiliary losses improve agent behaviour beyond what is achieved by supervised learning of actions alone. Further, we demonstrate that agent capabilities generalise beyond literal experiences in the dataset. Finally, we train evaluation models whose ratings of agents agree well with human judgement, thus permitting the evaluation of new agent models without additional effort. Taken together, our results in this virtual environment provide evidence that large-scale human behavioural imitation is a promising tool to create intelligent, interactive agents, and the challenge of reliably evaluating such agents is possible to surmount.",0
"Many science fiction stories depict a future where robots coexist with humans, possessing the ability to sense and understand the world around them, assist in physical tasks, and communicate using natural language. This study focuses on designing artificial agents that can interact with humans naturally within a virtual environment, which presents challenges in areas such as visual perception, physical control, language processing, and social interaction. Although the ideal training for these agents would involve actual human interaction, it is currently not feasible, so the study employs another learned agent to approximate human behavior through inverse reinforcement learning. The study also develops various behavioral tests to evaluate the agents, including human observation and interaction. The results show that interactive training and auxiliary losses improve agent behavior beyond supervised learning, and that the agents' capabilities extend beyond the dataset. Additionally, evaluation models are trained to rate the agents, which agree with human judgement, making it easier to evaluate new agent models. Overall, the study suggests that large-scale human imitation can effectively create intelligent and interactive agents, and that evaluating these agents can be achieved reliably.",1
"This paper introduces MDP homomorphic networks for deep reinforcement learning. MDP homomorphic networks are neural networks that are equivariant under symmetries in the joint state-action space of an MDP. Current approaches to deep reinforcement learning do not usually exploit knowledge about such structure. By building this prior knowledge into policy and value networks using an equivariance constraint, we can reduce the size of the solution space. We specifically focus on group-structured symmetries (invertible transformations). Additionally, we introduce an easy method for constructing equivariant network layers numerically, so the system designer need not solve the constraints by hand, as is typically done. We construct MDP homomorphic MLPs and CNNs that are equivariant under either a group of reflections or rotations. We show that such networks converge faster than unstructured baselines on CartPole, a grid world and Pong.",0

"In this paper, we propose Broad Neural Architecture Search (BNAS) where we elaborately design broad scalable architecture dubbed Broad Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) to solve the above issue. On one hand, the proposed broad scalable architecture has fast training speed due to its shallow topology. Moreover, we also adopt reinforcement learning and parameter sharing used in ENAS as the optimization strategy of BNAS. Hence, the proposed approach can achieve higher search efficiency. On the other hand, the broad scalable architecture extracts multi-scale features and enhancement representations, and feeds them into global average pooling layer to yield more reasonable and comprehensive representations. Therefore, the performance of broad scalable architecture can be promised. In particular, we also develop two variants for BNAS who modify the topology of BCNN. In order to verify the effectiveness of BNAS, several experiments are performed and experimental results show that 1) BNAS delivers 0.19 days which is 2.37x less expensive than ENAS who ranks the best in reinforcement learning-based NAS approaches, 2) compared with small-size (0.5 millions parameters) and medium-size (1.1 millions parameters) models, the architecture learned by BNAS obtains state-of-the-art performance (3.58% and 3.24% test error) on CIFAR-10, 3) the learned architecture achieves 25.3% top-1 error on ImageNet just using 3.9 millions parameters.",0

"One of the biggest challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning is coordination, a typical application scenario of this is traffic signal control. Recently, it has attracted a rising number of researchers and has become a hot research field with great practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called MetaVRS~(Meta Variational RewardShaping) for traffic signal coordination control. By heuristically applying the intrinsic reward to the environmental reward, MetaVRS can wisely capture the agent-to-agent interplay. Besides, latent variables generated by VAE are brought into policy for automatically tradeoff between exploration and exploitation to optimize the policy. In addition, meta learning was used in decoder for faster adaptation and better approximation. Empirically, we demonstate that MetaVRS substantially outperforms existing methods and shows superior adaptability, which predictably has a far-reaching significance to the multi-agent traffic signal coordination control.",0

"We study the problem of programmatic reinforcement learning, in which policies are represented as short programs in a symbolic language. Programmatic policies can be more interpretable, generalizable, and amenable to formal verification than neural policies; however, designing rigorous learning approaches for such policies remains a challenge. Our approach to this challenge -- a meta-algorithm called PROPEL -- is based on three insights. First, we view our learning task as optimization in policy space, modulo the constraint that the desired policy has a programmatic representation, and solve this optimization problem using a form of mirror descent that takes a gradient step into the unconstrained policy space and then projects back onto the constrained space. Second, we view the unconstrained policy space as mixing neural and programmatic representations, which enables employing state-of-the-art deep policy gradient approaches. Third, we cast the projection step as program synthesis via imitation learning, and exploit contemporary combinatorial methods for this task. We present theoretical convergence results for PROPEL and empirically evaluate the approach in three continuous control domains. The experiments show that PROPEL can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches for learning programmatic policies.",0

While neural policies have their advantages, programmatic policies are more easily understood, applicable to a wider range of scenarios, and can be verified with greater accuracy.

Firstly, we consider our learning task as an optimization problem in policy space, with the condition that the desired policy must have a programmatic representation. We solve this problem using a type of mirror descent that takes a gradient step into the unconstrained policy space before projecting back into the restricted space. Secondly, we view the unconstrained policy space as a combination of neural and programmatic representations, allowing us to use cutting-edge deep policy gradient techniques. Finally, we treat the projection step as program synthesis via imitation learning, utilizing up-to-date combinatorial methods.

Concretely, we present a meta-learning method for learning parametric loss functions that can generalize across different tasks and model architectures. We develop a pipeline for meta-training such loss functions, targeted at maximizing the performance of the model trained under them. The loss landscape produced by our learned losses significantly improves upon the original task-specific losses in both supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. Furthermore, we show that our meta-learning framework is flexible enough to incorporate additional information at meta-train time.

"Though deep reinforcement learning has led to breakthroughs in many difficult domains, these successes have required an ever-increasing number of samples. As state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) systems require an exponentially increasing number of samples, their development is restricted to a continually shrinking segment of the AI community. Likewise, many of these systems cannot be applied to real-world problems, where environment samples are expensive. Resolution of these limitations requires new, sample-efficient methods. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce the MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Human Priors.   The primary goal of the competition is to foster the development of algorithms which can efficiently leverage human demonstrations to drastically reduce the number of samples needed to solve complex, hierarchical, and sparse environments. To that end, we introduce: (1) the Minecraft ObtainDiamond task, a sequential decision making environment requiring long-term planning, hierarchical control, and efficient exploration methods; and (2) the MineRL-v0 dataset, a large-scale collection of over 60 million state-action pairs of human demonstrations that can be resimulated into embodied trajectories with arbitrary modifications to game state and visuals.   Participants will compete to develop systems which solve the ObtainDiamond task with a limited number of samples from the environment simulator, Malmo. The competition is structured into two rounds in which competitors are provided several paired versions of the dataset and environment with different game textures. At the end of each round, competitors will submit containerized versions of their learning algorithms and they will then be trained/evaluated from scratch on a hold-out dataset-environment pair for a total of 4-days on a prespecified hardware platform.",0

"In the industrial interior design process, professional designers plan the size and position of furniture in a room to achieve a satisfactory design for selling.

"Reinforcement learning in complex environments is a challenging problem. In particular, the success of reinforcement learning algorithms depends on a well-designed reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) solves the problem of recovering reward functions from expert demonstrations. In this paper, we solve a hierarchical inverse reinforcement learning problem within the options framework, which allows us to utilize intrinsic motivation of the expert demonstrations. A gradient method for parametrized options is used to deduce a defining equation for the Q-feature space, which leads to a reward feature space. Using a second-order optimality condition for option parameters, an optimal reward function is selected.

"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, however, the computational demands of reinforcement learning training and inference remain substantial. Quantization is an effective method to reduce the computational overheads of neural networks, though in the context of reinforcement learning, it is unknown whether quantization's computational benefits outweigh the accuracy costs introduced by the corresponding quantization error. To quantify this tradeoff we perform a broad study applying quantization to reinforcement learning. We apply standard quantization techniques such as post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization aware training (QAT) to a comprehensive set of reinforcement learning tasks (Atari, Gym), algorithms (A2C, DDPG, DQN, D4PG, PPO), and models (MLPs, CNNs) and show that policies may be quantized to 8-bits without degrading reward, enabling significant inference speedups on resource-constrained edge devices. Motivated by the effectiveness of standard quantization techniques on reinforcement learning policies, we introduce a novel quantization algorithm, \textit{ActorQ}, for quantized actor-learner distributed reinforcement learning training. By leveraging full precision optimization on the learner and quantized execution on the actors, \textit{ActorQ} enables 8-bit inference while maintaining convergence. We develop a system for quantized reinforcement learning training around \textit{ActorQ} and demonstrate end to end speedups of $>$ 1.5 $\times$ - 2.5 $\times$ over full precision training on a range of tasks (Deepmind Control Suite). Finally, we break down the various runtime costs of distributed reinforcement learning training (such as communication time, inference time, model load time, etc) and evaluate the effects of quantization on these system attributes.",0

"Exploration is one of the core challenges in reinforcement learning. A common formulation of curiosity-driven exploration uses the difference between the real future and the future predicted by a learned model.

In this paper, we introduce an alternative form of curiosity that rewards novel associations between different senses. Our approach exploits multiple modalities to provide a stronger signal for more efficient exploration. Our method is inspired by the fact that, for humans, both sight and sound play a critical role in exploration.

"Policy specification is a process by which a human can initialize a robot's behaviour and, in turn, warm-start policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). While policy specification/design is inherently a collaborative process, modern methods based on Learning from Demonstration or Deep RL lack the model interpretability and accessibility to be classified as such. Current state-of-the-art methods for policy specification rely on black-box models, which are an insufficient means of collaboration for non-expert users: These models provide no means of inspecting policies learnt by the agent and are not focused on creating a usable modality for teaching robot behaviour. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning framework that enables humans to 1) specify, through natural language, interpretable policies in the form of easy-to-understand decision trees, 2) leverage these policies to warm-start reinforcement learning and 3) outperform baselines that lack our natural language initialization mechanism. We train our approach by collecting a first-of-its-kind corpus mapping free-form natural language policy descriptions to decision tree-based policies. We show that our novel framework translates natural language to decision trees with a 96% and 97% accuracy on a held-out corpus across two domains, respectively. Finally, we validate that policies initialized with natural language commands are able to significantly outperform relevant baselines (p < 0.001) that do not benefit from our natural language-based warm-start technique.",0

"In reinforcement learning, temporal difference-based algorithms can be sample-inefficient: for instance, with sparse rewards, no learning occurs until a reward is observed. This can be remedied by learning richer objects, such as a model of the environment, or successor states. Successor states model the expected future state occupancy from any given state for a given policy and are related to goal-dependent value functions, which learn how to reach arbitrary states. We formally derive the temporal difference algorithm for successor state and goal-dependent value function learning, either for discrete or for continuous environments with function approximation. Especially, we provide finite-variance estimators even in continuous environments, where the reward for exactly reaching a goal state becomes infinitely sparse. Successor states satisfy more than just the Bellman equation: a backward Bellman operator and a Bellman-Newton (BN) operator encode path compositionality in the environment. The BN operator is akin to second-order gradient descent methods and provides the true update of the value function when acquiring more observations, with explicit tabular bounds. In the tabular case and with infinitesimal learning rates, mixing the usual and backward Bellman operators provably improves eigenvalues for asymptotic convergence, and the asymptotic convergence of the BN operator is provably better than TD, with a rate independent from the environment. However, the BN method is more complex and less robust to sampling noise. Finally, a forward-backward (FB) finite-rank parameterization of successor states enjoys reduced variance and improved samplability, provides a direct model of the value function, has fully understood fixed points corresponding to long-range dependencies, approximates the BN method, and provides two canonical representations of states as a byproduct.",0

"Entropic regularization of policies in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a commonly used heuristic to ensure that the learned policy explores the state-space sufficiently before overfitting to a local optimal policy. The primary motivation for using entropy is for exploration and disambiguating optimal policies; however, the theoretical effects are not entirely understood. In this work, we study the more general regularized RL objective and using Fenchel duality; we derive the dual problem which takes the form of an adversarial reward problem. In particular, we find that the optimal policy found by a regularized objective is precisely an optimal policy of a reinforcement learning problem under a worst-case adversarial reward. Our result allows us to reinterpret the popular entropic regularization scheme as a form of robustification. Furthermore, due to the generality of our results, we apply to other existing regularization schemes. Our results thus give insights into the effects of regularization of policies and deepen our understanding of exploration through robust rewards at large.",0

"In recent years, a variety of tasks have been accomplished by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, when applying DRL to tasks in a real-world environment, designing an appropriate reward is difficult. Rewards obtained via actual hardware sensors may include noise, misinterpretation, or failed observations. The learning instability caused by these unstable signals is a problem that remains to be solved in DRL. In this work, we propose an approach that extends existing DRL models by adding a subtask to directly estimate the variance contained in the reward signal. The model then takes the feature map learned by the subtask in a critic network and sends it to the actor network. This enables stable learning that is robust to the effects of potential noise. The results of experiments in the Atari game domain with unstable reward signals show that our method stabilizes training convergence. We also discuss the extensibility of the model by visualizing feature maps. This approach has the potential to make DRL more practical for use in noisy, real-world scenarios.",0

"Training a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is more challenging than training a single-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, because the result of a multi-agent task strongly depends on the complex interactions among agents and their interactions with a stochastic and dynamic environment. We propose an algorithm that boosts MARL training using the biased action information of other agents based on a friend-or-foe concept. For a cooperative and competitive environment, there are generally two groups of agents: cooperative-agents and competitive-agents. In the proposed algorithm, each agent updates its value function using its own action and the biased action information of other agents in the two groups. The biased joint action of cooperative agents is computed as the sum of their actual joint action and the imaginary cooperative joint action, by assuming all the cooperative agents jointly maximize the target agent's value function. The biased joint action of competitive agents can be computed similarly. Each agent then updates its own value function using the biased action information, resulting in a biased value function and corresponding biased policy. Subsequently, the biased policy of each agent is inevitably subjected to recommend an action to cooperate and compete with other agents, thereby introducing more active interactions among agents and enhancing the MARL policy learning. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in various mixed cooperative-competitive environments. Furthermore, the introduced biases gradually decrease as the training proceeds and the correction based on the imaginary assumption vanishes.",0
"Teaching a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is a more difficult task compared to teaching a single-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. This is because the outcome of a multi-agent task relies heavily on intricate interactions among agents and how they interact with a dynamic and stochastic environment. We have developed an algorithm that enhances MARL training by using the partiality of other agents' actions based on a ""friend-or-foe"" concept. In a cooperative and competitive environment, there are two main groups of agents: cooperative-agents and competitive-agents. In our algorithm, each agent updates its value function using its own action and the partial action information of other agents in the two groups. The partial joint action of cooperative agents is calculated by adding their actual joint action and the hypothetical cooperative joint action, assuming that all cooperative agents are jointly maximizing the target agent's value function. The partial joint action of competitive agents can be computed similarly. Each agent then updates its own value function using the partial action information, leading to a partial value function and corresponding biased policy. Consequently, each agent's biased policy recommends actions to cooperate and compete with other agents, thereby increasing active interactions among agents and enhancing the MARL policy learning. We have demonstrated that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in various mixed cooperative-competitive environments. Moreover, the introduced biases gradually decrease as the training progresses, and the correction based on the hypothetical assumption disappears.",1
"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has demonstrated significant success in training decentralised policies in a centralised manner by making use of value factorization methods. However, addressing surprise across spurious states and approximation bias remain open problems for multi-agent settings. Towards this goal, we introduce the Energy-based MIXer (EMIX), an algorithm which minimizes surprise utilizing the energy across agents. Our contributions are threefold; (1) EMIX introduces a novel surprise minimization technique across multiple agents in the case of multi-agent partially-observable settings. (2) EMIX highlights a practical use of energy functions in MARL with theoretical guarantees and experiment validations of the energy operator. Lastly, (3) EMIX extends Maxmin Q-learning for addressing overestimation bias across agents in MARL. In a study of challenging StarCraft II micromanagement scenarios, EMIX demonstrates consistent stable performance for multiagent surprise minimization. Moreover, our ablation study highlights the necessity of the energy-based scheme and the need for elimination of overestimation bias in MARL.

"A hallmark of an AI agent is to mimic human beings to understand and interact with others. In this paper, we propose a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a \emph{joint} policy through the interactions over agents. To make a joint decision over the group, each agent makes an initial decision and tells its policy to its neighbors. Then each agent modifies its own policy properly based on received messages and spreads out its plan. As this intention propagation procedure goes on, we prove that it converges to a mean-field approximation of the joint policy with the framework of neural embedded probabilistic inference. We evaluate our algorithm on several large scale challenging tasks and demonstrate that it outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to their observations, similar to adversarial examples for classifiers. However, an attacker is not usually able to directly modify another agent's observations. This might lead one to wonder: is it possible to attack an RL agent simply by choosing an adversarial policy acting in a multi-agent environment so as to create natural observations that are adversarial? We demonstrate the existence of adversarial policies in zero-sum games between simulated humanoid robots with proprioceptive observations, against state-of-the-art victims trained via self-play to be robust to opponents. The adversarial policies reliably win against the victims but generate seemingly random and uncoordinated behavior. We find that these policies are more successful in high-dimensional environments, and induce substantially different activations in the victim policy network than when the victim plays against a normal opponent.

"Advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) have demonstrated data efficiency and optimal control over large state spaces at the cost of scalable performance. Genetic methods, on the other hand, provide scalability but depict hyperparameter sensitivity towards evolutionary operations. However, a combination of the two methods has recently demonstrated success in scaling RL agents to high-dimensional action spaces. Parallel to recent developments, we present the Evolution-based Soft Actor-Critic (ESAC), a scalable RL algorithm. We abstract exploration from exploitation by combining Evolution Strategies (ES) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). Through this lens, we enable dominant skill transfer between offsprings by making use of soft winner selections and genetic crossovers in hindsight and simultaneously improve hyperparameter sensitivity in evolutions using the novel Automatic Mutation Tuning (AMT). AMT gradually replaces the entropy framework of SAC allowing the population to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible, without making use of backpropagation updates. In a study of challenging locomotion tasks consisting of high-dimensional action spaces and sparse rewards, ESAC demonstrates improved performance and sample efficiency in comparison to the Maximum Entropy framework. Additionally, ESAC presents efficacious use of hardware resources and algorithm overhead. A complete implementation of ESAC can be found at karush17.github.io/esac-web/.",0

"The performance of deep (reinforcement) learning systems crucially depends on the choice of hyperparameters. Their tuning is notoriously expensive, typically requiring an iterative training process to run for numerous steps to convergence. Traditional tuning algorithms only consider the final performance of hyperparameters acquired after many expensive iterations and ignore intermediate information from earlier training steps. In this paper, we present a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach which exploits the iterative structure of learning algorithms for efficient hyperparameter tuning. We propose to learn an evaluation function compressing learning progress at any stage of the training process into a single numeric score according to both training success and stability. Our BO framework is then balancing the benefit of assessing a hyperparameter setting over additional training steps against their computation cost. We further increase model efficiency by selectively including scores from different training steps for any evaluated hyperparameter set. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by tuning hyperparameters for the training of deep reinforcement learning agents and convolutional neural networks. Our algorithm outperforms all existing baselines in identifying optimal hyperparameters in minimal time.",0

"In recent years, deep learning methods bring incredible progress to the field of object detection. However, in the field of remote sensing image processing, existing methods neglect the relationship between imaging configuration and detection performance, and do not take into account the importance of detection performance feedback for improving image quality. Therefore, detection performance is limited by the passive nature of the conventional object detection framework. In order to solve the above limitations, this paper takes adaptive brightness adjustment and scale adjustment as examples, and proposes an active object detection method based on deep reinforcement learning. The goal of adaptive image attribute learning is to maximize the detection performance. With the help of active object detection and image attribute adjustment strategies, low-quality images can be converted into high-quality images, and the overall performance is improved without retraining the detector.",0

"In a sequential decision-making problem, off-policy evaluation estimates the expected cumulative reward of a target policy using logged trajectory data generated from a different behavior policy, without execution of the target policy. Reinforcement learning in high-stake environments, such as healthcare and education, is often limited to off-policy settings due to safety or ethical concerns, or inability of exploration. Hence it is imperative to quantify the uncertainty of the off-policy estimate before deployment of the target policy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that provides robust and optimistic cumulative reward estimates using one or multiple logged trajectories data. Leveraging methodologies from distributionally robust optimization, we show that with proper selection of the size of the distributional uncertainty set, these estimates serve as confidence bounds with non-asymptotic and asymptotic guarantees under stochastic or adversarial environments. Our results are also generalized to batch reinforcement learning and are supported by empirical analysis.",0

"Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) optimization is an efficient method for adjusting the vertical tilt angle of Base Stations (BSs) antennas in order to optimize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the network. Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for RET optimization because of its self-learning capabilities and adaptivity to environmental changes. However, an RL agent may execute unsafe actions during the course of its interaction, i.e., actions resulting in undesired network performance degradation. Since the reliability of services is critical for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), the prospect of performance degradation has prohibited the real-world deployment of RL methods for RET optimization. In this work, we model the RET optimization problem in the Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) framework with the goal of learning a tilt control strategy providing performance improvement guarantees with respect to a safe baseline. We leverage a recent SRL method, namely Safe Policy Improvement through Baseline Bootstrapping (SPIBB), to learn an improved policy from an offline dataset of interactions collected by the safe baseline. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is able to learn a safe and improved tilt update policy, providing a higher degree of reliability and potential for real-world network deployment.",0

"Traditional autonomous vehicle pipelines that follow a modular approach have been very successful in the past both in academia and industry, which has led to autonomy deployed on road.

Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been shown to learn complex strategic games and perform challenging robotic tasks, which provides an appealing framework for learning to drive. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to learn optimal control policy using waypoints and low-dimensional visual representations, also known as affordances. We demonstrate that our agents when trained from scratch learn the tasks of lane-following, driving around inter-sections as well as stopping in front of other actors or traffic lights even in the dense traffic setting.

"Several AutoML approaches have been proposed to automate the machine learning (ML) process, such as searching for the ML model architectures and hyper-parameters.

In this paper, we propose the first robust AutoML framework, Robusta--based on reinforcement learning (RL)--to perform feature selection, aiming to select features that lead to both accurate and robust ML systems. We show that a variation of the 0-1 robust loss can be directly optimized via an RL-based combinatorial search in the feature selection scenario. In addition, we employ heuristics to accelerate the search procedure based on feature scoring metrics, which are mutual information scores, tree-based classifiers feature importance scores, F scores, and Integrated Gradient (IG) scores, as well as their combinations.

"In order for agents trained by deep reinforcement learning to work alongside humans in realistic settings, we will need to ensure that the agents are \emph{robust}. Since the real world is very diverse, and human behavior often changes in response to agent deployment, the agent will likely encounter novel situations that have never been seen during training. This results in an evaluation challenge: if we cannot rely on the average training or validation reward as a metric, then how can we effectively evaluate robustness? We take inspiration from the practice of \emph{unit testing} in software engineering. Specifically, we suggest that when designing AI agents that collaborate with humans, designers should search for potential edge cases in \emph{possible partner behavior} and \emph{possible states encountered}, and write tests which check that the behavior of the agent in these edge cases is reasonable. We apply this methodology to build a suite of unit tests for the Overcooked-AI environment, and use this test suite to evaluate three proposals for improving robustness. We find that the test suite provides significant insight into the effects of these proposals that were generally not revealed by looking solely at the average validation reward.",0

To address this, we propose taking a cue from software engineering's unit testing practice. In designing AI agents that collaborate with humans, designers should identify potential edge cases in possible partner behavior and states encountered, and write tests to verify the agent's behavior in these cases. We apply this approach to Overcooked-AI and discover that our test suite provides valuable insight into the effects of proposed robustness improvements, which were not evident by solely examining average validation reward metrics.",1
"A major challenge in reinforcement learning is exploration, when local dithering methods such as epsilon-greedy sampling are insufficient to solve a given task. Many recent methods have proposed to intrinsically motivate an agent to seek novel states, driving the agent to discover improved reward. However, while state-novelty exploration methods are suitable for tasks where novel observations correlate well with improved reward, they may not explore more efficiently than epsilon-greedy approaches in environments where the two are not well-correlated. In this paper, we distinguish between exploration tasks in which seeking novel states aids in finding new reward, and those where it does not, such as goal-conditioned tasks and escaping local reward maxima. We propose a new exploration objective, maximizing the reward prediction error (RPE) of a value function trained to predict extrinsic reward. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning method, QXplore, which exploits the temporal difference error of a Q-function to solve hard exploration tasks in high-dimensional MDPs. We demonstrate the exploration behavior of QXplore on several OpenAI Gym MuJoCo tasks and Atari games and observe that QXplore is comparable to or better than a baseline state-novelty method in all cases, outperforming the baseline on tasks where state novelty is not well-correlated with improved reward.",0

Our tracking model was trained in a supervised fashion on datasets we will also release, and our Evaluation Model relies only on simulations of virtual soccer games. Combining those two architectures allows one to evaluate Soccer Players directly from a live camera without large datasets constraints.

"As power systems are undergoing a significant transformation with more uncertainties, less inertia and closer to operation limits, there is increasing risk of large outages. Thus, there is an imperative need to enhance grid emergency control to maintain system reliability and security. Towards this end, great progress has been made in developing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based grid control solutions in recent years. However, existing DRL-based solutions have two main limitations: 1) they cannot handle well with a wide range of grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies; 2) they generally lack the ability to fast adapt to new grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies, limiting their applicability for real-world applications. In this paper, we mitigate these limitations by developing a novel deep meta reinforcement learning (DMRL) algorithm. The DMRL combines the meta strategy optimization together with DRL, and trains policies modulated by a latent space that can quickly adapt to new scenarios. We test the developed DMRL algorithm on the IEEE 300-bus system.

"Off-policy reinforcement learning holds the promise of sample-efficient learning of decision-making policies by leveraging past experience. However, in the offline RL setting -- where a fixed collection of interactions are provided and no further interactions are allowed -- it has been shown that standard off-policy RL methods can significantly underperform. Recently proposed methods often aim to address this shortcoming by constraining learned policies to remain close to the given dataset of interactions. In this work, we closely investigate an important simplification of BCQ -- a prior approach for offline RL -- which removes a heuristic design choice and naturally restricts extracted policies to remain exactly within the support of a given behavior policy. Importantly, in contrast to their original theoretical considerations, we derive this simplified algorithm through the introduction of a novel backup operator, Expected-Max Q-Learning (EMaQ), which is more closely related to the resulting practical algorithm. Specifically, in addition to the distribution support, EMaQ explicitly considers the number of samples and the proposal distribution, allowing us to derive new sub-optimality bounds which can serve as a novel measure of complexity for offline RL problems. In the offline RL setting -- the main focus of this work -- EMaQ matches and outperforms prior state-of-the-art in the D4RL benchmarks. In the online RL setting, we demonstrate that EMaQ is competitive with Soft Actor Critic. The key contributions of our empirical findings are demonstrating the importance of careful generative model design for estimating behavior policies, and an intuitive notion of complexity for offline RL problems. With its simple interpretation and fewer moving parts, such as no explicit function approximator representing the policy, EMaQ serves as a strong yet easy to implement baseline for future work.",0

"This paper proves that the episodic learning environment of every finite-horizon decision task has a unique steady state under any behavior policy, and that the marginal distribution of the agent's input indeed converges to the steady-state distribution in essentially all episodic learning processes. This observation supports an interestingly reversed mindset against conventional wisdom: While the existence of unique steady states was often presumed in continual learning but considered less relevant in episodic learning, it turns out their existence is guaranteed for the latter. Based on this insight, the paper unifies episodic and continual RL around several important concepts that have been separately treated in these two RL formalisms. Practically, the existence of unique and approachable steady state enables a general way to collect data in episodic RL tasks, which the paper applies to policy gradient algorithms as a demonstration, based on a new steady-state policy gradient theorem. Finally, the paper also proposes and experimentally validates a perturbation method that facilitates rapid steady-state convergence in real-world RL tasks.",0
"In this paper, it is demonstrated that every finite-horizon decision task's episodic learning environment has a distinct steady state that is guaranteed under any behavior policy. Moreover, it is observed that the agent's input's marginal distribution converges to the steady-state distribution in almost all episodic learning processes. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that unique steady states are more relevant in continual learning than in episodic learning. Consequently, the paper unifies episodic and continual RL by integrating various crucial concepts that have been separately dealt with in these two RL formalisms. The paper also presents a general approach to collect data in episodic RL tasks, which is enabled by the existence of the unique and accessible steady state. The proposed method is demonstrated using policy gradient algorithms based on a new steady-state policy gradient theorem. Additionally, the paper suggests and validates a perturbation technique that accelerates steady-state convergence in practical RL tasks.",1
"The study of exploration in the domain of decision making has a long history but remains actively debated. From the vast literature that addressed this topic for decades under various points of view (e.g., developmental psychology, experimental design, artificial intelligence), intrinsic motivation emerged as a concept that can practically be transferred to artificial agents. Especially, in the recent field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents implement such a concept (mainly using a novelty argument) in the shape of an exploration bonus, added to the task reward, that encourages visiting the whole environment. This approach is supported by the large amount of theory on RL for which convergence to optimality assumes exhaustive exploration. Yet, Human Beings and mammals do not exhaustively explore the world and their motivation is not only based on novelty but also on various other factors (e.g., curiosity, fun, style, pleasure, safety, competition, etc.). They optimize for life-long learning and train to learn transferable skills in playgrounds without obvious goals. They also apply innate or learned priors to save time and stay safe. For these reasons, we propose to learn an exploration bonus from demonstrations that could transfer these motivations to an artificial agent with little assumptions about their rationale. Using an inverse RL approach, we show that complex exploration behaviors, reflecting different motivations, can be learnt and efficiently used by RL agents to solve tasks for which exhaustive exploration is prohibitive.",0

"Background and motivation: Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is a rapidly developing field. Historically most application has been made to games (such as chess, Atari games, and go). Deep RL is now reaching the stage where it may offer value in real world problems, including optimisation of healthcare systems. One such problem is where to locate ambulances between calls in order to minimise time from emergency call to ambulance on-scene. This is known as the Ambulance Location problem.   Aim: To develop an OpenAI Gym-compatible framework and simulation environment for testing Deep RL agents.   Methods: A custom ambulance dispatch simulation environment was developed using OpenAI Gym and SimPy. Deep RL agents were built using PyTorch. The environment is a simplification of the real world, but allows control over the number of clusters of incident locations, number of possible dispatch locations, number of hospitals, and creating incidents that occur at different locations throughout each day.   Results: A range of Deep RL agents based on Deep Q networks were tested in this custom environment. All reduced time to respond to emergency calls compared with random allocation to dispatch points. Bagging Noisy Duelling Deep Q networks gave the most consistence performance. All methods had a tendency to lose performance if trained for too long, and so agents were saved at their optimal performance (and tested on independent simulation runs).   Conclusions: Deep RL agents, developed using simulated environments, have the potential to offer a novel approach to optimise the Ambulance Location problem. Creating open simulation environments should allow more rapid progress in this field.",0
"The area of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) has experienced rapid growth, with most applications initially being applied to games like chess, Atari games, and go. However, Deep RL has now advanced to the point where it can be useful in addressing real-world issues, such as the optimization of healthcare systems. One such problem that can benefit from this technology is the Ambulance Location problem, which involves determining the optimal placement of ambulances between calls to minimize response time. The goal of this study was to develop a simulation environment compatible with OpenAI Gym to test Deep RL agents. The research utilized a custom ambulance dispatch simulation environment created using OpenAI Gym and SimPy, which allowed for control over various parameters, including the number of clusters of incident locations, the number of possible dispatch locations, and the number of hospitals. The study tested a range of Deep RL agents based on Deep Q networks in the custom environment, with all agents demonstrating a reduction in emergency response times compared to random allocation to dispatch points. The most consistent performance was achieved using Bagging Noisy Duelling Deep Q networks. However, it was found that all methods tended to lose performance if trained for too long, and agents were saved at their optimal performance level. The study concludes that simulated environments can help to advance the use of Deep RL agents in addressing the Ambulance Location problem and that open simulation environments can accelerate progress in this field.",1
"This paper introduces Fast Linearized Adaptive Policy (FLAP), a new meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method that is able to extrapolate well to out-of-distribution tasks without the need to reuse data from training, and adapt almost instantaneously with the need of only a few samples during testing. FLAP builds upon the idea of learning a shared linear representation of the policy so that when adapting to a new task, it suffices to predict a set of linear weights. A separate adapter network is trained simultaneously with the policy such that during adaptation, we can directly use the adapter network to predict these linear weights instead of updating a meta-policy via gradient descent, such as in prior meta-RL methods like MAML, to obtain the new policy. The application of the separate feed-forward network not only speeds up the adaptation run-time significantly, but also generalizes extremely well to very different tasks that prior Meta-RL methods fail to generalize to. Experiments on standard continuous-control meta-RL benchmarks show FLAP presenting significantly stronger performance on out-of-distribution tasks with up to double the average return and up to 8X faster adaptation run-time speeds when compared to prior methods.",0

"End-to-end delay is a critical attribute of quality of service (QoS) in application domains such as cloud computing and computer networks. This metric is particularly important in tandem service systems, where the end-to-end service is provided through a chain of services. Service-rate control is a common mechanism for providing QoS guarantees in service systems. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) service-rate controller that provides probabilistic upper-bounds on the end-to-end delay of the system, while preventing the overuse of service resources. In order to have a general framework, we use queueing theory to model the service systems. However, we adopt an RL-based approach to avoid the limitations of queueing-theoretic methods. In particular, we use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to learn the service rates (action) as a function of the queue lengths (state) in tandem service systems. In contrast to existing RL-based methods that quantify their performance by the achieved overall reward, which could be hard to interpret or even misleading, our proposed controller provides explicit probabilistic guarantees on the end-to-end delay of the system. The evaluations are presented for a tandem queueing system with non-exponential inter-arrival and service times, the results of which validate our controller's capability in meeting QoS constraints.",0

"The study and benchmarking of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models has become a trend in many industries, including aerospace engineering and communications. Recent studies in these fields propose these kinds of models to address certain complex real-time decision-making problems in which classic approaches do not meet time requirements or fail to obtain optimal solutions. While the good performance of DRL models has been proved for specific use cases or scenarios, most studies do not discuss the compromises and generalizability of such models during real operations. In this paper we explore the tradeoffs of different elements of DRL models and how they might impact the final performance. To that end, we choose the Frequency Plan Design (FPD) problem in the context of multibeam satellite constellations as our use case and propose a DRL model to address it. We identify 6 different core elements that have a major effect in its performance: the policy, the policy optimizer, the state, action, and reward representations, and the training environment. We analyze different alternatives for each of these elements and characterize their effect. We also use multiple environments to account for different scenarios in which we vary the dimensionality or make the environment nonstationary. Our findings show that DRL is a potential method to address the FPD problem in real operations, especially because of its speed in decision-making. However, no single DRL model is able to outperform the rest in all scenarios, and the best approach for each of the 6 core elements depends on the features of the operation environment. While we agree on the potential of DRL to solve future complex problems in the aerospace industry, we also reflect on the importance of designing appropriate models and training procedures, understanding the applicability of such models, and reporting the main performance tradeoffs.",0

"This paper develops a Pontryagin Differentiable Programming (PDP) methodology, which establishes a unified framework to solve a broad class of learning and control tasks. The PDP distinguishes from existing methods by two novel techniques: first, we differentiate through Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, and this allows to obtain the analytical derivative of a trajectory with respect to tunable parameters within an optimal control system, enabling end-to-end learning of dynamics, policies, or/and control objective functions; and second, we propose an auxiliary control system in the backward pass of the PDP framework, and the output of this auxiliary control system is the analytical derivative of the original system's trajectory with respect to the parameters, which can be iteratively solved using standard control tools. We investigate three learning modes of the PDP: inverse reinforcement learning, system identification, and control/planning.

"Mixup linearly interpolates pairs of examples to form new samples, which is easy to implement and has been shown to be effective in image classification tasks. However, there are two drawbacks in mixup: one is that more training epochs are needed to obtain a well-trained model; the other is that mixup requires tuning a hyper-parameter to gain appropriate capacity but that is a difficult task. In this paper, we find that mixup constantly explores the representation space, and inspired by the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning, we propose mixup Without hesitation (mWh), a concise, effective, and easy-to-use training algorithm. We show that mWh strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation by gradually replacing mixup with basic data augmentation. It can achieve a strong baseline with less training time than original mixup and without searching for optimal hyper-parameter, i.e., mWh acts as mixup without hesitation. mWh can also transfer to CutMix, and gain consistent improvement on other machine learning and computer vision tasks such as object detection.

"We obtain global, non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for independent learning algorithms in competitive reinforcement learning settings with two agents (i.e., zero-sum stochastic games). We consider an episodic setting where in each episode, each player independently selects a policy and observes only their own actions and rewards, along with the state. We show that if both players run policy gradient methods in tandem, their policies will converge to a min-max equilibrium of the game, as long as their learning rates follow a two-timescale rule (which is necessary). To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first finite-sample convergence result for independent policy gradient methods in competitive RL; prior work has largely focused on centralized, coordinated procedures for equilibrium computation.",0

"Most existing policy learning solutions require the learning agents to receive high-quality supervision signals, e.g., rewards in reinforcement learning (RL) or high-quality expert's demonstrations in behavioral cloning (BC). These quality supervisions are either infeasible or prohibitively expensive to obtain in practice. We aim for a unified framework that leverages the weak supervisions to perform policy learning efficiently. To handle this problem, we treat the ""weak supervisions"" as imperfect information coming from a peer agent, and evaluate the learning agent's policy based on a ""correlated agreement"" with the peer agent's policy (instead of simple agreements). Our way of leveraging peer agent's information offers us a family of solutions that learn effectively from weak supervisions with theoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on tasks including RL with noisy reward, BC with weak demonstrations and standard policy co-training (RL + BC) show that the proposed approach leads to substantial improvements, especially when the complexity or the noise of the learning environments grows.",0

"Abstraction is crucial for effective sequential decision making in domains with large state spaces. In this work, we propose an information bottleneck method for learning approximate bisimulations, a type of state abstraction. We use a deep neural encoder to map states onto continuous embeddings. We map these embeddings onto a discrete representation using an action-conditioned hidden Markov model, which is trained end-to-end with the neural network. Our method is suited for environments with high-dimensional states and learns from a stream of experience collected by an agent acting in a Markov decision process. Through this learned discrete abstract model, we can efficiently plan for unseen goals in a multi-goal Reinforcement Learning setting. We test our method in simplified robotic manipulation domains with image states. We also compare it against previous model-based approaches to finding bisimulations in discrete grid-world-like environments.

"Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable autonomous agents, such as robots, to quickly acquire new behaviors by leveraging prior experience in a set of related training tasks. However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models, which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can \emph{also} perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion signal after only $8$ hours of real world meta-training.

"Agents that interact with other agents often do not know a priori what the other agents' strategies are, but have to maximise their own online return while interacting with and learning about others. The optimal adaptive behaviour under uncertainty over the other agents' strategies w.r.t. some prior can in principle be computed using the Interactive Bayesian Reinforcement Learning framework. Unfortunately, doing so is intractable in most settings, and existing approximation methods are restricted to small tasks. To overcome this, we propose to meta-learn approximate belief inference and Bayes-optimal behaviour for a given prior. To model beliefs over other agents, we combine sequential and hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoders, and meta-train this inference model alongside the policy. We show empirically that our approach outperforms existing methods that use a model-free approach, sample from the approximate posterior, maintain memory-free models of others, or do not fully utilise the known structure of the environment.",0

Finally, the optimal depth is returned to the first stage of DSOL for training, so that DSOL can configure the appropriate ANN depth and perform more reasonable optimization when processing similar datasets again.

"We propose a mechanism for distributed resource management and interference mitigation in wireless networks using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL). We equip each transmitter in the network with a deep RL agent that receives delayed observations from its associated users, while also exchanging observations with its neighboring agents, and decides on which user to serve and what transmit power to use at each scheduling interval. Our proposed framework enables agents to make decisions simultaneously and in a distributed manner, unaware of the concurrent decisions of other agents. Moreover, our design of the agents' observation and action spaces is scalable, in the sense that an agent trained on a scenario with a specific number of transmitters and users can be applied to scenarios with different numbers of transmitters and/or users. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to decentralized baselines in terms of the tradeoff between average and $5^{th}$ percentile user rates, while achieving performance close to, and even in certain cases outperforming, that of a centralized information-theoretic baseline.

"We present a framework to address a class of sequential decision making problems. Our framework features learning the optimal control policy with robustness to noisy data, determining the unknown state and action parameters, and performing sensitivity analysis with respect to problem parameters. We consider two broad categories of sequential decision making problems modelled as infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with (and without) an absorbing state. The central idea underlying our framework is to quantify exploration in terms of the Shannon Entropy of the trajectories under the MDP and determine the stochastic policy that maximizes it while guaranteeing a low value of the expected cost along a trajectory. This resulting policy enhances the quality of exploration early on in the learning process, and consequently allows faster convergence rates and robust solutions even in the presence of noisy data as demonstrated in our comparisons to popular algorithms such as Q-learning, Double Q-learning and entropy regularized Soft Q-learning. The framework extends to the class of parameterized MDP and RL problems, where states and actions are parameter dependent, and the objective is to determine the optimal parameters along with the corresponding optimal policy. Here, the associated cost function can possibly be non-convex with multiple poor local minima. Simulation results applied to a 5G small cell network problem demonstrate successful determination of communication routes and the small cell locations. We also obtain sensitivity measures to problem parameters and robustness to noisy environment data.",0

"Learning multiple domains/tasks with a single model is important for improving data efficiency and lowering inference cost for numerous vision tasks, especially on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, hand-crafting a multi-domain/task model can be both tedious and challenging. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically learn a multi-path network for multi-domain visual classification on mobile devices. The proposed multi-path network is learned from neural architecture search by applying one reinforcement learning controller for each domain to select the best path in the super-network created from a MobileNetV3-like search space. An adaptive balanced domain prioritization algorithm is proposed to balance optimizing the joint model on multiple domains simultaneously. The determined multi-path model selectively shares parameters across domains in shared nodes while keeping domain-specific parameters within non-shared nodes in individual domain paths. This approach effectively reduces the total number of parameters and FLOPS, encouraging positive knowledge transfer while mitigating negative interference across domains. Extensive evaluations on the Visual Decathlon dataset demonstrate that the proposed multi-path model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, model size, and FLOPS against other approaches using MobileNetV3-like architectures.

"We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation where the underlying transition probability kernel of the Markov decision process (MDP) is a linear mixture model (Jia et al., 2020; Ayoub et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) and the learning agent has access to either an integration or a sampling oracle of the individual basis kernels. We propose a new Bernstein-type concentration inequality for self-normalized martingales for linear bandit problems with bounded noise. Based on the new inequality, we propose a new, computationally efficient algorithm with linear function approximation named $\text{UCRL-VTR}^{+}$ for the aforementioned linear mixture MDPs in the episodic undiscounted setting. We show that $\text{UCRL-VTR}^{+}$ attains an $\tilde O(dH\sqrt{T})$ regret where $d$ is the dimension of feature mapping, $H$ is the length of the episode and $T$ is the number of interactions with the MDP. We also prove a matching lower bound $\Omega(dH\sqrt{T})$ for this setting, which shows that $\text{UCRL-VTR}^{+}$ is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. In addition, we propose the $\text{UCLK}^{+}$ algorithm for the same family of MDPs under discounting and show that it attains an $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T}/(1-\gamma)^{1.5})$ regret, where $\gamma\in [0,1)$ is the discount factor. Our upper bound matches the lower bound $\Omega(d\sqrt{T}/(1-\gamma)^{1.5})$ proved by Zhou et al. (2020) up to logarithmic factors, suggesting that $\text{UCLK}^{+}$ is nearly minimax optimal. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first computationally efficient, nearly minimax optimal algorithms for RL with linear function approximation.",0

"Despite the recent successes of reinforcement learning in games and robotics, it is yet to become broadly practical. Sample efficiency and unreliable performance in rare but challenging scenarios are two of the major obstacles. Drawing inspiration from the effectiveness of deliberate practice for achieving expert-level human performance, we propose a new adversarial sampling approach guided by a failure predictor named ""CoachNet"". CoachNet is trained online along with the agent to predict the probability of failure. This probability is then used in a stochastic sampling process to guide the agent to more challenging episodes. This way, instead of wasting time on scenarios that the agent has already mastered, training is focused on the agent's ""weak spots"". We present the design of CoachNet, explain its underlying principles, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in improving sample efficiency and test-time robustness in common continuous control tasks.",0

"Reinforcement Learning has been able to solve many complicated robotics tasks without any need for feature engineering in an end-to-end fashion. However, learning the optimal policy directly from the sensory inputs, i.e the observations, often requires processing and storage of a huge amount of data. In the context of robotics, the cost of data from real robotics hardware is usually very high, thus solutions that achieve high sample-efficiency are needed. We propose a method that aims at learning a mapping from the observations into a lower-dimensional state space. This mapping is learned with unsupervised learning using loss functions shaped to incorporate prior knowledge of the environment and the task. Using the samples from the state space, the optimal policy is quickly and efficiently learned. We test the method on several mobile robot navigation tasks in a simulation environment and also on a real robot.",0

An actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to learn the state estimator approximated by a deep neural network. The convergence of the algorithm is analysed. The proposed Lyapunov-based reinforcement learning state estimator is compared with a number of existing nonlinear filtering methods through Monte Carlo simulations, showing its advantage in terms of estimate convergence even under some system uncertainties such as covariance shift in system noise and randomly missing measurements.

"Exploration is essential for solving complex Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. Maximum State-Visitation Entropy (MSVE) formulates the exploration problem as a well-defined policy optimization problem whose solution aims at visiting all states as uniformly as possible. This is in contrast to standard uncertainty-based approaches where exploration is transient and eventually vanishes. However, existing approaches to MSVE are theoretically justified only for discrete state-spaces as they are oblivious to the geometry of continuous domains. We address this challenge by introducing Geometric Entropy Maximisation (GEM), a new algorithm that maximises the geometry-aware Shannon entropy of state-visits in both discrete and continuous domains. Our key theoretical contribution is casting geometry-aware MSVE exploration as a tractable problem of optimising a simple and novel noise-contrastive objective function. In our experiments, we show the efficiency of GEM in solving several RL problems with sparse rewards, compared against other deep RL exploration approaches.",0

"This paper aims to mitigate straggler effects in synchronous distributed learning for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems. Stragglers arise frequently in a distributed learning system, due to the existence of various system disturbances such as slow-downs or failures of compute nodes and communication bottlenecks. To resolve this issue, we propose a coded distributed learning framework, which speeds up the training of MARL algorithms in the presence of stragglers, while maintaining the same accuracy as the centralized approach. As an illustration, a coded distributed version of the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient(MADDPG) algorithm is developed and evaluated.

"Transfer reinforcement learning aims to improve the sample efficiency of solving unseen new tasks by leveraging experiences obtained from previous tasks. We consider the setting where all tasks (MDPs) share the same environment dynamic except reward function. In this setting, the MDP dynamic is a good knowledge to transfer, which can be inferred by uniformly random policy. However, trajectories generated by uniform random policy are not useful for policy improvement, which impairs the sample efficiency severely. Instead, we observe that the binary MDP dynamic can be inferred from trajectories of any policy which avoids the need of uniform random policy. As the binary MDP dynamic contains the state structure shared over all tasks we believe it is suitable to transfer. Built on this observation, we introduce a method to infer the binary MDP dynamic on-line and at the same time utilize it to guide state embedding learning, which is then transferred to new tasks. We keep state embedding learning and policy learning separately. As a result, the learned state embedding is task and policy agnostic which makes it ideal for transfer learning. In addition, to facilitate the exploration over the state space, we propose a novel intrinsic reward based on the inferred binary MDP dynamic. Our method can be used out-of-box in combination with model-free RL algorithms. We show two instances on the basis of \algo{DQN} and \algo{A2C}. Empirical results of intensive experiments show the advantage of our proposed method in various transfer learning tasks.",0

The scenario considered in this study is where all tasks or Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) share the same environment dynamic, except for the reward function. In this situation, the MDP dynamic can be transferred as it is a good source of knowledge that can be inferred through a uniformly random policy.

"We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation under the adaptivity constraint. We consider two popular limited adaptivity models: batch learning model and rare policy switch model, and propose two efficient online RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes. In specific, for the batch learning model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-Batch algorithm achieves an $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T} + dHT/B)$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of interactions and $B$ is the number of batches. Our result suggests that it suffices to use only $\sqrt{T/dH}$ batches to obtain $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. For the rare policy switch model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch algorithm enjoys an $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T[1+T/(dH)]^{dH/B}})$ regret, which implies that $dH\log T$ policy switches suffice to obtain the $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret.

"Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms making use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization as a core component have shown outstanding performance. Yet, only little is understood theoretically about why KL regularization helps, so far. We study KL regularization within an approximate value iteration scheme and show that it implicitly averages q-values. Leveraging this insight, we provide a very strong performance bound, the very first to combine two desirable aspects: a linear dependency to the horizon (instead of quadratic) and an error propagation term involving an averaging effect of the estimation errors (instead of an accumulation effect). We also study the more general case of an additional entropy regularizer. The resulting abstract scheme encompasses many existing RL algorithms. Some of our assumptions do not hold with neural networks, so we complement this theoretical analysis with an extensive empirical study.",0

"In this paper, a novel training paradigm inspired by quantum computation is proposed for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with experience replay. In contrast to traditional experience replay mechanism in DRL, the proposed deep reinforcement learning with quantum-inspired experience replay (DRL-QER) adaptively chooses experiences from the replay buffer according to the complexity and the replayed times of each experience (also called transition), to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. In DRL-QER, transitions are first formulated in quantum representations, and then the preparation operation and the depreciation operation are performed on the transitions. In this progress, the preparation operation reflects the relationship between the temporal difference errors (TD-errors) and the importance of the experiences, while the depreciation operation is taken into account to ensure the diversity of the transitions. The experimental results on Atari 2600 games show that DRL-QER outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as DRL-PER and DCRL on most of these games with improved training efficiency, and is also applicable to such memory-based DRL approaches as double network and dueling network.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and evolution strategies (ES) have been applied to various tasks, showing excellent performances. These have the opposite properties, with DRL having good sample efficiency and poor stability, while ES being vice versa. Recently, there have been attempts to combine these algorithms, but these methods fully rely on synchronous update scheme, making it not ideal to maximize the benefits of the parallelism in ES. To solve this challenge, asynchronous update scheme was introduced, which is capable of good time-efficiency and diverse policy exploration. In this paper, we introduce an Asynchronous Evolution Strategy-Reinforcement Learning (AES-RL) that maximizes the parallel efficiency of ES and integrates it with policy gradient methods. Specifically, we propose 1) a novel framework to merge ES and DRL asynchronously and 2) various asynchronous update methods that can take all advantages of asynchronism, ES, and DRL, which are exploration and time efficiency, stability, and sample efficiency, respectively.

"Temporal information is essential to learning effective policies with Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, current state-of-the-art RL algorithms either assume that such information is given as part of the state space or, when learning from pixels, use the simple heuristic of frame-stacking to implicitly capture temporal information present in the image observations. This heuristic is in contrast to the current paradigm in video classification architectures, which utilize explicit encodings of temporal information through methods such as optical flow and two-stream architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Inspired by leading video classification architectures, we introduce the Flow of Latents for Reinforcement Learning (Flare), a network architecture for RL that explicitly encodes temporal information through latent vector differences.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms update an agent's parameters according to one of several possible rules, discovered manually through years of research. Automating the discovery of update rules from data could lead to more efficient algorithms, or algorithms that are better adapted to specific environments. Although there have been prior attempts at addressing this significant scientific challenge, it remains an open question whether it is feasible to discover alternatives to fundamental concepts of RL such as value functions and temporal-difference learning. This paper introduces a new meta-learning approach that discovers an entire update rule which includes both 'what to predict' (e.g. value functions) and 'how to learn from it' (e.g. bootstrapping) by interacting with a set of environments. The output of this method is an RL algorithm that we call Learned Policy Gradient (LPG). Empirical results show that our method discovers its own alternative to the concept of value functions. Furthermore it discovers a bootstrapping mechanism to maintain and use its predictions. Surprisingly, when trained solely on toy environments, LPG generalises effectively to complex Atari games and achieves non-trivial performance. This shows the potential to discover general RL algorithms from data.",0

"The combination of high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning have proven useful in many sustainability-related tasks, including poverty prediction, infrastructure measurement, and forest monitoring. However, the accuracy afforded by high-resolution imagery comes at a cost, as such imagery is extremely expensive to purchase at scale. This creates a substantial hurdle to the efficient scaling and widespread adoption of high-resolution-based approaches. To reduce acquisition costs while maintaining accuracy, we propose a reinforcement learning approach in which free low-resolution imagery is used to dynamically identify where to acquire costly high-resolution images, prior to performing a deep learning task on the high-resolution images. We apply this approach to the task of poverty prediction in Uganda, building on an earlier approach that used object detection to count objects and use these counts to predict poverty. Our approach exceeds previous performance benchmarks on this task while using 80% fewer high-resolution images. Our approach could have application in many sustainability domains that require high-resolution imagery.",0

"Motion synthesis in a dynamic environment has been a long-standing problem for character animation. Methods using motion capture data tend to scale poorly in complex environments because of their larger capturing and labeling requirement. Physics-based controllers are effective in this regard, albeit less controllable. In this paper, we present CARL, a quadruped agent that can be controlled with high-level directives and react naturally to dynamic environments. Starting with an agent that can imitate individual animation clips, we use Generative Adversarial Networks to adapt high-level controls, such as speed and heading, to action distributions that correspond to the original animations. Further fine-tuning through the deep reinforcement learning enables the agent to recover from unseen external perturbations while producing smooth transitions. It then becomes straightforward to create autonomous agents in dynamic environments by adding navigation modules over the entire process. We evaluate our approach by measuring the agent's ability to follow user control and provide a visual analysis of the generated motion to show its effectiveness.",0

The visual and driving modules extract generic and driving-specific visual features, respectively, from a front-view driving video and corresponding eye fixations provided by humans. The attention module then learns intrinsic task-sensitive reward functions based on eye fixation policies recorded from attentive drivers. Using the learned policies, MEDIRL predicts the visual attention allocation of drivers. We also introduce a new driver visual attention dataset called EyeCar, which captures accident-prone situations. Our experiments demonstrate that MEDIRL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on driving task-related visual attention allocation for large-scale driving attention benchmark datasets, including DR(eye)VE, BDD-A, and DADA-2000. For reproducibility, we provide the code and dataset.",1
"This paper proposes a definition of system health in the context of multiple agents optimizing a joint reward function. We use this definition as a credit assignment term in a policy gradient algorithm to distinguish the contributions of individual agents to the global reward. The health-informed credit assignment is then extended to a multi-agent variant of the proximal policy optimization algorithm and demonstrated on particle and multiwalker robot environments that have characteristics such as system health, risk-taking, semi-expendable agents, continuous action spaces, and partial observability. We show significant improvement in learning performance compared to policy gradient methods that do not perform multi-agent credit assignment.",0
"In this paper, we suggest a definition of system health with reference to multiple agents working towards a common goal.

We evaluate our approach on particle and multiwalker robot environments that possess attributes such as system health, risk-taking, semi-expendable agents, continuous action spaces, and partial observability. Our results show a significant improvement in learning performance when compared to policy gradient methods that do not include multi-agent credit assignment.",1
"In value-based reinforcement learning (RL), unlike in supervised learning, the agent faces not a single, stationary, approximation problem, but a sequence of value prediction problems. Each time the policy improves, the nature of the problem changes, shifting both the distribution of states and their values. In this paper we take a novel perspective, arguing that the value prediction problems faced by an RL agent should not be addressed in isolation, but rather as a single, holistic, prediction problem. An RL algorithm generates a sequence of policies that, at least approximately, improve towards the optimal policy. We explicitly characterize the associated sequence of value functions and call it the value-improvement path. Our main idea is to approximate the value-improvement path holistically, rather than to solely track the value function of the current policy. Specifically, we discuss the impact that this holistic view of RL has on representation learning. We demonstrate that a representation that spans the past value-improvement path will also provide an accurate value approximation for future policy improvements. We use this insight to better understand existing approaches to auxiliary tasks and to propose new ones. To test our hypothesis empirically, we augmented a standard deep RL agent with an auxiliary task of learning the value-improvement path. In a study of Atari 2600 games, the augmented agent achieved approximately double the mean and median performance of the baseline agent.",0
"In value-based reinforcement learning, the agent is faced with a series of value prediction problems as opposed to a singular, fixed approximation problem like in supervised learning. With each policy improvement, the problem changes, causing a shift in the distribution of states and their values. This paper presents a new perspective, arguing that instead of addressing these value prediction problems in isolation, they should be viewed as a single, holistic prediction problem. The RL algorithm generates a sequence of policies that move towards the optimal policy, creating a value-improvement path. Rather than solely tracking the value function of the current policy, the paper proposes approximating the value-improvement path as a whole. This approach has significant ramifications for representation learning, as a representation that spans the past value-improvement path can accurately predict future policy improvements. The paper tests this hypothesis by adding an auxiliary task of learning the value-improvement path to a standard deep RL agent and achieves double the mean and median performance of the baseline agent in a study of Atari 2600 games.",1
"Offline reinforcement learning (RL), also known as batch RL, aims to optimize policy from a large pre-recorded dataset without interaction with the environment. This setting offers the promise of utilizing diverse, pre-collected datasets to obtain policies without costly, risky, active exploration. However, commonly used off-policy algorithms based on Q-learning or actor-critic perform poorly when learning from a static dataset. In this work, we study why off-policy RL methods fail to learn in offline setting from the value function view, and we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that we call Pessimistic Offline Policy Optimization (POPO), which learns a pessimistic value function to get a strong policy. We find that POPO performs surprisingly well and scales to tasks with high-dimensional state and action space, comparing or outperforming several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on benchmark tasks.",0

"Safety is a critical concern when deploying reinforcement learning agents for realistic tasks. Recently, safe reinforcement learning algorithms have been developed to optimize the agent's performance while avoiding violations of safety constraints. However, few studies have addressed the non-stationary disturbances in the environments, which may cause catastrophic outcomes. In this paper, we propose the context-aware safe reinforcement learning (CASRL) method, a meta-learning framework to realize safe adaptation in non-stationary environments. We use a probabilistic latent variable model to achieve fast inference of the posterior environment transition distribution given the context data. Safety constraints are then evaluated with uncertainty-aware trajectory sampling. The high cost of safety violations leads to the rareness of unsafe records in the dataset. We address this issue by enabling prioritized sampling during model training and formulating prior safety constraints with domain knowledge during constrained planning. The algorithm is evaluated in realistic safety-critical environments with non-stationary disturbances. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of safety and robustness.",0

"Many real-world applications, such as those in medical domains, recommendation systems, etc, can be formulated as large state space reinforcement learning problems with only a small budget of the number of policy changes, i.e., low switching cost. This paper focuses on the linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) recently studied in [Yang et al 2019, Jin et al 2020] where the linear function approximation is used for generalization on the large state space. We present the first algorithm for linear MDP with a low switching cost. Our algorithm achieves an $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{d^3H^4K}\right)$ regret bound with a near-optimal $O\left(d H\log K\right)$ global switching cost where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the planning horizon and $K$ is the number of episodes the agent plays. Our regret bound matches the best existing polynomial algorithm by [Jin et al 2020] and our switching cost is exponentially smaller than theirs. When specialized to tabular MDP, our switching cost bound improves those in [Bai et al 2019, Zhang et al 20020]. We complement our positive result with an $\Omega\left(dH/\log d\right)$ global switching cost lower bound for any no-regret algorithm.",0

"As reinforcement learning techniques are increasingly applied to real-world decision problems, attention has turned to how these algorithms use potentially sensitive information. We consider the task of training a policy that maximizes reward while minimizing disclosure of certain sensitive state variables through the actions. We give examples of how this setting covers real-world problems in privacy for sequential decision-making. We solve this problem in the policy gradients framework by introducing a regularizer based on the mutual information (MI) between the sensitive state and the actions at a given timestep. We develop a model-based stochastic gradient estimator for optimization of privacy-constrained policies. We also discuss an alternative MI regularizer that serves as an upper bound to our main MI regularizer and can be optimized in a model-free setting. We contrast previous work in differentially-private RL to our mutual-information formulation of information disclosure. Experimental results show that our training method results in policies which hide the sensitive state.",0

"There is a growing interest in the learning-to-learn paradigm, also known as meta-learning, where models infer on new tasks using a few training examples. Recently, meta-learning based methods have been widely used in few-shot classification, regression, reinforcement learning, and domain adaptation. The model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm is a well-known algorithm that obtains model parameter initialization at meta-training phase. In the meta-test phase, this initialization is rapidly adapted to new tasks by using gradient descent. However, meta-learning models are prone to overfitting since there are insufficient training tasks resulting in over-parameterized models with poor generalization performance for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian neural network based MAML algorithm, which we refer to as the B-SMALL algorithm. The proposed framework incorporates a sparse variational loss term alongside the loss function of MAML, which uses a sparsifying approximated KL divergence as a regularizer. We demonstrate the performance of B-MAML using classification and regression tasks, and highlight that training a sparsifying BNN using MAML indeed improves the parameter footprint of the model while performing at par or even outperforming the MAML approach. We also illustrate applicability of our approach in distributed sensor networks, where sparsity and meta-learning can be beneficial.",0

"This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning for autonomous navigation using distance and semantic category observations. The objective is to infer a cost function that explains demonstrated behavior while relying only on the expert's observations and state-control trajectory. We develop a map encoder, that infers semantic category probabilities from the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined as a deep neural network over the semantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly observable, the model parameters can only be optimized by differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost estimate. We propose a new model of expert behavior that enables error minimization using a closed-form subgradient computed only over a subset of promising states via a motion planning algorithm. Our approach allows generalizing the learned behavior to new environments with new spatial configurations of the semantic categories.

"In the real world, people/entities usually find matches independently and autonomously, such as finding jobs, partners, roommates, etc. It is possible that this search for matches starts with no initial knowledge of the environment. We propose the use of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) paradigm for a spatially formulated decentralized two-sided matching market with independent and autonomous agents. Having autonomous agents acting independently makes our environment very dynamic and uncertain. Moreover, agents lack the knowledge of preferences of other agents and have to explore the environment and interact with other agents to discover their own preferences through noisy rewards. We think such a setting better approximates the real world and we study the usefulness of our MARL approach for it. Along with conventional stable matching case where agents have strictly ordered preferences, we check the applicability of our approach for stable matching with incomplete lists and ties. We investigate our results for stability, level of instability (for unstable results), and fairness. Our MARL approach mostly yields stable and fair outcomes.",0

"Learning-to-rank (LTR) has become a key technology in E-commerce applications. Most existing LTR approaches follow a supervised learning paradigm from offline labeled data collected from the online system. However, it has been noticed that previous LTR models can have a good validation performance over offline validation data but have a poor online performance, and vice versa, which implies a possible large inconsistency between the offline and online evaluation. We investigate and confirm in this paper that such inconsistency exists and can have a significant impact on AliExpress Search. Reasons for the inconsistency include the ignorance of item context during the learning, and the offline data set is insufficient for learning the context. Therefore, this paper proposes an evaluator-generator framework for LTR with item context. The framework consists of an evaluator that generalizes to evaluate recommendations involving the context, and a generator that maximizes the evaluator score by reinforcement learning, and a discriminator that ensures the generalization of the evaluator. Extensive experiments in simulation environments and AliExpress Search online system show that, firstly, the classic data-based metrics on the offline dataset can show significant inconsistency with online performance, and can even be misleading. Secondly, the proposed evaluator score is significantly more consistent with the online performance than common ranking metrics. Finally, as the consequence, our method achieves a significant improvement (\textgreater$2\%$) in terms of Conversion Rate (CR) over the industrial-level fine-tuned model in online A/B tests.",0

"Asynchronous and parallel implementation of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is a key enabler of the tremendous success of modern RL. Among many asynchronous RL algorithms, arguably the most popular and effective one is the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm. Although A3C is becoming the workhorse of RL, its theoretical properties are still not well-understood, including the non-asymptotic analysis and the performance gain of parallelism (a.k.a. speedup). This paper revisits the A3C algorithm with TD(0) for the critic update, termed A3C-TD(0), with provable convergence guarantees. With linear value function approximation for the TD update, the convergence of A3C-TD(0) is established under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling. Under i.i.d. sampling, A3C-TD(0) obtains sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5}/N)$ per worker to achieve $\epsilon$ accuracy, where $N$ is the number of workers. Compared to the best-known sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ for two-timescale AC, A3C-TD(0) achieves \emph{linear speedup}, which justifies the advantage of parallelism and asynchrony in AC algorithms theoretically for the first time. Numerical tests on synthetically generated instances and OpenAI Gym environments have been provided to verify our theoretical analysis.",0

"A generalist robot must be able to complete a variety of tasks in its environment. One appealing way to specify each task is in terms of a goal observation.

"We consider the task of Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In this setting, contexts, which define the reward and transition kernel, are sampled from a distribution. In addition, although the reward is a function of the context, it is not provided to the agent. Instead, the agent observes demonstrations from an optimal policy. The goal is to learn the reward mapping, such that the agent will act optimally even when encountering previously unseen contexts, also known as zero-shot transfer.

"We propose a framework for transferring any existing policy from a potentially unknown source MDP to a target MDP. This framework (1) enables reuse in the target domain of any form of source policy, including classical controllers, heuristic policies, or deep neural network-based policies, (2) attains optimality under suitable theoretical conditions, and (3) guarantees improvement over the source policy in the target MDP. These are achieved by packaging the source policy as a black-box option in the target MDP and providing a theoretically grounded way to learn the option's initiation set through general value functions. Our approach facilitates the learning of new policies by (1) maximizing the target MDP reward with the help of the black-box option, and (2) returning the agent to states in the learned initiation set of the black-box option where it is already optimal. We show that these two variants are equivalent in performance under some conditions. Through a series of experiments in simulated environments, we demonstrate that our framework performs excellently in sparse reward problems given (sub-)optimal source policies and improves upon prior art in transfer methods such as continual learning and progressive networks, which lack our framework's desirable theoretical properties.",0

"The classical theory of reinforcement learning (RL) has focused on tabular and linear representations of value functions. Further progress hinges on combining RL with modern function approximators such as kernel functions and deep neural networks, and indeed there have been many empirical successes that have exploited such combinations in large-scale applications. There are profound challenges, however, in developing a theory to support this enterprise, most notably the need to take into consideration the exploration-exploitation tradeoff at the core of RL in conjunction with the computational and statistical tradeoffs that arise in modern function-approximation-based learning systems. We approach these challenges by studying an optimistic modification of the least-squares value iteration algorithm, in the context of the action-value function   represented by a kernel function or an overparameterized neural network. We establish both polynomial runtime complexity and polynomial sample complexity for this algorithm, without additional assumptions on the data-generating model. In particular, we prove that the algorithm incurs an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\delta_{\mathcal{F}} H^2 \sqrt{T})$ regret, where $\delta_{\mathcal{F}}$ characterizes the intrinsic complexity of the function class $\mathcal{F}$, $H$ is the length of each episode, and $T$ is the total number of episodes.

Based on the derived gradient, we present an algorithm, f-IRL, that recovers a stationary reward function from the expert density by gradient descent. We show that f-IRL can learn behaviors from a hand-designed target state density or implicitly through expert observations. Our method outperforms adversarial imitation learning methods in terms of sample efficiency and the required number of expert trajectories on IRL benchmarks.

The key contribution is the analytic gradient of any f-divergence between the agent and expert state distribution with respect to reward parameters. This gradient is used to develop an algorithm, f-IRL, that retrieves a stationary reward function from the expert density through gradient descent. Our method surpasses adversarial imitation learning techniques in terms of sample efficiency and required number of expert trajectories on IRL benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the retrieved reward function can solve downstream tasks quickly and is useful for behavior transfer across changes in dynamics, specifically on hard-to-explore tasks.",1
"Network architecture search (NAS) achieves state-of-the-art results in various tasks such as classification and semantic segmentation. Recently, a reinforcement learning-based approach has been proposed for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) search. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for GAN search by using a method called DEGAS (Differentiable Efficient GenerAtor Search), which focuses on efficiently finding the generator in the GAN. Our search algorithm is inspired by the differential architecture search strategy and the Global Latent Optimization (GLO) procedure. This leads to both an efficient and stable GAN search. After the generator architecture is found, it can be plugged into any existing framework for GAN training. For CTGAN, which we use in this work, the new model outperforms the original inception score results by 0.25 for CIFAR-10 and 0.77 for STL. It also gets better results than the RL based GAN search methods in shorter search time.",0

"Previous work has shown the unreliability of existing algorithms in the batch Reinforcement Learning setting, and proposed the theoretically-grounded Safe Policy Improvement with Baseline Bootstrapping (SPIBB) fix: reproduce the baseline policy in the uncertain state-action pairs, in order to control the variance on the trained policy performance. However, in many real-world applications such as dialogue systems, pharmaceutical tests or crop management, data is collected under human supervision and the baseline remains unknown. In this paper, we apply SPIBB algorithms with a baseline estimate built from the data. We formally show safe policy improvement guarantees over the true baseline even without direct access to it. Our empirical experiments on finite and continuous states tasks support the theoretical findings. It shows little loss of performance in comparison with SPIBB when the baseline policy is given, and more importantly, drastically and significantly outperforms competing algorithms both in safe policy improvement, and in average performance.",0
"Prior research has identified the inadequacy of current algorithms in the batch Reinforcement Learning context and suggested a solution called Safe Policy Improvement with Baseline Bootstrapping (SPIBB), which is based on sound theoretical principles. The SPIBB approach involves replicating the baseline policy in uncertain state-action pairs to manage variations in the trained policy's performance. Nonetheless, in real-world scenarios such as pharmaceutical tests, crop management, and dialogue systems, data is typically gathered under human oversight, and the baseline remains unknown. This study employs SPIBB algorithms with a baseline estimation derived from data. We demonstrate, with formal evidence, that safe policy improvement guarantees can be obtained even without direct access to the true baseline. Our experimental results on tasks with finite and continuous states validate the theoretical findings. The findings reveal that the approach has a negligible loss of performance when compared to SPIBB, which has access to the baseline policy, and more importantly, it outperforms rival algorithms considerably in both safe policy improvement and average performance.",1
"The capability of imagining internally with a mental model of the world is vitally important for human cognition. If a machine intelligent agent can learn a world model to create a ""dream"" environment, it can then internally ask what-if questions -- simulate the alternative futures that haven't been experienced in the past yet -- and make optimal decisions accordingly. Existing world models are established typically by learning spatio-temporal regularities embedded from the past sensory signal without taking into account confounding factors that influence state transition dynamics. As such, they fail to answer the critical counterfactual questions about ""what would have happened"" if a certain action policy was taken. In this paper, we propose Causal World Models (CWMs) that allow unsupervised modeling of relationships between the intervened observations and the alternative futures by learning an estimator of the latent confounding factors. We empirically evaluate our method and demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of physical reasoning environments. Specifically, we show reductions in sample complexity for reinforcement learning tasks and improvements in counterfactual physical reasoning.",0

"While deep reinforcement learning has achieved tremendous successes in various applications, most existing works only focus on maximizing the expected value of total return and thus ignore its inherent stochasticity. Such stochasticity is also known as the aleatoric uncertainty and is closely related to the notion of risk. In this work, we make the first attempt to study risk-sensitive deep reinforcement learning under the average reward setting with the variance risk criteria. In particular, we focus on a variance-constrained policy optimization problem where the goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected value of the long-run average reward, subject to a constraint that the long-run variance of the average reward is upper bounded by a threshold. Utilizing Lagrangian and Fenchel dualities, we transform the original problem into an unconstrained saddle-point policy optimization problem, and propose an actor-critic algorithm that iteratively and efficiently updates the policy, the Lagrange multiplier, and the Fenchel dual variable. When both the value and policy functions are represented by multi-layer overparameterized neural networks, we prove that our actor-critic algorithm generates a sequence of policies that finds a globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate.",0

"Traffic signal controllers play an essential role in today's traffic system. However, the majority of them currently is not sufficiently flexible or adaptive to generate optimal traffic schedules. In this paper we present an approach to learning policies for signal controllers using deep reinforcement learning aiming for optimized traffic flow. Our method uses a novel formulation of the reward function that simultaneously considers efficiency and equity. We furthermore present a general approach to find the bound for the proposed equity factor and we introduce the adaptive discounting approach that greatly stabilizes learning and helps to maintain a high flexibility of green light duration.

"Social goods, such as healthcare, smart city, and information networks, often produce ordered event data in continuous time. The generative processes of these event data can be very complex, requiring flexible models to capture their dynamics. Temporal point processes offer an elegant framework for modeling event data without discretizing the time. However, the existing maximum-likelihood-estimation (MLE) learning paradigm requires hand-crafting the intensity function beforehand and cannot directly monitor the goodness-of-fit of the estimated model in the process of training. To alleviate the risk of model-misspecification in MLE, we propose to generate samples from the generative model and monitor the quality of the samples in the process of training until the samples and the real data are indistinguishable. We take inspiration from reinforcement learning (RL) and treat the generation of each event as the action taken by a stochastic policy. We parameterize the policy as a flexible recurrent neural network and gradually improve the policy to mimic the observed event distribution. Since the reward function is unknown in this setting, we uncover an analytic and nonparametric form of the reward function using an inverse reinforcement learning formulation. This new RL framework allows us to derive an efficient policy gradient algorithm for learning flexible point process models, and we show that it performs well in both synthetic and real data.",0

"Existing neural network-based autonomous systems are shown to be vulnerable against adversarial attacks, therefore sophisticated evaluation on their robustness is of great importance. However, evaluating the robustness only under the worst-case scenarios based on known attacks is not comprehensive, not to mention that some of them even rarely occur in the real world. In addition, the distribution of safety-critical data is usually multimodal, while most traditional attacks and evaluation methods focus on a single modality. To solve the above challenges, we propose a flow-based multimodal safety-critical scenario generator for evaluating decisionmaking algorithms. The proposed generative model is optimized with weighted likelihood maximization and a gradient-based sampling procedure is integrated to improve the sampling efficiency. The safety-critical scenarios are generated by querying the task algorithms and the log-likelihood of the generated scenarios is in proportion to the risk level. Experiments on a self-driving task demonstrate our advantages in terms of testing efficiency and multimodal modeling capability. We evaluate six Reinforcement Learning algorithms with our generated traffic scenarios and provide empirical conclusions about their robustness.",0

"AlphaGo's astonishing performance has ignited an explosive interest in developing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for numerous real-world applications, such as intelligent robotics. However, the often prohibitive complexity of DRL stands at the odds with the required real-time control and constrained resources in many DRL applications, limiting the great potential of DRL powered intelligent devices. While substantial efforts have been devoted to compressing other deep learning models, existing works barely touch the surface of compressing DRL. In this work, we first identify that there exists an optimal model size of DRL that can maximize both the test scores and efficiency, motivating the need for task-specific DRL agents. We therefore propose an Auto-Agent-Distiller (A2D) framework, which to our best knowledge is the first neural architecture search (NAS) applied to DRL to automatically search for the optimal DRL agents for various tasks that optimize both the test scores and efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that vanilla NAS can easily fail in searching for the optimal agents, due to its resulting high variance in DRL training stability, and then develop a novel distillation mechanism to distill the knowledge from both the teacher agent's actor and critic to stabilize the searching process and improve the searched agents' optimality. Extensive experiments and ablation studies consistently validate our findings and the advantages and general applicability of our A2D, outperforming manually designed DRL in both the test scores and efficiency.

"This paper proposes a new robust update rule of target network for deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to replace the conventional update rule, given as an exponential moving average. The target network is for smoothly generating the reference signals for a main network in DRL, thereby reducing learning variance. The problem with its conventional update rule is the fact that all the parameters are smoothly copied with the same speed from the main network, even when some of them are trying to update toward the wrong directions. This behavior increases the risk of generating the wrong reference signals. Although slowing down the overall update speed is a naive way to mitigate wrong updates, it would decrease learning speed. To robustly update the parameters while keeping learning speed, a t-soft update method, which is inspired by student-t distribution, is derived with reference to the analogy between the exponential moving average and the normal distribution. Through the analysis of the derived t-soft update, we show that it takes over the properties of the student-t distribution. Specifically, with a heavy-tailed property of the student-t distribution, the t-soft update automatically excludes extreme updates that differ from past experiences. In addition, when the updates are similar to the past experiences, it can mitigate the learning delay by increasing the amount of updates. In PyBullet robotics simulations for DRL, an online actor-critic algorithm with the t-soft update outperformed the conventional methods in terms of the obtained return and/or its variance. From the training process by the t-soft update, we found that the t-soft update is globally consistent with the standard soft update, and the update rates are locally adjusted for acceleration or suppression.",0
"This paper introduces a new update rule for the target network in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that is more robust than the conventional exponential moving average method. The target network is responsible for producing reference signals for the main network in DRL, and the new method aims to reduce learning variance. The issue with the conventional method is that all parameters are copied at the same rate, even those moving in the wrong direction, which increases the risk of producing incorrect reference signals. Slowing down the update speed is not an effective solution as it decreases learning speed. To address this problem, the authors propose a t-soft update method based on the student-t distribution that robustly updates parameters while maintaining learning speed. The t-soft update automatically excludes extreme updates and can increase the amount of updates to mitigate learning delays. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the t-soft update in PyBullet robotics simulations for DRL, achieving better returns and/or variance compared to conventional methods. The t-soft update is globally consistent with the standard soft update, and its update rates are locally adjusted for acceleration or suppression during the training process.",1
"In this paper we consider the problem of learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP). Given an MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, the discount factor $\gamma \in (0,1)$, and an approximation threshold $\epsilon > 0$, we provide a model-free algorithm to learn an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\frac{SA\ln(1/p)}{\epsilon^2(1-\gamma)^{5.5}})$ (where the notation $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides poly-logarithmic factors of $S,A,1/(1-\gamma)$, and $1/\epsilon$) and success probability $(1-p)$. For small enough $\epsilon$, we show an improved algorithm with sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\frac{SA\ln(1/p)}{\epsilon^2(1-\gamma)^{3}})$.

"Policy gradient methods are among the most effective methods for large-scale reinforcement learning, and their empirical success has prompted several works that develop the foundation of their global convergence theory. However, prior works have either required exact gradients or state-action visitation measure based mini-batch stochastic gradients with a diverging batch size, which limit their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we consider classical policy gradient methods that compute an approximate gradient with a single trajectory or a fixed size mini-batch of trajectories under soft-max parametrization and log-barrier regularization, along with the widely-used REINFORCE gradient estimation procedure. By controlling the number of ""bad"" episodes and resorting to the classical doubling trick, we establish an anytime sub-linear high probability regret bound as well as almost sure global convergence of the average regret with an asymptotically sub-linear rate.

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used to learn effective heuristics for solving complex combinatorial optimisation problem via policy networks and have demonstrated promising performance. Existing works have focused on solving (vehicle) routing problems as they have a nice balance between non-triviality and difficulty. State-of-the-art approaches learn a policy using reinforcement learning, and the learnt policy acts as a pseudo solver. These approaches have demonstrated good performance in some cases, but given the large search space typical combinatorial/routing problem, they can converge too quickly to poor policy. To prevent this, in this paper, we propose an approach name entropy regularised reinforcement learning (ERRL) that supports exploration by providing more stochastic policies, which tends to improve optimisation. Empirically, the low variance ERRL offers RL training fast and stable. We also introduce a combination of local search operators during test time, which significantly improves solution and complement ERRL. We qualitatively demonstrate that for vehicle routing problems, a policy with higher entropy can make the optimisation landscape smooth which makes it easier to optimise. The quantitative evaluation shows that the performance of the model is comparable with the state-of-the-art variants. In our evaluation, we experimentally illustrate that the model produces state-of-the-art performance on variants of Vehicle Routing problems such as Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Multiple Routing with Fixed Fleet Problems (MRPFF) and Travelling Salesman problem.",0

"Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is the problem of evaluating new policies using historical data obtained from a different policy. In the recent OPE context, most studies have focused on single-player cases, and not on multi-player cases. In this study, we propose OPE estimators constructed by the doubly robust and double reinforcement learning estimators in two-player zero-sum Markov games. The proposed estimators project exploitability that is often used as a metric for determining how close a policy profile (i.e., a tuple of policies) is to a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games. We prove the exploitability estimation error bounds for the proposed estimators. We then propose the methods to find the best candidate policy profile by selecting the policy profile that minimizes the estimated exploitability from a given policy profile class. We prove the regret bounds of the policy profiles selected by our methods. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed estimators through experiments.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies have been shown to be deceived by perturbations (e.g., random noise or intensional adversarial attacks) on state observations that appear at test time but are unknown during training. To increase the robustness of DRL policies, previous approaches assume that the knowledge of adversaries can be added into the training process to achieve the corresponding generalization ability on these perturbed observations. However, such an assumption not only makes the robustness improvement more expensive but may also leave a model less effective to other kinds of attacks in the wild. In contrast, we propose an adversary agnostic robust DRL paradigm that does not require learning from adversaries. To this end, we first theoretically derive that robustness could indeed be achieved independently of the adversaries based on a policy distillation setting. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new policy distillation loss with two terms: 1) a prescription gap maximization loss aiming at simultaneously maximizing the likelihood of the action selected by the teacher policy and the entropy over the remaining actions; 2) a corresponding Jacobian regularization loss that minimizes the magnitude of the gradient with respect to the input state. The theoretical analysis shows that our distillation loss guarantees to increase the prescription gap and the adversarial robustness. Furthermore, experiments on five Atari games firmly verify the superiority of our approach in terms of boosting adversarial robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly explored to learn the cooperative policy towards maximizing a certain global reward. Many existing studies take advantage of graph neural networks (GNN) in MARL to propagate critical collaborative information over the interaction graph, built upon inter-connected agents. Nevertheless, the vanilla GNN approach yields substantial defects in dealing with complex real-world scenarios since the generic message passing mechanism is ineffective between heterogeneous vertices and, moreover, simple message aggregation functions are incapable of accurately modeling the combinational interactions from multiple neighbors. While adopting complex GNN models with more informative message passing and aggregation mechanisms can obviously benefit heterogeneous vertex representations and cooperative policy learning, it could, on the other hand, increase the training difficulty of MARL and demand more intense and direct reward signals compared to the original global reward. To address these challenges, we propose a new cooperative learning framework with pre-trained heterogeneous observation representations. Particularly, we employ an encoder-decoder based graph attention to learn the intricate interactions and heterogeneous representations that can be more easily leveraged by MARL. Moreover, we design a pre-training with local actor-critic algorithm to ease the difficulty in cooperative policy learning. Extensive experiments over real-world scenarios demonstrate that our new approach can significantly outperform existing MARL baselines as well as operational research solutions that are widely-used in industry.",0
"MARL is being increasingly studied as a way to learn how to maximize a global reward through cooperative policies. To achieve this, many studies use GNNs to propagate collaborative information across interconnected agents in an interaction graph.

Although more complex GNN models could improve vertex representations and policy learning, they could also make MARL training more challenging and require more direct reward signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new cooperative learning framework that uses pre-trained heterogeneous observation representations and an encoder-decoder based graph attention mechanism. Additionally, we design a pre-training process using a local actor-critic algorithm to make cooperative policy learning easier.

"We propose a simple model selection approach for algorithms in stochastic bandit and reinforcement learning problems. As opposed to prior work that (implicitly) assumes knowledge of the optimal regret, we only require that each base algorithm comes with a candidate regret bound that may or may not hold during all rounds. In each round, our approach plays a base algorithm to keep the candidate regret bounds of all remaining base algorithms balanced, and eliminates algorithms that violate their candidate bound. We prove that the total regret of this approach is bounded by the best valid candidate regret bound times a multiplicative factor. This factor is reasonably small in several applications, including linear bandits and MDPs with nested function classes, linear bandits with unknown misspecification, and LinUCB applied to linear bandits with different confidence parameters. We further show that, under a suitable gap-assumption, this factor only scales with the number of base algorithms and not their complexity when the number of rounds is large enough. Finally, unlike recent efforts in model selection for linear stochastic bandits, our approach is versatile enough to also cover cases where the context information is generated by an adversarial environment, rather than a stochastic one.",0

"We consider the problem of finding optimal policies for a Markov Decision Process with almost sure constraints on state transitions and action triplets. We define value and action-value functions that satisfy a barrier-based decomposition which allows for the identification of feasible policies independently of the reward process. We prove that, given a policy {\pi}, certifying whether certain state-action pairs lead to feasible trajectories under {\pi} is equivalent to solving an auxiliary problem aimed at finding the probability of performing an unfeasible transition. Using this interpretation,we develop a Barrier-learning algorithm, based on Q-Learning, that identifies such unsafe state-action pairs. Our analysis motivates the need to enhance the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework with an additional signal, besides rewards, called here damage function that provides feasibility information and enables the solution of RL problems with model-free constraints. Moreover, our Barrier-learning algorithm wraps around existing RL algorithms, such as Q-Learning and SARSA, giving them the ability to solve almost-surely constrained problems.",0

"This paper gives a detailed review of reinforcement learning in combinatorial optimization, introduces the history of combinatorial optimization starting in the 1960s, and compares it with the reinforcement learning algorithms in recent years. We explicitly look at a famous combinatorial problem known as the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). We compare the approach of the modern reinforcement learning algorithms on TSP with an approach published in 1970. Then, we discuss the similarities between these algorithms and how the approach of reinforcement learning changes due to the evolution of machine learning techniques and computing power. We also mention the deep learning approach on the TSP, which is named Deep Reinforcement Learning. We argue that deep learning is a generic approach that can be integrated with traditional reinforcement learning algorithms and optimize the outcomes of the TSP.",0

"This paper introduces four new algorithms that can be used for tackling multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems occurring in cooperative settings. All algorithms are based on the Deep Quality-Value (DQV) family of algorithms, a set of techniques that have proven to be successful when dealing with single-agent reinforcement learning problems (SARL). The key idea of DQV algorithms is to jointly learn an approximation of the state-value function $V$, alongside an approximation of the state-action value function $Q$. We follow this principle and generalise these algorithms by introducing two fully decentralised MARL algorithms (IQV and IQV-Max) and two algorithms that are based on the centralised training with decentralised execution training paradigm (QVMix and QVMix-Max). We compare our algorithms with state-of-the-art MARL techniques on the popular StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment. We show competitive results when QVMix and QVMix-Max are compared to well-known MARL techniques such as QMIX and MAVEN and show that QVMix can even outperform them on some of the tested environments, being the algorithm which performs best overall. We hypothesise that this is due to the fact that QVMix suffers less from the overestimation bias of the $Q$ function.",0

"Self-imitation learning is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) method that encourages actions whose returns were higher than expected, which helps in hard exploration and sparse reward problems. It was shown to improve the performance of on-policy actor-critic methods in several discrete control tasks. Nevertheless, applying self-imitation to the mostly action-value based off-policy RL methods is not straightforward. We propose SAIL, a novel generalization of self-imitation learning for off-policy RL, based on a modification of the Bellman optimality operator that we connect to Advantage Learning. Crucially, our method mitigates the problem of stale returns by choosing the most optimistic return estimate between the observed return and the current action-value for self-imitation. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of SAIL on the Arcade Learning Environment, with a focus on hard exploration games.",0

"This paper presents the first model extraction attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which enables an external adversary to precisely recover a black-box DRL model only from its interaction with the environment. Model extraction attacks against supervised Deep Learning models have been widely studied. However, those techniques cannot be applied to the reinforcement learning scenario due to DRL models' high complexity, stochasticity and limited observable information. We propose a novel methodology to overcome the above challenges. The key insight of our approach is that the process of DRL model extraction is equivalent to imitation learning, a well-established solution to learn sequential decision-making policies. Based on this observation, our methodology first builds a classifier to reveal the training algorithm family of the targeted black-box DRL model only based on its predicted actions, and then leverages state-of-the-art imitation learning techniques to replicate the model from the identified algorithm family. Experimental results indicate that our methodology can effectively recover the DRL models with high fidelity and accuracy. We also demonstrate two use cases to show that our model extraction attack can (1) significantly improve the success rate of adversarial attacks, and (2) steal DRL models stealthily even they are protected by DNN watermarks. These pose a severe threat to the intellectual property and privacy protection of DRL applications.",0

"Generating useful network summaries is a challenging and important problem with several applications like sensemaking, visualization, and compression. However, most of the current work in this space do not take human feedback into account while generating summaries. Consider an intelligence analysis scenario, where the analyst is exploring a similarity network between documents. The analyst can express her agreement/disagreement with the visualization of the network summary via iterative feedback, e.g. closing or moving documents (""nodes"") together.

"While deep learning and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated impressive results in domains such as image classification, game playing, and robotic control, data efficiency remains a major challenge. Multi-task learning has emerged as a promising approach for sharing structure across multiple tasks to enable more efficient learning. However, the multi-task setting presents a number of optimization challenges, making it difficult to realize large efficiency gains compared to learning tasks independently. The reasons why multi-task learning is so challenging compared to single-task learning are not fully understood. In this work, we identify a set of three conditions of the multi-task optimization landscape that cause detrimental gradient interference, and develop a simple yet general approach for avoiding such interference between task gradients. We propose a form of gradient surgery that projects a task's gradient onto the normal plane of the gradient of any other task that has a conflicting gradient. On a series of challenging multi-task supervised and multi-task RL problems, this approach leads to substantial gains in efficiency and performance. Further, it is model-agnostic and can be combined with previously-proposed multi-task architectures for enhanced performance.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to significantly improve clinical decision making. However, treatment policies learned via RL from observational data are sensitive to subtle choices in study design. We highlight a simple approach, trajectory inspection, to bring clinicians into an iterative design process for model-based RL studies. We identify where the model recommends unexpectedly aggressive treatments or expects surprisingly positive outcomes from its recommendations. Then, we examine clinical trajectories simulated with the learned model and policy alongside the actual hospital course. Applying this approach to recent work on RL for sepsis management, we uncover a model bias towards discharge, a preference for high vasopressor doses that may be linked to small sample sizes, and clinically implausible expectations of discharge without weaning off vasopressors. We hope that iterations of detecting and addressing the issues unearthed by our method will result in RL policies that inspire more confidence in deployment.",0

"Users can be supported to adopt healthy behaviors, such as regular physical activity, via relevant and timely suggestions on their mobile devices. Recently, reinforcement learning algorithms have been found to be effective for learning the optimal context under which to provide suggestions. However, these algorithms are not necessarily designed for the constraints posed by mobile health (mHealth) settings, that they be efficient, domain-informed and computationally affordable. We propose an algorithm for providing physical activity suggestions in mHealth settings. Using domain-science, we formulate a contextual bandit algorithm which makes use of a linear mixed effects model. We then introduce a procedure to efficiently perform hyper-parameter updating, using far less computational resources than competing approaches. Not only is our approach computationally efficient, it is also easily implemented with closed form matrix algebraic updates and we show improvements over state of the art approaches both in speed and accuracy of up to 99% and 56% respectively.",0

"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) refers to the problem of learning policies from a static dataset of environment interactions. Offline RL enables extensive use and re-use of historical datasets, while also alleviating safety concerns associated with online exploration, thereby expanding the real-world applicability of RL. Most prior work in offline RL has focused on tasks with compact state representations. However, the ability to learn directly from rich observation spaces like images is critical for real-world applications such as robotics. In this work, we build on recent advances in model-based algorithms for offline RL, and extend them to high-dimensional visual observation spaces. Model-based offline RL algorithms have achieved state of the art results in state based tasks and have strong theoretical guarantees. However, they rely crucially on the ability to quantify uncertainty in the model predictions, which is particularly challenging with image observations. To overcome this challenge, we propose to learn a latent-state dynamics model, and represent the uncertainty in the latent space. Our approach is both tractable in practice and corresponds to maximizing a lower bound of the ELBO in the unknown POMDP. In experiments on a range of challenging image-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous offline model-free RL methods as well as state-of-the-art online visual model-based RL methods. Moreover, we also find that our approach excels on an image-based drawer closing task on a real robot using a pre-existing dataset.

"We propose a generic reward shaping approach for improving the rate of convergence in reinforcement learning (RL), called Self Improvement Based REwards, or SIBRE. The approach is designed for use in conjunction with any existing RL algorithm, and consists of rewarding improvement over the agent's own past performance. We prove that SIBRE converges in expectation under the same conditions as the original RL algorithm. The reshaped rewards help discriminate between policies when the original rewards are weakly discriminated or sparse. Experiments on several well-known benchmark environments with different RL algorithms show that SIBRE converges to the optimal policy faster and more stably.

"Frequency control is an important problem in modern recommender systems. It dictates the delivery frequency of recommendations to maintain product quality and efficiency. For example, the frequency of delivering promotional notifications impacts daily metrics as well as the infrastructure resource consumption (e.g. CPU and memory usage). There remain open questions on what objective we should optimize to represent business values in the long term best, and how we should balance between daily metrics and resource consumption in a dynamically fluctuating environment. We propose a personalized methodology for the frequency control problem, which combines long-term value optimization using reinforcement learning (RL) with a robust volume control technique we termed ""Effective Factor"". We demonstrate statistically significant improvement in daily metrics and resource efficiency by our method in several notification applications at a scale of billions of users.

"Since the publication of the original Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017), Transformers revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing. This, mainly due to their ability to understand timely dependencies better than competing RNN-based architectures. Surprisingly, this architecture change does not affect the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), even though RNNs are quite popular in RL, and time dependencies are very common in RL.

"The reinforcement learning (RL) framework formalizes the notion of learning with interactions. Many real-world problems have large state-spaces and/or action-spaces such as in Go, StarCraft, protein folding, and robotics or are non-Markovian, which cause significant challenges to RL algorithms. In this work we address the large action-space problem by sequentializing actions, which can reduce the action-space size significantly, even down to two actions at the expense of an increased planning horizon. We provide explicit and exact constructions and equivalence proofs for all quantities of interest for arbitrary history-based processes. In the case of MDPs, this could help RL algorithms that bootstrap. In this work we show how action-binarization in the non-MDP case can significantly improve Extreme State Aggregation (ESA) bounds. ESA allows casting any (non-MDP, non-ergodic, history-based) RL problem into a fixed-sized non-Markovian state-space with the help of a surrogate Markovian process. On the upside, ESA enjoys similar optimality guarantees as Markovian models do. But a downside is that the size of the aggregated state-space becomes exponential in the size of the action-space. In this work, we patch this issue by binarizing the action-space. We provide an upper bound on the number of states of this binarized ESA that is logarithmic in the original action-space size, a double-exponential improvement.",0

"Learning complicated value functions in high dimensional state space by function approximation is a challenging task, partially due to that the max-operator used in temporal difference updates can theoretically cause instability for most linear or non-linear approximation schemes. Mellowmax is a recently proposed differentiable and non-expansion softmax operator that allows a convergent behavior in learning and planning. Unfortunately, the performance bound for the fixed point it converges to remains unclear, and in practice, its parameter is sensitive to various domains and has to be tuned case by case. Finally, the Mellowmax operator may suffer from oversmoothing as it ignores the probability being taken for each action when aggregating them. In this paper, we address all the above issues with an enhanced Mellowmax operator, named SM2 (Soft Mellowmax). Particularly, the proposed operator is reliable, easy to implement, and has provable performance guarantee, while preserving all the advantages of Mellowmax. Furthermore, we show that our SM2 operator can be applied to the challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios, leading to stable value function approximation and state of the art performance.",0

However, accurate orifice localization is hard because of the high anatomic variation of LAA, and unclear position and orientation of the orifice in available CT views. Deep localization models also yield high error in localizing the orifice in CT image because of the tiny structure of orifice compared to the vastness of CT image. In this paper, we propose a centerline depth-based reinforcement learning (RL) world for effective orifice localization in a small search space. In our scheme, an RL agent observes the centerline-to-surface distance and navigates through the LAA centerline to localize the orifice. Thus, the search space is significantly reduced facilitating improved localization. The proposed formulation could result in high localization accuracy comparing to the expert-annotations in 98 CT images. Moreover, the localization process takes about 8 seconds which is 18 times more efficient than the existing method. Therefore, this can be a useful aid to physicians during the preprocedural planning of LAAC.",0

"Many real-world sequential decision-making problems involve critical systems with financial risks and human-life risks. While several works in the past have proposed methods that are safe for deployment, they assume that the underlying problem is stationary. However, many real-world problems of interest exhibit non-stationarity, and when stakes are high, the cost associated with a false stationarity assumption may be unacceptable. We take the first steps towards ensuring safety, with high confidence, for smoothly-varying non-stationary decision problems. Our proposed method extends a type of safe algorithm, called a Seldonian algorithm, through a synthesis of model-free reinforcement learning with time-series analysis. Safety is ensured using sequential hypothesis testing of a policy's forecasted performance, and confidence intervals are obtained using wild bootstrap.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is computationally demanding and requires processing of many data points. Synchronous methods enjoy training stability while having lower data throughput. In contrast, asynchronous methods achieve high throughput but suffer from stability issues and lower sample efficiency due to `stale policies.' To combine the advantages of both methods we propose High-Throughput Synchronous Deep Reinforcement Learning (HTS-RL). In HTS-RL, we perform learning and rollouts concurrently, devise a system design which avoids `stale policies' and ensure that actors interact with environment replicas in an asynchronous manner while maintaining full determinism. We evaluate our approach on Atari games and the Google Research Football environment. Compared to synchronous baselines, HTS-RL is 2-6$\times$ faster. Compared to state-of-the-art asynchronous methods, HTS-RL has competitive throughput and consistently achieves higher average episode rewards.",0

"We study the task of embodied visual active learning, where an agent is set to explore a 3d environment with the goal to acquire visual scene understanding by actively selecting views for which to request annotation. While accurate on some benchmarks, today's deep visual recognition pipelines tend to not generalize well in certain real-world scenarios, or for unusual viewpoints. Robotic perception, in turn, requires the capability to refine the recognition capabilities for the conditions where the mobile system operates, including cluttered indoor environments or poor illumination. This motivates the proposed task, where an agent is placed in a novel environment with the objective of improving its visual recognition capability. To study embodied visual active learning, we develop a battery of agents - both learnt and pre-specified - and with different levels of knowledge of the environment. The agents are equipped with a semantic segmentation network and seek to acquire informative views, move and explore in order to propagate annotations in the neighbourhood of those views, then refine the underlying segmentation network by online retraining. The trainable method uses deep reinforcement learning with a reward function that balances two competing objectives: task performance, represented as visual recognition accuracy, which requires exploring the environment, and the necessary amount of annotated data requested during active exploration. We extensively evaluate the proposed models using the photorealistic Matterport3D simulator and show that a fully learnt method outperforms comparable pre-specified counterparts, even when requesting fewer annotations.",0

"Neural networks can achieve excellent results in a wide variety of applications. However, when they attempt to sequentially learn, they tend to learn the new task while catastrophically forgetting previous ones. We propose a model that overcomes catastrophic forgetting in sequential reinforcement learning by combining ideas from continual learning in both the image classification domain and the reinforcement learning domain. This model features a dual memory system which separates continual learning from reinforcement learning and a pseudo-rehearsal system that ""recalls"" items representative of previous tasks via a deep generative network. Our model sequentially learns Atari 2600 games without demonstrating catastrophic forgetting and continues to perform above human level on all three games.

We propose BCD4Rec: Batch-Constrained Distributional RL for Session-based Recommendations. BCD4Rec builds upon the recent advances in batch (offline) RL and distributional RL to learn from offline logs while dealing with the intrinsically stochastic nature of rewards from the users due to varied latent interest preferences (environments). We demonstrate that BCD4Rec significantly improves upon the behavior policy as well as strong RL and non-RL baselines in the batch setting in terms of standard performance metrics like Click Through Rates or Buy Rates.

"Recent progress on physics-based character animation has shown impressive breakthroughs on human motion synthesis, through imitating motion capture data via deep reinforcement learning. However, results have mostly been demonstrated on imitating a single distinct motion pattern, and do not generalize to interactive tasks that require flexible motion patterns due to varying human-object spatial configurations. To bridge this gap, we focus on one class of interactive tasks -- sitting onto a chair.

"Learning to produce efficient movement behaviour for humanoid robots from scratch is a hard problem, as has been illustrated by the ""Learning to run"" competition at NIPS 2017. The goal of this competition was to train a two-legged model of a humanoid body to run in a simulated race course with maximum speed. All submissions took a tabula rasa approach to reinforcement learning (RL) and were able to produce relatively fast, but not optimal running behaviour. In this paper, we demonstrate how data from videos of human running (e.g. taken from YouTube) can be used to shape the reward of the humanoid learning agent to speed up the learning and produce a better result. Specifically, we are using the positions of key body parts at regular time intervals to define a potential function for potential-based reward shaping (PBRS). Since PBRS does not change the optimal policy, this approach allows the RL agent to overcome sub-optimalities in the human movements that are shown in the videos.   We present experiments in which we combine selected techniques from the top ten approaches from the NIPS competition with further optimizations to create an high-performing agent as a baseline. We then demonstrate how video-based reward shaping improves the performance further, resulting in an RL agent that runs twice as fast as the baseline in 12 hours of training.

"Context, the embedding of previous collected trajectories, is a powerful construct for Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) algorithms. By conditioning on an effective context, Meta-RL policies can easily generalize to new tasks within a few adaptation steps.

How to train a compact and sufficient encoder that can embed the task-specific information contained in prior trajectories? 2. How to collect informative trajectories of which the corresponding context reflects the specification of tasks? To this end, we propose a novel Meta-RL framework called CCM (Contrastive learning augmented Context-based Meta-RL).

We utilize the contrastive nature of different tasks to train a compact and effective context encoder, and we also train a separate exploration policy. Additionally, we derive a new objective based on information gain to collect informative trajectories in a few steps. Through experiments on various benchmarks, including complex sparse-reward environments, we show that CCM outperforms existing algorithms by addressing the aforementioned challenges.",1
"Success stories of applied machine learning can be traced back to the datasets and environments that were put forward as challenges for the community. The challenge that the community sets as a benchmark is usually the challenge that the community eventually solves. The ultimate challenge of reinforcement learning research is to train real agents to operate in the real environment, but until now there has not been a common real-world RL benchmark. In this work, we present a prototype real-world environment from OffWorld Gym -- a collection of real-world environments for reinforcement learning in robotics with free public remote access. Close integration into existing ecosystem allows the community to start using OffWorld Gym without any prior experience in robotics and takes away the burden of managing a physical robotics system, abstracting it under a familiar API. We introduce a navigation task, where a robot has to reach a visual beacon on an uneven terrain using only the camera input and provide baseline results in both the real environment and the simulated replica.

"We present a machine learning framework and a new test bed for data mining from the Slurm Workload Manager for high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. The focus was to find a method for selecting features to support decisions: helping users decide whether to resubmit failed jobs with boosted CPU and memory allocations or migrate them to a computing cloud. This task was cast as both supervised classification and regression learning, specifically, sequential problem solving suitable for reinforcement learning. Selecting relevant features can improve training accuracy, reduce training time, and produce a more comprehensible model, with an intelligent system that can explain predictions and inferences. We present a supervised learning model trained on a Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (Slurm) data set of HPC jobs using three different techniques for selecting features: linear regression, lasso, and ridge regression. Our data set represented both HPC jobs that failed and those that succeeded, so our model was reliable, less likely to overfit, and generalizable. Our model achieved an R^2 of 95\% with 99\% accuracy. We identified five predictors for both CPU and memory properties.",0

"A characteristic of reinforcement learning is the ability to develop unforeseen strategies when solving problems. While such strategies sometimes yield superior performance, they may also result in undesired or even dangerous behavior. In industrial scenarios, a system's behavior also needs to be predictable and lie within defined ranges. To enable the agents to learn (how) to align with a given specification, this paper proposes to explicitly transfer functional and non-functional requirements into shaped rewards. Experiments are carried out on the smart factory, a multi-agent environment modeling an industrial lot-size-one production facility, with up to eight agents and different multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Results indicate that compliance with functional and non-functional constraints can be achieved by the proposed approach.",0

"In this work, we study vision-based end-to-end reinforcement learning on vehicle control problems, such as lane following and collision avoidance. Our controller policy is able to control a small-scale robot to follow the right-hand lane of a real two-lane road, while its training was solely carried out in a simulation. Our model, realized by a simple, convolutional network, only relies on images of a forward-facing monocular camera and generates continuous actions that directly control the vehicle. To train this policy we used Proximal Policy Optimization, and to achieve the generalization capability required for real performance we used domain randomization. We carried out thorough analysis of the trained policy, by measuring multiple performance metrics and comparing these to baselines that rely on other methods. To assess the quality of the simulation-to-reality transfer learning process and the performance of the controller in the real world, we measured simple metrics on a real track and compared these with results from a matching simulation. Further analysis was carried out by visualizing salient object maps.",0

"Reinforcement Learning offers tools to optimize policies based on the data obtained from the real system subject to the policy. While the potential of Reinforcement Learning is well understood, many critical aspects still need to be tackled. One crucial aspect is the issue of safety and stability. Recent publications suggest the use of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control techniques in combination with Reinforcement Learning as a viable and theoretically justified approach to tackle these problems. In particular, it has been suggested that robust MPC allows for making formal stability and safety claims in the context of Reinforcement Learning. However, a formal theory detailing how safety and stability can be enforced through the parameter updates delivered by the Reinforcement Learning tools is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap. The theory is developed for the generic robust MPC case, and further detailed in the robust tube-based linear MPC case, where the theory is fairly easy to deploy in practice.",0

"Deep Q Network (DQN) is a very successful algorithm, yet the inherent problem of reinforcement learning, i.e. the exploit-explore balance, remains. In this work, we introduce entropy regularization into DQN and propose SQN. We find that the backup equation of soft Q learning can enjoy the corrective feedback if we view the soft backup as policy improvement in the form of Q, instead of policy evaluation. We show that Soft Q Learning with Corrective Feedback (SQL-CF) underlies the on-plicy nature of SQL and the equivalence of SQL and Soft Policy Gradient (SPG). With these insights, we propose an on-policy version of deep Q learning algorithm, i.e. Q On-Policy (QOP). We experiment with QOP on a self-play environment called Google Research Football (GRF). The QOP algorithm exhibits great stability and efficiency in training GRF agents.",0

"Despite the increasing interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in multiple communities, understanding its theoretical foundation has long been recognized as a challenging problem. In this work, we address this problem by providing a finite-sample analysis for decentralized batch MARL with networked agents. Specifically, we consider two decentralized MARL settings, where teams of agents are connected by time-varying communication networks, and either collaborate or compete in a zero-sum game setting, without any central controller. These settings cover many conventional MARL settings in the literature. For both settings, we develop batch MARL algorithms that can be implemented in a decentralized fashion, and quantify the finite-sample errors of the estimated action-value functions. Our error analysis captures how the function class, the number of samples within each iteration, and the number of iterations determine the statistical accuracy of the proposed algorithms. Our results, compared to the finite-sample bounds for single-agent RL, involve additional error terms caused by decentralized computation, which is inherent in our decentralized MARL setting. This work appears to be the first finite-sample analysis for batch MARL, a step towards rigorous theoretical understanding of general MARL algorithms in the finite-sample regime.",0

"In large-scale problems, standard reinforcement learning algorithms suffer from slow learning speed. In this paper, we follow the framework of using subspaces to tackle this problem. We propose a free-energy minimization framework for selecting the subspaces and integrate the policy of the state-space into the subspaces. Our proposed free-energy minimization framework rests upon Thompson sampling policy and behavioral policy of subspaces and the state-space. It is therefore applicable to a variety of tasks, discrete or continuous state space, model-free and model-based tasks.

"A Hilbert space embedding of a distribution---in short, a kernel mean embedding---has recently emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning and inference. The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel methods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a generalization of the original ""feature map"" common to support vector machines (SVMs) and other kernel methods. While initially closely associated with the latter, it has meanwhile found application in fields ranging from kernel machines and probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery, and deep learning. The goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of existing work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss the most challenging issues and open problems that could lead to new research directions. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and positive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by a thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions, theoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of distributions enables us to apply RKHS methods to probability measures which prompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing, independent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the Hilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical insights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables us to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous in graphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in a non-parametric way. We then discuss relationships between this framework and other related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research directions.",0

"In mobile health (mHealth) smart devices deliver behavioral treatments repeatedly over time to a user with the goal of helping the user adopt and maintain healthy behaviors. Reinforcement learning appears ideal for learning how to optimally make these sequential treatment decisions. However, significant challenges must be overcome before reinforcement learning can be effectively deployed in a mobile healthcare setting. In this work we are concerned with the following challenges: 1) individuals who are in the same context can exhibit differential response to treatments 2) only a limited amount of data is available for learning on any one individual, and 3) non-stationary responses to treatment. To address these challenges we generalize Thompson-Sampling bandit algorithms to develop IntelligentPooling. IntelligentPooling learns personalized treatment policies thus addressing challenge one. To address the second challenge, IntelligentPooling updates each user's degree of personalization while making use of available data on other users to speed up learning. Lastly, IntelligentPooling allows responsivity to vary as a function of a user's time since beginning treatment, thus addressing challenge three. We show that IntelligentPooling achieves an average of 26% lower regret than state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the promise of this approach and its ability to learn from even a small group of users in a live clinical trial.",0

"In offline reinforcement learning (RL) agents are trained using a logged dataset. It appears to be the most natural route to attack real-life applications because in domains such as healthcare and robotics interactions with the environment are either expensive or unethical. Training agents usually requires reward functions, but unfortunately, rewards are seldom available in practice and their engineering is challenging and laborious. To overcome this, we investigate reward learning under the constraint of minimizing human reward annotations. We consider two types of supervision: timestep annotations and demonstrations. We propose semi-supervised learning algorithms that learn from limited annotations and incorporate unlabelled data. In our experiments with a simulated robotic arm, we greatly improve upon behavioural cloning and closely approach the performance achieved with ground truth rewards. We further investigate the relationship between the quality of the reward model and the final policies. We notice, for example, that the reward models do not need to be perfect to result in useful policies.",0

"Molecule optimization is a fundamental task for accelerating drug discovery, with the goal of generating new valid molecules that maximize multiple drug properties while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. Existing generative models and reinforcement learning approaches made initial success, but still face difficulties in simultaneously optimizing multiple drug properties. To address such challenges, we propose the MultI-constraint MOlecule SAmpling (MIMOSA) approach, a sampling framework to use input molecule as an initial guess and sample molecules from the target distribution. MIMOSA first pretrains two property agnostic graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecule topology and substructure-type prediction, where a substructure can be either atom or single ring. For each iteration, MIMOSA uses the GNNs' prediction and employs three basic substructure operations (add, replace, delete) to generate new molecules and associated weights. The weights can encode multiple constraints including similarity and drug property constraints, upon which we select promising molecules for next iteration. MIMOSA enables flexible encoding of multiple property- and similarity-constraints and can efficiently generate new molecules that satisfy various property constraints and achieved up to 49.6% relative improvement over the best baseline in terms of success rate.",0

"Actor-critic methods, a type of model-free reinforcement learning (RL), have achieved state-of-the-art performances in many real-world domains in continuous control. Despite their success, the wide-scale deployment of these models is still a far cry. The main problems in these actor-critic methods are inefficient exploration and sub-optimal policies. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), two cutting edge such algorithms, suffer from these issues. SAC effectively addressed the problems of sample complexity and convergence brittleness to hyper-parameters and thus outperformed all state-of-the-art algorithms including TD3 in harder tasks, whereas TD3 produced moderate results in all environments. SAC suffers from inefficient exploration owing to the Gaussian nature of its policy which causes borderline performance in simpler tasks. In this paper, we introduce Opportunistic Actor-Critic (OPAC), a novel model-free deep RL algorithm that employs better exploration policy and lesser variance. OPAC combines some of the most powerful features of TD3 and SAC and aims to optimize a stochastic policy in an off-policy way. For calculating the target Q-values, instead of two critics, OPAC uses three critics and based on the environment complexity, opportunistically chooses how the target Q-value is computed from the critics' evaluation. We have systematically evaluated the algorithm on MuJoCo environments where it achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms or at least equals the performance of TD3 and SAC.",0

"Embedded systems have proliferated in various consumer and industrial applications with the evolution of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things. These systems are subjected to stringent constraints so that embedded software must be optimized for multiple objectives simultaneously, namely reduced energy consumption, execution time, and code size. Compilers offer optimization phases to improve these metrics. However, proper selection and ordering of them depends on multiple factors and typically requires expert knowledge. State-of-the-art optimizers facilitate different platforms and applications case by case, and they are limited by optimizing one metric at a time, as well as requiring a time-consuming adaptation for different targets through dynamic profiling.   To address these problems, we propose the novel MLComp methodology, in which optimization phases are sequenced by a Reinforcement Learning-based policy. Training of the policy is supported by Machine Learning-based analytical models for quick performance estimation, thereby drastically reducing the time spent for dynamic profiling. In our framework, different Machine Learning models are automatically tested to choose the best-fitting one. The trained Performance Estimator model is leveraged to efficiently devise Reinforcement Learning-based multi-objective policies for creating quasi-optimal phase sequences.

"This paper discusses an Enhanced Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (E-MAML) algorithm that generates fast convergence of the policy function from a small number of training examples when applied to new learning tasks.

We apply E-MAML to developing reinforcement learning (RL)-based online fault tolerant control schemes for dynamic systems. The enhancement is applied when a new fault occurs, to re-initialize the parameters of a new RL policy that achieves faster adaption with a small number of samples of system behavior with the new fault. This replaces the random task sampling step in MAML. Instead, it exploits the extant previously generated experiences of the controller. The enhancement is sampled to maximally span the parameter space to facilitate adaption to the new fault.

"In a wide variety of sequential decision making problems, it can be important to estimate the impact of rare events in order to minimize risk exposure. A popular risk measure is the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), which is commonly estimated by averaging observations that occur beyond a quantile at a given confidence level. When this confidence level is very high, this estimation method can exhibit high variance due to the limited number of samples above the corresponding quantile. To mitigate this problem, extreme value theory can be used to derive an estimator for the CVaR that uses extrapolation beyond available samples. This estimator requires the selection of a threshold parameter to work well, which is a difficult challenge that has been widely studied in the extreme value theory literature. In this paper, we present an estimation procedure for the CVaR that combines extreme value theory and a recently introduced method of automated threshold selection by \cite{bader2018automated}. Under appropriate conditions, we estimate the tail risk using a generalized Pareto distribution. We compare empirically this estimation procedure with the commonly used method of sample averaging, and show an improvement in performance for some distributions. We finally show how the estimation procedure can be used in reinforcement learning by applying our method to the multi-arm bandit problem where the goal is to avoid catastrophic risk.",0
"In certain situations where decisions are made sequentially, it is important to assess the impact of infrequent events to minimize exposure to risk. The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is a well-known measure of risk, often estimated by averaging observations beyond a predetermined quantile at a specific confidence level. However, when the confidence level is very high, this estimation method may have high variance due to the limited number of samples beyond the corresponding quantile. To address this issue, extreme value theory can be applied to create an estimator for the CVaR that extrapolates beyond the available data. This method requires choosing a threshold parameter, which has been a challenging task extensively studied in extreme value theory literature. In this paper, we propose an estimation procedure for the CVaR that combines extreme value theory with an automated threshold selection method introduced by Bader (2018). Under appropriate conditions, we use a generalized Pareto distribution to estimate tail risk. We compare our approach to the commonly used sample averaging method and show improved performance for some distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how our estimation procedure can be applied to reinforcement learning by addressing the multi-arm bandit problem to avoid catastrophic risk.",1
"Language creates a compact representation of the world and allows the description of unlimited situations and objectives through compositionality. While these characterizations may foster instructing, conditioning or structuring interactive agent behavior, it remains an open-problem to correctly relate language understanding and reinforcement learning in even simple instruction following scenarios. This joint learning problem is alleviated through expert demonstrations, auxiliary losses, or neural inductive biases. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal approach called Hindsight Generation for Experience Replay (HIGhER) that extends the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) approach to the language-conditioned policy setting. Whenever the agent does not fulfill its instruction, HIGhER learns to output a new directive that matches the agent trajectory, and it relabels the episode with a positive reward. To do so, HIGhER learns to map a state into an instruction by using past successful trajectories, which removes the need to have external expert interventions to relabel episodes as in vanilla HER. We show the efficiency of our approach in the BabyAI environment, and demonstrate how it complements other instruction following methods.",0
"The use of language enables a concise representation of the world and enables the description of countless situations and objectives through compositionality. While this can aid in instructing, conditioning, or structuring the behavior of interactive agents, effectively connecting language understanding and reinforcement learning in even simple instruction-following scenarios remains a challenge. To address this, expert demonstrations, auxiliary losses, or neural inductive biases are often employed. This paper introduces an alternative solution called Hindsight Generation for Experience Replay (HIGhER), which builds on the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) method for language-conditioned policy settings. HIGhER learns to generate new directives that match the agent's path when it fails to follow the given instruction, and rewards the episode accordingly. It achieves this by mapping a state to an instruction using past successful trajectories, eliminating the need for external expert guidance. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated in the BabyAI environment, and its potential to complement other instruction-following methods is highlighted.",1
"Exploration is essential for reinforcement learning (RL). To face the challenges of exploration, we consider a reward-free RL framework that completely separates exploration from exploitation and brings new challenges for exploration algorithms. In the exploration phase, the agent learns an exploratory policy by interacting with a reward-free environment and collects a dataset of transitions by executing the policy. In the planning phase, the agent computes a good policy for any reward function based on the dataset without further interacting with the environment. This framework is suitable for the meta RL setting where there are many reward functions of interest. In the exploration phase, we propose to maximize the Renyi entropy over the state-action space and justify this objective theoretically. The success of using Renyi entropy as the objective results from its encouragement to explore the hard-to-reach state-actions. We further deduce a policy gradient formulation for this objective and design a practical exploration algorithm that can deal with complex environments. In the planning phase, we solve for good policies given arbitrary reward functions using a batch RL algorithm. Empirically, we show that our exploration algorithm is effective and sample efficient, and results in superior policies for arbitrary reward functions in the planning phase.",0

"Transfer reinforcement learning (RL) aims at improving the learning efficiency of an agent by exploiting knowledge from other source agents trained on relevant tasks. However, it remains challenging to transfer knowledge between different environmental dynamics without having access to the source environments. In this work, we explore a new challenge in transfer RL, where only a set of source policies collected under diverse unknown dynamics is available for learning a target task efficiently. To address this problem, the proposed approach, MULTI-source POLicy AggRegation (MULTIPOLAR), comprises two key techniques. We learn to aggregate the actions provided by the source policies adaptively to maximize the target task performance. Meanwhile, we learn an auxiliary network that predicts residuals around the aggregated actions, which ensures the target policy's expressiveness even when some of the source policies perform poorly. We demonstrated the effectiveness of MULTIPOLAR through an extensive experimental evaluation across six simulated environments ranging from classic control problems to challenging robotics simulations, under both continuous and discrete action spaces. The demo videos and code are available on the project webpage: https://omron-sinicx.github.io/multipolar/.",0

Safety validation is important during the development of safety-critical autonomous systems but can require significant computational effort. Existing algorithms often start from scratch each time the system under test changes. We apply transfer learning to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning based safety validation algorithms when applied to related systems. Knowledge from previous safety validation tasks is encoded through the action value function and transferred to future tasks with a learned set of attention weights. Including a learned state and action value transformation for each source task can improve performance even when systems have substantially different failure modes. We conduct experiments on safety validation tasks in gridworld and autonomous driving scenarios. We show that transfer learning can improve the initial and final performance of validation algorithms and reduce the number of training steps.,0

"Linear fixed point equations in Hilbert spaces arise in a variety of settings, including reinforcement learning, and computational methods for solving differential and integral equations. We study methods that use a collection of random observations to compute approximate solutions by searching over a known low-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space. First, we prove an instance-dependent upper bound on the mean-squared error for a linear stochastic approximation scheme that exploits Polyak--Ruppert averaging. This bound consists of two terms: an approximation error term with an instance-dependent approximation factor, and a statistical error term that captures the instance-specific complexity of the noise when projected onto the low-dimensional subspace. Using information theoretic methods, we also establish lower bounds showing that both of these terms cannot be improved, again in an instance-dependent sense. A concrete consequence of our characterization is that the optimal approximation factor in this problem can be much larger than a universal constant. We show how our results precisely characterize the error of a class of temporal difference learning methods for the policy evaluation problem with linear function approximation, establishing their optimality.",0

"With the continuous development of machine learning technology, major e-commerce platforms have launched recommendation systems based on it to serve a large number of customers with different needs more efficiently. Compared with traditional supervised learning, reinforcement learning can better capture the user's state transition in the decision-making process, and consider a series of user actions, not just the static characteristics of the user at a certain moment. In theory, it will have a long-term perspective, producing a more effective recommendation. The special requirements of reinforcement learning for data make it need to rely on an offline virtual system for training. Our project mainly establishes a virtual user environment for offline training.

"There have been attempts in reinforcement learning to exploit a priori knowledge about the structure of the system. This paper proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning controller which dynamically interpolates a model-based linear controller and an arbitrary differentiable policy. The linear controller is designed based on local linearised model knowledge, and stabilises the system in a neighbourhood about an operating point. The coefficients of interpolation between the two controllers are determined by a scaled distance function measuring the distance between the current state and the operating point. The overall hybrid controller is proven to maintain the stability guarantee around the neighborhood of the operating point and still possess the universal function approximation property of the arbitrary non-linear policy. Learning has been done on both model-based (PILCO) and model-free (DDPG) frameworks. Simulation experiments performed in OpenAI gym demonstrate stability and robustness of the proposed hybrid controller. This paper thus introduces a principled method allowing for the direct importing of control methodology into reinforcement learning.",0

"Ramp metering that uses traffic signals to regulate vehicle flows from the on-ramps has been widely implemented to improve vehicle mobility of the freeway. Previous studies generally update signal timings in real-time based on predefined traffic measures collected by point detectors, such as traffic volumes and occupancies. Comparing with point detectors, traffic cameras-which have been increasingly deployed on road networks-could cover larger areas and provide more detailed traffic information. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to explore the potential of traffic video data in improving the efficiency of ramp metering. The proposed method uses traffic video frames as inputs and learns the optimal control strategies directly from the high-dimensional visual inputs. A real-world case study demonstrates that, in comparison with a state-of-the-practice method, the proposed DRL method results in 1) lower travel times in the mainline, 2) shorter vehicle queues at the on-ramp, and 3) higher traffic flows downstream of the merging area. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to extract useful information from the video data for better ramp metering controls.",0

"In reinforcement learning, domain randomisation is an increasingly popular technique for learning more general policies that are robust to domain-shifts at deployment. However, naively aggregating information from randomised domains may lead to high variance in gradient estimation and unstable learning process. To address this issue, we present a peer-to-peer online distillation strategy for RL termed P2PDRL, where multiple workers are each assigned to a different environment, and exchange knowledge through mutual regularisation based on Kullback-Leibler divergence.

"We propose a method for incorporating object interaction and human body dynamics into the task of 3D ego-pose estimation using a head-mounted camera. We use a kinematics model of the human body to represent the entire range of human motion, and a dynamics model of the body to interact with objects inside a physics simulator. By bringing together object modeling, kinematics modeling, and dynamics modeling in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we enable object-aware 3D ego-pose estimation. We devise several representational innovations through the design of the state and action space to incorporate 3D scene context and improve pose estimation quality. We also construct a fine-tuning step to correct the drift and refine the estimated human-object interaction. This is the first work to estimate a physically valid 3D full-body interaction sequence with objects (e.g., chairs, boxes, obstacles) from egocentric videos. Experiments with both controlled and in-the-wild settings show that our method can successfully extract an object-conditioned 3D ego-pose sequence that is consistent with the laws of physics.",0

"We consider the problem of learning a set of probability distributions from the empirical Bellman dynamics in distributional reinforcement learning (RL), a class of state-of-the-art methods that estimate the distribution, as opposed to only the expectation, of the total return. We formulate a method that learns a finite set of statistics from each return distribution via neural networks, as in (Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos 2017; Dabney et al. 2018b). Existing distributional RL methods however constrain the learned statistics to \emph{predefined} functional forms of the return distribution which is both restrictive in representation and difficult in maintaining the predefined statistics. Instead, we learn \emph{unrestricted} statistics, i.e., deterministic (pseudo-)samples, of the return distribution by leveraging a technique from hypothesis testing known as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which leads to a simpler objective amenable to backpropagation. Our method can be interpreted as implicitly matching all orders of moments between a return distribution and its Bellman target. We establish sufficient conditions for the contraction of the distributional Bellman operator and provide finite-sample analysis for the deterministic samples in distribution approximation. Experiments on the suite of Atari games show that our method outperforms the standard distributional RL baselines and sets a new record in the Atari games for non-distributed agents.",0

"Effective training of advanced ML models requires large amounts of labeled data, which is often scarce in scientific problems given the substantial human labor and material cost to collect labeled data. This poses a challenge on determining when and where we should deploy measuring instruments (e.g., in-situ sensors) to collect labeled data efficiently. This problem differs from traditional pool-based active learning settings in that the labeling decisions have to be made immediately after we observe the input data that come in a time series. In this paper, we develop a real-time active learning method that uses the spatial and temporal contextual information to select representative query samples in a reinforcement learning framework. To reduce the need for large training data, we further propose to transfer the policy learned from simulation data which is generated by existing physics-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by predicting streamflow and water temperature in the Delaware River Basin given a limited budget for collecting labeled data.

"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods have shown strong sample efficiency and performance across a variety of tasks, including when faced with high-dimensional visual observations. These methods learn to predict the environment dynamics and expected reward from interaction and use this predictive model to plan and perform the task. However, MBRL methods vary in their fundamental design choices, and there is no strong consensus in the literature on how these design decisions affect performance. In this paper, we study a number of design decisions for the predictive model in visual MBRL algorithms, focusing specifically on methods that use a predictive model for planning. We find that a range of design decisions that are often considered crucial, such as the use of latent spaces, have little effect on task performance. A big exception to this finding is that predicting future observations (i.e., images) leads to significant task performance improvement compared to only predicting rewards. We also empirically find that image prediction accuracy, somewhat surprisingly, correlates more strongly with downstream task performance than reward prediction accuracy. We show how this phenomenon is related to exploration and how some of the lower-scoring models on standard benchmarks (that require exploration) will perform the same as the best-performing models when trained on the same training data. Simultaneously, in the absence of exploration, models that fit the data better usually perform better on the downstream task as well, but surprisingly, these are often not the same models that perform the best when learning and exploring from scratch. These findings suggest that performance and exploration place important and potentially contradictory requirements on the model.",0

"Humans learn all their life long. They accumulate knowledge from a sequence of learning experiences and remember the essential concepts without forgetting what they have learned previously. Artificial neural networks struggle to learn similarly. They often rely on data rigorously preprocessed to learn solutions to specific problems such as classification or regression. In particular, they forget their past learning experiences if trained on new ones. Therefore, artificial neural networks are often inept to deal with real-life settings such as an autonomous-robot that has to learn on-line to adapt to new situations and overcome new problems without forgetting its past learning-experiences. Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning addressing this type of problem. Continual algorithms are designed to accumulate and improve knowledge in a curriculum of learning-experiences without forgetting. In this thesis, we propose to explore continual algorithms with replay processes. Replay processes gather together rehearsal methods and generative replay methods. Generative Replay consists of regenerating past learning experiences with a generative model to remember them. Rehearsal consists of saving a core-set of samples from past learning experiences to rehearse them later. The replay processes make possible a compromise between optimizing the current learning objective and the past ones enabling learning without forgetting in sequences of tasks settings. We show that they are very promising methods for continual learning. Notably, they enable the re-evaluation of past data with new knowledge and the confrontation of data from different learning-experiences. We demonstrate their ability to learn continually through unsupervised learning, supervised learning and reinforcement learning tasks.",0

"The generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) has provided an adversarial learning framework for imitating expert policy from demonstrations in high-dimensional continuous tasks. However, almost all GAIL and its extensions only design a kind of reward function of logarithmic form in the adversarial training strategy with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence for all complex environments. The fixed logarithmic type of reward function may be difficult to solve all complex tasks, and the vanishing gradients problem caused by the JS divergence will harm the adversarial learning process. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named Wasserstein Distance guided Adversarial Imitation Learning (WDAIL) for promoting the performance of imitation learning (IL). There are three improvements in our method: (a) introducing the Wasserstein distance to obtain more appropriate measure in the adversarial training process, (b) using proximal policy optimization (PPO) in the reinforcement learning stage which is much simpler to implement and makes the algorithm more efficient, and (c) exploring different reward function shapes to suit different tasks for improving the performance. The experiment results show that the learning procedure remains remarkably stable, and achieves significant performance in the complex continuous control tasks of MuJoCo.",0

"Deep Learning has become interestingly popular in computer vision, mostly attaining near or above human-level performance in various vision tasks. But recent work has also demonstrated that these deep neural networks are very vulnerable to adversarial examples (adversarial examples - inputs to a model which are naturally similar to original data but fools the model in classifying it into a wrong class). Humans are very robust against such perturbations; one possible reason could be that humans do not learn to classify based on an error between ""target label"" and ""predicted label"" but possibly due to reinforcements that they receive on their predictions. In this work, we proposed a novel method to train deep learning models on an image classification task. We used a reward-based optimization function, similar to the vanilla policy gradient method used in reinforcement learning, to train our model instead of conventional cross-entropy loss. An empirical evaluation on the cifar10 dataset showed that our method learns a more robust classifier than the same model architecture trained using cross-entropy loss function (on adversarial training). At the same time, our method shows a better generalization with the difference in test accuracy and train accuracy $< 2\%$ for most of the time compared to the cross-entropy one, whose difference most of the time remains $> 2\%$.",0
"Computer vision has seen a rise in popularity of Deep Learning due to its ability to perform as well as or surpass human-level performance in vision tasks. However, recent studies have revealed that these neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are inputs that appear similar to the original data but mislead the model into making incorrect classifications. Unlike humans, who are resistant to such disturbances, these models rely on discrepancies between predicted and target labels for classification. Our research proposes an innovative approach to training deep learning models in image classification tasks, using a reward-based optimization function akin to the vanilla policy gradient method in reinforcement learning, instead of the conventional cross-entropy loss function. Our method was tested on the cifar10 dataset and demonstrated superior robustness and generalization capability, with test accuracy and train accuracy varying by less than 2% compared to the cross-entropy method.",1
"Humans can robustly localize themselves without a map after they get lost following prominent visual cues or landmarks. In this work, we aim at endowing autonomous agents the same ability. Such ability is important in robotics applications yet very challenging when an agent is exposed to partially calibrated environments, where camera images with accurate 6 Degree-of-Freedom pose labels only cover part of the scene. To address the above challenge, we explore using Reinforcement Learning to search for a policy to generate intelligent motions so as to actively localize the agent given visual information in partially calibrated environments. Our core contribution is to formulate the active visual localization problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and propose an algorithmic framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to solve it. We further propose an indoor scene dataset ACR-6, which consists of both synthetic and real data and simulates challenging scenarios for active visual localization. We benchmark our algorithm against handcrafted baselines for localization and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms them on localization success rate.",0

"With deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods achieving results that exceed human capabilities in games, robotics, and simulated environments, continued scaling of RL training is crucial to its deployment in solving complex real-world problems. However, improving the performance scalability and power efficiency of RL training through understanding the architectural implications of CPU-GPU systems remains an open problem. In this work we investigate and improve the performance and power efficiency of distributed RL training on CPU-GPU systems by approaching the problem not solely from the GPU microarchitecture perspective but following a holistic system-level analysis approach. We quantify the overall hardware utilization on a state-of-the-art distributed RL training framework and empirically identify the bottlenecks caused by GPU microarchitectural, algorithmic, and system-level design choices. We show that the GPU microarchitecture itself is well-balanced for state-of-the-art RL frameworks, but further investigation reveals that the number of actors running the environment interactions and the amount of hardware resources available to them are the primary performance and power efficiency limiters. To this end, we introduce a new system design metric, CPU/GPU ratio, and show how to find the optimal balance between CPU and GPU resources when designing scalable and efficient CPU-GPU systems for RL training.",0

"Thompson sampling (TS) has emerged as a robust technique for contextual bandit problems. However, TS requires posterior inference and optimization for action generation, prohibiting its use in many internet applications where latency and ease of deployment are of concern. We propose a novel imitation-learning-based algorithm that distills a TS policy into an explicit policy representation by performing posterior inference and optimization offline. The explicit policy representation enables fast online decision-making and easy deployment in mobile and server-based environments. Our algorithm iteratively performs offline batch updates to the TS policy and learns a new imitation policy. Since we update the TS policy with observations collected under the imitation policy, our algorithm emulates an off-policy version of TS. Our imitation algorithm guarantees Bayes regret comparable to TS, up to the sum of single-step imitation errors. We show these imitation errors can be made arbitrarily small when unlabeled contexts are cheaply available, which is the case for most large-scale internet applications. Empirically, we show that our imitation policy achieves comparable regret to TS, while reducing decision-time latency by over an order of magnitude.",0

"While reinforcement learning algorithms can learn effective policies for complex tasks, these policies are often brittle to even minor task variations, especially when variations are not explicitly provided during training. One natural approach to this problem is to train agents with manually specified variation in the training task or environment. However, this may be infeasible in practical situations, either because making perturbations is not possible, or because it is unclear how to choose suitable perturbation strategies without sacrificing performance. The key insight of this work is that learning diverse behaviors for accomplishing a task can directly lead to behavior that generalizes to varying environments, without needing to perform explicit perturbations during training. By identifying multiple solutions for the task in a single environment during training, our approach can generalize to new situations by abandoning solutions that are no longer effective and adopting those that are. We theoretically characterize a robustness set of environments that arises from our algorithm and empirically find that our diversity-driven approach can extrapolate to various changes in the environment and task.",0

"Causal models bring many benefits to decision-making systems (or agents) by making them interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust to changes in the input distribution. However, spurious correlations can lead to wrong causal models and predictions. We consider the problem of inferring a causal model of a reinforcement learning environment and we propose a method to deal with spurious correlations. Specifically, our method designs a reward function that incentivizes an agent to do an intervention to find errors in the causal model. The data obtained from doing the intervention is used to improve the causal model. We propose several intervention design methods and compare them. The experimental results in a grid-world environment show that our approach leads to better causal models compared to baselines: learning the model on data from a random policy or a policy trained on the environment's reward. The main contribution consists of methods to design interventions to resolve spurious correlations.",0

"Lithium-Ion (Li-I) batteries have recently become pervasive and are used in many physical assets. To enable a good prediction of the end of discharge of batteries, detailed electrochemical Li-I battery models have been developed. Their parameters are typically calibrated before they are taken into operation and are typically not re-calibrated during operation. However, since battery performance is affected by aging, the reality gap between the computational battery models and the real physical systems leads to inaccurate predictions. A supervised machine learning algorithm would require an extensive representative training dataset mapping the observation to the ground truth calibration parameters. This may be infeasible for many practical applications. In this paper, we implement a Reinforcement Learning-based framework for reliably and efficiently inferring calibration parameters of battery models. The framework enables real-time inference of the computational model parameters in order to compensate the reality-gap from the observations. Most importantly, the proposed methodology does not need any labeled data samples, (samples of observations and the ground truth calibration parameters). Furthermore, the framework does not require any information on the underlying physical model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable of inferring the model parameters with high accuracy and high robustness. While the achieved results are comparable to those obtained with supervised machine learning, they do not rely on the ground truth information during training.",0

"Dams impact downstream river dynamics through flow regulation and disruption of upstream-downstream linkages. However, current dam operation is far from satisfactory due to the inability to respond the complicated and uncertain dynamics of the upstream-downstream system and various usages of the reservoir. Even further, the unsatisfactory dam operation can cause floods in downstream areas. Therefore, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) methods to compute efficient dam operation guidelines in this work. Specifically, we build offline simulators with real data and different mathematical models for the upstream inflow, i.e., generalized least square (GLS) and dynamic linear model (DLM), then use the simulator to train the state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Experiments show that the simulator with DLM can efficiently model the inflow dynamics in the upstream and the dam operation policies trained by RL algorithms significantly outperform the human-generated policy.",0

"Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have largely focused on improving the performance of agents with the aim of replacing humans in known and well-defined environments. The use of these techniques as a game design tool for video game production, where the aim is instead to create Non-Player Character (NPC) behaviors, has received relatively little attention until recently. Turn-based strategy games like Roguelikes, for example, present unique challenges to DRL. In particular, the categorical nature of their complex game state, composed of many entities with different attributes, requires agents able to learn how to compare and prioritize these entities. Moreover, this complexity often leads to agents that overfit to states seen during training and that are unable to generalize in the face of design changes made during development. In this paper we propose two network architectures which, when combined with a \emph{procedural loot generation} system, are able to better handle complex categorical state spaces and to mitigate the need for retraining forced by design decisions. The first is based on a dense embedding of the categorical input space that abstracts the discrete observation model and renders trained agents more able to generalize. The second proposed architecture is more general and is based on a Transformer network able to reason relationally about input and input attributes. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that new agents have better adaptation capacity with respect to a baseline architecture, making this framework more robust to dynamic gameplay changes during development.

"Multi-task learning is a very challenging problem in reinforcement learning. While training multiple tasks jointly allow the policies to share parameters across different tasks, the optimization problem becomes non-trivial: It remains unclear what parameters in the network should be reused across tasks, and how the gradients from different tasks may interfere with each other. Thus, instead of naively sharing parameters across tasks, we introduce an explicit modularization technique on policy representation to alleviate this optimization issue. Given a base policy network, we design a routing network which estimates different routing strategies to reconfigure the base network for each task. Instead of directly selecting routes for each task, our task-specific policy uses a method called soft modularization to softly combine all the possible routes, which makes it suitable for sequential tasks. We experiment with various robotics manipulation tasks in simulation and show our method improves both sample efficiency and performance over strong baselines by a large margin.",0

"Recent domain adaptation methods have demonstrated impressive improvement on unsupervised domain adaptation problems. However, in the semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) setting where the target domain has a few labeled instances available, these methods can fail to improve performance. Inspired by the effectiveness of pseudo-labels in domain adaptation, we propose a reinforcement learning based selective pseudo-labeling method for semi-supervised domain adaptation. It is difficult for conventional pseudo-labeling methods to balance the correctness and representativeness of pseudo-labeled data. To address this limitation, we develop a deep Q-learning model to select both accurate and representative pseudo-labeled instances. Moreover, motivated by large margin loss's capacity on learning discriminative features with little data, we further propose a novel target margin loss for our base model training to improve its discriminability. Our proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets for SSDA, and demonstrates superior performance to all the comparison methods.",0

"Cooperative perception plays a vital role in extending a vehicle's sensing range beyond its line-of-sight. However, exchanging raw sensory data under limited communication resources is infeasible. Towards enabling an efficient cooperative perception, vehicles need to address the following fundamental question: What sensory data needs to be shared?, at which resolution?, and with which vehicles? To answer this question, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed to allow reinforcement learning (RL)-based vehicular association, resource block (RB) allocation, and content selection of cooperative perception messages (CPMs) by utilizing a quadtree-based point cloud compression mechanism. Furthermore, a federated RL approach is introduced in order to speed up the training process across vehicles. Simulation results show the ability of the RL agents to efficiently learn the vehicles' association, RB allocation, and message content selection while maximizing vehicles' satisfaction in terms of the received sensory information. The results also show that federated RL improves the training process, where better policies can be achieved within the same amount of time compared to the non-federated approach.",0

"We present a mean-variance policy iteration (MVPI) framework for risk-averse control in a discounted infinite horizon MDP optimizing the variance of a per-step reward random variable. MVPI enjoys great flexibility in that any policy evaluation method and risk-neutral control method can be dropped in for risk-averse control off the shelf, in both on- and off-policy settings. This flexibility reduces the gap between risk-neutral control and risk-averse control and is achieved by working on a novel augmented MDP directly. We propose risk-averse TD3 as an example instantiating MVPI, which outperforms vanilla TD3 and many previous risk-averse control methods in challenging Mujoco robot simulation tasks under a risk-aware performance metric.

"Model-free reinforcement learning (RL), in particular Q-learning is widely used to learn optimal policies for a variety of planning and control problems. However, when the underlying state-transition dynamics are stochastic and high-dimensional, Q-learning requires a large amount of data and incurs a prohibitively high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce Hamiltonian Q-Learning, a data efficient modification of the Q-learning approach, which adopts an importance-sampling based technique for computing the Q function. To exploit stochastic structure of the state-transition dynamics, we employ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to update Q function estimates by approximating the expected future rewards using Q values associated with a subset of next states. Further, to exploit the latent low-rank structure of the dynamic system, Hamiltonian Q-Learning uses a matrix completion algorithm to reconstruct the updated Q function from Q value updates over a much smaller subset of state-action pairs.

"We humans can impeccably search for a target object, given its name only, even in an unseen environment. We argue that this ability is largely due to three main reasons: the incorporation of prior knowledge (or experience), the adaptation of it to the new environment using the observed visual cues and most importantly optimistically searching without giving up early. This is currently missing in the state-of-the-art visual navigation methods based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we propose to use externally learned prior knowledge of the relative object locations and integrate it into our model by constructing a neural graph. In order to efficiently incorporate the graph without increasing the state-space complexity, we propose our Graph-based Value Estimation (GVE) module. GVE provides a more accurate baseline for estimating the Advantage function in actor-critic RL algorithm. This results in reduced value estimation error and, consequently, convergence to a more optimal policy. Through empirical studies, we show that our agent, dubbed as the optimistic agent, has a more realistic estimate of the state value during a navigation episode which leads to a higher success rate. Our extensive ablation studies show the efficacy of our simple method which achieves the state-of-the-art results measured by the conventional visual navigation metrics, e.g. Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), in AI2THOR environment.",0

"Well-established optimization-based methods can guarantee an optimal trajectory for a short optimization horizon, typically no longer than a few seconds. As a result, choosing the optimal trajectory for this short horizon may still result in a sub-optimal long-term solution. At the same time, the resulting short-term trajectories allow for effective, comfortable and provable safe maneuvers in a dynamic traffic environment. In this work, we address the question of how to ensure an optimal long-term driving strategy, while keeping the benefits of classical trajectory planning. We introduce a Reinforcement Learning based approach that coupled with a trajectory planner, learns an optimal long-term decision-making strategy for driving on highways. By online generating locally optimal maneuvers as actions, we balance between the infinite low-level continuous action space, and the limited flexibility of a fixed number of predefined standard lane-change actions. We evaluated our method on realistic scenarios in the open-source traffic simulator SUMO and were able to achieve better performance than the 4 benchmark approaches we compared against, including a random action selecting agent, greedy agent, high-level, discrete actions agent and an IDM-based SUMO-controlled agent.",0
"Optimization-based techniques have been established as reliable methods to secure the best possible trajectory for a brief optimization horizon, usually lasting just a few seconds. However, opting for an optimal trajectory within this limited horizon could lead to a sub-optimal long-term solution.

To tackle this challenge, we present a Reinforcement Learning-driven strategy, which, when combined with a trajectory planner, learns a long-term decision-making approach for highway driving. By developing locally optimal maneuvers online, we strike a balance between the infinite low-level continuous action space and the restricted flexibility of a predetermined number of standard lane-change actions.

"Despite its promise, reinforcement learning's real-world adoption has been hampered by the need for costly exploration to learn a good policy. Imitation learning (IL) mitigates this shortcoming by using an oracle policy during training as a bootstrap to accelerate the learning process. However, in many practical situations, the learner has access to multiple suboptimal oracles, which may provide conflicting advice in a state. The existing IL literature provides a limited treatment of such scenarios. Whereas in the single-oracle case, the return of the oracle's policy provides an obvious benchmark for the learner to compete against, neither such a benchmark nor principled ways of outperforming it are known for the multi-oracle setting. In this paper, we propose the state-wise maximum of the oracle policies' values as a natural baseline to resolve conflicting advice from multiple oracles. Using a reduction of policy optimization to online learning, we introduce a novel IL algorithm MAMBA, which can provably learn a policy competitive with this benchmark. In particular, MAMBA optimizes policies by using a gradient estimator in the style of generalized advantage estimation (GAE). Our theoretical analysis shows that this design makes MAMBA robust and enables it to outperform the oracle policies by a larger margin than the IL state of the art, even in the single-oracle case. In an evaluation against standard policy gradient with GAE and AggreVaTe(D), we showcase MAMBA's ability to leverage demonstrations both from a single and from multiple weak oracles, and significantly speed up policy optimization.",0

"Analog IC design relies on human experts to search for parameters that satisfy circuit specifications with their experience and intuitions, which is highly labor intensive, time consuming and suboptimal. Machine learning is a promising tool to automate this process. However, supervised learning is difficult for this task due to the low availability of training data: 1) Circuit simulation is slow, thus generating large-scale dataset is time-consuming; 2) Most circuit designs are propitiatory IPs within individual IC companies, making it expensive to collect large-scale datasets. We propose Learning to Design Circuits (L2DC) to leverage reinforcement learning that learns to efficiently generate new circuits data and to optimize circuits. We fix the schematic, and optimize the parameters of the transistors automatically by training an RL agent with no prior knowledge about optimizing circuits. After iteratively getting observations, generating a new set of transistor parameters, getting a reward, and adjusting the model, L2DC is able to optimize circuits. We evaluate L2DC on two transimpedance amplifiers. Trained for a day, our RL agent can achieve comparable or better performance than human experts trained for a quarter. It first learns to meet hard-constraints (eg. gain, bandwidth), and then learns to optimize good-to-have targets (eg. area, power). Compared with grid search-aided human design, L2DC can achieve $\mathbf{250}\boldsymbol{\times}$ higher sample efficiency with comparable performance. Under the same runtime constraint, the performance of L2DC is also better than Bayesian Optimization.",0
"The process of designing Analog ICs is currently done manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. This method is suboptimal and relies heavily on the experience and intuition of the experts. To overcome these challenges, machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for automating the process. However, the low availability of training data makes supervised learning difficult. This is due to the time-consuming nature of circuit simulation and the proprietary nature of most circuit designs. To address this issue, we propose Learning to Design Circuits (L2DC) which leverages reinforcement learning to efficiently generate new circuit data and optimize circuits. By fixing the schematic and optimizing transistor parameters automatically, L2DC can optimize circuits without prior knowledge. Our evaluation on two transimpedance amplifiers shows that L2DC achieves comparable or better performance than human experts trained for a quarter of the time. L2DC first learns to meet hard-constraints and then optimizes good-to-have targets. Compared to grid search-aided human design, L2DC achieves 250 times higher sample efficiency with comparable performance. Additionally, L2DC outperforms Bayesian Optimization under the same runtime constraint.",1
"In this paper, the problem of the trajectory design for a group of energy-constrained drones operating in dynamic wireless network environments is studied. In the considered model, a team of drone base stations (DBSs) is dispatched to cooperatively serve clusters of ground users that have dynamic and unpredictable uplink access demands. In this scenario, the DBSs must cooperatively navigate in the considered area to maximize coverage of the dynamic requests of the ground users. This trajectory design problem is posed as an optimization framework whose goal is to find optimal trajectories that maximize the fraction of users served by all DBSs. To find an optimal solution for this non-convex optimization problem under unpredictable environments, a value decomposition based reinforcement learning (VDRL) solution coupled with a meta-training mechanism is proposed. This algorithm allows the DBSs to dynamically learn their trajectories while generalizing their learning to unseen environments. Analytical results show that, the proposed VD-RL algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution of the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that, even without meta-training, the proposed VD-RL algorithm can achieve a 53.2% improvement of the service coverage and a 30.6% improvement in terms of the convergence speed, compared to baseline multi-agent algorithms. Meanwhile, the use of meta-learning improves the convergence speed of the VD-RL algorithm by up to 53.8% when the DBSs must deal with a previously unseen task.",0

"We introduce a new reinforcement learning approach combining a planning quasi-metric (PQM) that estimates the number of steps required to go from any state to another, with task-specific ""aimers"" that compute a target state to reach a given goal. This decomposition allows the sharing across tasks of a task-agnostic model of the quasi-metric that captures the environment's dynamics and can be learned in a dense and unsupervised manner. We achieve multiple-fold training speed-up compared to recently published methods on the standard bit-flip problem and in the MuJoCo robotic arm simulator.",0
"Our novel reinforcement learning method employs a planning quasi-metric (PQM) to assess the number of steps necessary to travel from one state to another, as well as task-specific ""aimers"" that determine a target state for a given objective. By breaking down the approach in this manner, we can use a task-agnostic model of the quasi-metric, which captures the dynamics of the environment and can be learned in an unsupervised and dense manner, for multiple tasks. We achieved significantly faster training times compared to recent methods on both the bit-flip problem and the MuJoCo robotic arm simulator.",1
"The current dominant paradigm in sensorimotor control, whether imitation or reinforcement learning, is to train policies directly in raw action spaces such as torque, joint angle, or end-effector position. This forces the agent to make decisions individually at each timestep in training, and hence, limits the scalability to continuous, high-dimensional, and long-horizon tasks. In contrast, research in classical robotics has, for a long time, exploited dynamical systems as a policy representation to learn robot behaviors via demonstrations. These techniques, however, lack the flexibility and generalizability provided by deep learning or reinforcement learning and have remained under-explored in such settings. In this work, we begin to close this gap and embed the structure of a dynamical system into deep neural network-based policies by reparameterizing action spaces via second-order differential equations. We propose Neural Dynamic Policies (NDPs) that make predictions in trajectory distribution space as opposed to prior policy learning methods where actions represent the raw control space. The embedded structure allows end-to-end policy learning for both reinforcement and imitation learning setups. We show that NDPs outperform the prior state-of-the-art in terms of either efficiency or performance across several robotic control tasks for both imitation and reinforcement learning setups.

"Deep Reinforcement Learning achieves very good results in domains where reward functions can be manually engineered. At the same time, there is growing interest within the community in using games based on Procedurally Content Generation (PCG) as benchmark environments since this type of environment is perfect for studying overfitting and generalization of agents under domain shift. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can instead extrapolate reward functions from expert demonstrations, with good results even on high-dimensional problems, however there are no examples of applying these techniques to procedurally-generated environments. This is mostly due to the number of demonstrations needed to find a good reward model. We propose a technique based on Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning which can significantly decrease the need for expert demonstrations in PCG games. Through the use of an environment with a limited set of initial seed levels, plus some modifications to stabilize training, we show that our approach, DE-AIRL, is demonstration-efficient and still able to extrapolate reward functions which generalize to the fully procedural domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on two procedural environments, MiniGrid and DeepCrawl, for a variety of tasks.",0

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in optimizing long-term user interest in recommender systems. However, existing RL-based recommendation methods need a large number of interactions for each user to learn a robust recommendation policy. The challenge becomes more critical when recommending to new users who have a limited number of interactions. To that end, in this paper, we address the cold-start challenge in the RL-based recommender systems by proposing a meta-level model-based reinforcement learning approach for fast user adaptation. In our approach, we learn to infer each user's preference with a user context variable that enables recommendation systems to better adapt to new users with few interactions. To improve adaptation efficiency, we learn to recover the user policy and reward from only a few interactions via an inverse reinforcement learning method to assist a meta-level recommendation agent. Moreover, we model the interaction relationship between the user model and recommendation agent from an information-theoretic perspective. Empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method when adapting to new users with only a single interaction sequence. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the recommendation performance bound.",0
